Unreliable earphones with high cost,1.0,"This  earphones are unreliable, i bought it before 15 days meanwhile right side ear buds got cracked automatically and it got divided in two parts, and sound quality is also not that much good but ok, one more thing bass is not good as it is a boat earphones.Guys,Also for the proof i have attached picsPlease see and think before buying‚Äã this unreliable product.Thanks."
Honest review of an edm music lover,3.0,No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.
Really good and durable.,4.0,"i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time, gifted first one to brother. This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear."
"A good earphone but with some issues, read this to find out more",4.0,"I'll get straight to the pros and cons of Boat Rockerz 255 Pro Bluetooth earphones.PROS:1. Sound- compared to the non-pro version, it seems to me that there's slight improvement in quality. Not that it is very noticeable, but a slight improvement.Bass- has got good quality and quantity of bass compared to others in the same price range. The bass is clean, tight and is not muddy like realme bluetooth earphones.Vocals- the vocals are clear and crisp.Loudness- it is loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment.2. Comfort- the earphones are comfortable to wear but without the ear guides. Maybe that's just me, but wearing along with the ear guides gave me pain in the ears which eased off once the ear guides were removed.3. Design- it is of neckband design that is comfortable to wear. The buds have got magnets in it which helps it stick to one another when hanged down so that no tangling occurs.4. Colour- comes in some trendy colours like yellow, teal green, blue and red. The youngsters would love this just for that.5. Fast charging- gets completely charged in just an hour and has got high voltage protection too.6. Sound isolation- nothing to brag about but comparable with others in the same price segment.7.Mic- the calls were very clear. The person at the other end told me that the voice was audible without any disturbances and indeed very clear.8. Connectivity- this has got the A2DP feature. So dual connectivity is present and I did not experience any connection drops of any kind.9. No Lag- there was no lag experienced while playing PUBG.CONS:1. Battery- this is the biggest gripe anyone could have with this earphone. The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers. Though there's fast charging one would expect headphones in this price range to last at least 10 to 12 hours but not Rockers PRO lasts for almost 6 to 8 hours. That's what I got out of them and that was not enough.2. Price- the asking price of 1599rs is high. You may get it for 1200rs during offers. Even then it is not value for money because of the poor battery backup.3. No auto on-off with magnetic buds- the feature which is present in Realme bluetooth earphones. This feature could have improved the battery life of this pair very much but alas it doesn't have it.Final words:Boat Rockerz 255 Pro bluetooth earphones are good in terms of sound quality and trendiness but lack in terms of battery backup. Though there are several pros than cons it all comes down to the battery life and this one loses out on that badly.Other options in the same price range - LoodAudio Everloop (good @1169rs), Boat rockerz 255( when in offer @ 999rs), Blaupunkt BE50(999rs during offer or even @ 1399rs), Sony WI-200( pricey @1699rs and high in treble), Realme bluetooth earphones(@1599rs poor in sound quality but better in all other terms).Thank you for reading. Cheers!!!"
Charging port not working,1.0,"After 11 days, the charging port isn't working and now I can't even return it. Wat to do ?? I know there is one year warranty but it is only been 11 days. C'mon boat, please send me new one."
‡§ß‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏‡•Ç Bass & ‡§ú‡§¨‡§∞‡§¶‡§∏‡•ç‡§§ Battery.,4.0,"Hey Guys,,,,,,, it's Value for money if you get under ‚Çπ1500. Bass was quite good it's thumping & Deep Bass tuned for Basshead type peoples. Vocals and treble also balanced if you used this below 80% volume. Instruments separation also quite nice. Battery Performance was Outstanding you got approximately 33-34 hours on 100% volume. While gaming little bit or minor delays in video & Audio but when watching videos on youtube or other video platforms on smartphone i didn't notice any delays. Also comfortable in my testing when using continuously 6 hours. Dual pairing worked. IPX7 water certification is good i tested it properly no issues. But you didn't get call vibration feature also no smart magnetic earbuds.I gave 4 stars because of overwhelming Bass on full volume.-:UPDATE CONS:- Guys still(9th feb) Using as primary earphone i Observed slight Hissss Noise in Background while listening music or watching videos. I observe more while not in use i means connected with smartphone but not in use or playing music. It's Big Con for a Audiophile type person. Keep it in mind before Buy."

Disappointed,1.0,What on earth is the use of buying such product when it stop working in one month....your happiness sailed off like a BoAt.... #Disappointed
Good Earphones with good sound quality and build quality,3.0,Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.
Extremely good BT earphones!! Loud and Super BASS.,5.0,"Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro."
Nice product,4.0,"Nice product,Rockers 255 pro is much better than Rockers 255....gud one from boat"
Not at all expected this on 0th Day of purchase,1.0,Right speaker is not working at all. Useless product.Big disappointment.
Running has become comfortable now,4.0,The sound quality is good. I mean it can‚Äôt be compared with Senheiser or Bose but its worth the price.Perfect to use while running; the earbuds are so comfortable that you wouldn‚Äôt even feel they are plugged in.
"Sound, build quality and battery backup üëå",5.0,Sound quality and build quality is good.. Battery backup is one of the best thing i liked in it.. Definitely you will enjoy the bass of this ear phones...
"Below average product, don‚Äôt buy",1.0,"Below average product. Not happy at all.Pros : good sound qualityCons : very uncomfortable, silicon buds are not soft. Bought a memory foam bud pair to use it.Battery life is just ok. Once give a low battery alarm, dies within 2 minLittle heavy on earsNo return possible"
Good product with decent pros,3.0,"The product is a good buy if you are looking for a decent Bluetooth earphones with a reputed brand.Sound quality 4/5)- pretty good with good amount of bass.Durability (4/5)- the material seems durable and the earphones are light weightBattery life (3.5/5)- It has a decent battery life of upto 5-6 hours playtime on 80% volume.Connectivity (3.5/5)- gets connected with seconds but sometimes gets disconnected within a small rangeCall quality (3/5)- call quality is decent, the person on the other end of the call can here you clearly however you need to place the mic exactly near your mouth. Sometimes the call gets distorted."
Not up to the mark product by boat.,2.0,The product is not worth for 1500/- rsYou can get maximum sound but no quality.It seems they have worked hard on Volume level but not on sound quality.Packing was good.Delivery was fast as it took only one day to deliver.Two stars for packaging and delivery.
Good Sound bad designed,4.0,This sound and bass quality is good battery life good noise cancelling is good but its wire is too long and uncomfortable which is not looking good wire is starting from top its looking bad but anyway everything is ok
Satisfied totally,5.0,"Got it today, really loved the product.. awesome sound.. i was thinking to buy the Airpod but a friend suggested this to me.. Why spend so much!! So i ordered this and this really is amazing.. it looks good.. have great sound and doesnt hurt ua ears!! I am totally satisfied with this and couldnt say about battery as i have got it, today itself!"
Don't buy,1.0,Rightside speaker stop working within 20 days.
Dont buy it.,1.0,"Although sound quality is good, but then whats a purpose of buying a wireless earphone when its controls (buttons) doesn't work. I bought this product withing a week controls where stop responding cant switch on or do anything.replaced it got refund bought another piece different color that worn out in a day.Both the time seller was "" Appario Retail Private Ltd"". So i leave it to your wisdom whether you want to buy this or not. I will never buy this brand at least from this platform."
Doesn't have AptX!,1.0,"As falsely claimed by Boat, doesn't have AptX. Could not use the AptX codec to play music on my phone.Though, decent bluetooth earphones for the price.Additionally, Boat products are not listed on the products subsection on aptx website. This means, they don't support AptX codec.Ps: Have used other AptX devices on my phone successfully."
Just received the product and one side of the earphone is not working,5.0,Don't you guys check the product before selling ? just received the product and one side of the earphone is working and the other is not !
Overall good but not that worth,3.0,"he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality."
Really boat beating all others in the price range of 5 or 6k,5.0,"I am a prime customer of Amazon and I always purchase a product after so much research bought these boat rokerz in the sale in 1099 and trust me I am blown away by these I have used sony and other headphones in the price range of 5 & 6k but this is just similar to them in this price range ""sound quality"" 10/10 ""battery life"" seems good not tested for as described but will update soon ""durability"" 10/10 perfect fit no pain no discomfort.... Really boat has done a fantastic job with amazing music quality with superb bass in all highs mids &lows ..... Just go for it."
Not accepting the charging within two days of purchase,1.0,"Let me tell you about the product in Details,1. Sound Quality is good. It is harmless for ears. Not too loud but traffic noise can't disturb you while listening music.2. Look is awesome but wires are too lengthy.3. Battery Backup 'WAS' awesome. Six to seven hours after 1 or 1.30 hours chargingBUT4. Product is not CHARGING AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS OF PURCHASE. And it is not acceptable. That's why the rating is ONE (lesser than one is not available though)I will change my ratings and review too but after the replacement or refund against this product.And one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes.RegardsSIDDHARTH"
Unable to connect two devices simultaneously,4.0,Overall good!But I am unable to connect two devices simultaneously. Please Guide how can i do that.Thank you!

Defective piece and disrespectful Policy.,1.0,"No matter what is excellent in a product, it doesn't matter if it doesn't turn on after a day.You guys are enforcing a replacement for a failed model.We can't keep working with warranty and keep the product in manufacturer's shed for days.Got shut down in two days. Boat needs to review this product.Bottom 14% reviews say the same problem, issue with charging.I have purchased 5 boat devices so far I am disappointed for the first time because of this product and ""enforcement"" for replacement.This leaves me no option but to stop believing in BOAT's own customer service for the problems posted by customers. Amazon just play with its policies. Its the manufacturer who needs to go beyond and hel it's customers.Refund me for this defective product and I would like to purchase a new one of different model or make."
2 minute review,4.0,"‚óæThings We Like‚úîÔ∏èBattery life is good enough to provide 10 hours of continuous use.‚úîÔ∏èDesigned with perfection to provide a smooth experience without any pain in ears.‚úîÔ∏èSound quality is decent and it offers normal to tremble and bit lower bass.‚úîÔ∏èComes at a very low price point which makes it perfect for that thing.‚óæThings We Didn‚Äôt Like‚ùåConnectivity time is really high that it can frustrate you.‚ùåDurability is the concern as some people have negative reviews about it.‚óæVerdict‚úîÔ∏èAs you look at such a low price point, there is no doubt that boAt is rocking in the section of great earbuds. If you want to enhance the music listening experience then you can easily go for other versions but if you have a tight budget then this one is the perfect choice to go for."
Defective product,1.0,"Defective product. Not working, had to return the defective product."
Don't Buy,1.0,This is very uncomfortable to wear as it is large in size.It's laterally coming out of the ears.You can't ware helmet while wearing this.it is more bad more painful.Bass is too loud... instrument separation is bad.Not worth the price.Only colour of the product is best...and rest of the things are worst.Go for another one.
255>>255 pro>>>255 pro+,1.0,"I have boat rockerz 255, I got my younger sister boat rockerz 255 pro..This one I bought for my younger brother..And guess what among the 3...These ones are most expensive and yet the worst soundwise...Even pro sounds better than this pro+..More battery, different not better design..and faster charging can never make for poor sound quality compared to predecessors.."
Frequent failures.,1.0,"The item has been rendered defective three times in less than two months of usage. The first two times was due to charging issue and the third time due to sound distortion. Being under warranty, the item has been repaired the first two times and now I have registered a compliant for the third failure. The product has spent more time at the service centre than I have used it. Am completely dissatisfied with the reliability of the product."
Really Cheep Quality,2.0,"Boat blue tooth 255, ye doubt Voice quality is amazing for 30 days or so you will be big FAN or Boat but after 30days.. voice from of the side going down and even after 35 days you will not be able to hear anything from one sideBoat Service on same again so pathetic , raise an complaint almost 10days back  for replacement or rapair but after 10days its reaches to their rapir center, not sure how many more days Boat will take to repair... Big Suggestion DO NOT BUY THIS"
Read carefully!!!,5.0,"I just brought it in last week, and to be very frank,it's really Awesome. Beyond my expectations.Sound quality is like having your own personal home theatre,too clear and loud enough, you can listen every single bit of music.And coming to battery backup, they said it's 6hrs but it's more than that, for me it's working near about one and more.I will say,Go for it."
Not so good,1.0,Battery is faulty
Not the worth,1.0,I had brought the piece after reading lot of reviews etc. when i purchased and started using it turned off and said battery low .. Thats fine as initial product charged battery full and started using it ..It started reconnecting most of time and sound started disappearing . I checking the range on the manual which said 10m and i saw when i placed my mobile in shirts pocket it was perfect and working and when i moved it to pants pocket it disconnected and reconnected . and it kept happening with 100% charge and was totally waste of time and value for this .Tried many times and got to know its very small range one and doesnt come with proper range.
Average,3.0,"It has fast charging and dual connectivity but i have noticed some issues. While using it, i can hear some noise through the headset and when i stop playing music or videos after 25 sec a small tik sound comes and the noise stops. If it is just connected and not playing anything, no noise can  be heard.Another thing is that, it doesn't show battery charge correctly. Sometimes it shows sudden drop in charge and the next second it shows full charge without recharging.If anyone has the same issues kindly  comment your experience. This is my second headset after replacement.Both have the same issue.While using it, i can hear some noise  through the headset, just like the noice that is heared while tuning a radio and when i stop playing music or videos after 25 sec a small tik sound comes and the noise stops. If it is just connected and not playing anything, no noise can  be heard.Is that usual?Does anyone have the same issue?"
Review after 2 days of continuous use,3.0,Pros:1. Good base 8/102. Very good mic 10/10Cons :1. Mids are 3/102. Treable 5/103. Worst thing battery indicator does not show actual bettery level properly. It jumps from 100 percent to 60 percent then directly 0.4. Fast charging supported but after full charge it only lasts 4 to 4.5 hrs.5. Dont buy Sea green color it looks very old and blackish.Overall its average in sound quality but very good for calling.
Ok quality,1.0,The headphones were good at the beginning but after a week getting disturbance on left side earpiece which stays for sometime
Bad quality and pathetic after sales service,1.0,One of the worst headphones that I have used in recent times.  My headphones suddenly stopped charging after 2 months of purchase and I took them to the service center. They did not had any replacement available in stock so registered a complaint. Complaint status showed that the pickup request will be generated in 1 business day. Nothing happened even after 2 days. I needed a replacement urgently as I was working without any headphones so I called customer care again. I got a standard reply that you will get the resolution in the next 48 hours. Nothing moved. I again called them after 3 days ( 7 days since my complaint was registered). The executive on the other side said that the issue will be resolved in the next 72 hours. I kept on telling her that I am without headphones and if I don't get the resolution immediately then I will be forced to buy a new headset and that would not be just.  I was appalled by the unprofessionalism of an executive on-call. She was totally unaware of the actual problem on why replacement is getting delayed and despite my request refused to even come back on it or provide any assistance of any sort except 72 hours rant.@boat If the warranty of the product has not been honored even after a week then it's the same as not giving a warranty at all. Please remove all the false claims from portals.
Awesome bass and battery life,5.0,Awesome bass. This is even at low volume. So if bass is your thing these are the earphones for you. Really like the sound. There could be more clarity but nonetheless these are good.Great battery life as well. Lasts about 5-6 hours.The only grouse is that they are not very comfortable. I changed the plugs to the smallest but my ears still hurt. Maybe just takes getting used to.Spent 999 for it on the great Indian sale. Definitely worth it.
"A Rock-Solid Performing Top of the Line Neckband Bluetooth Earphone @ Rs 1,500!!!!!",5.0,"First of all the Pros:1. Bass - I have used tons of Bluetooth earphones from brands like OnePlus (Wireless Z & Z Bass Version), Boat (TWS, Rockerz 335), Boult Audio (TWS) and Truke (TWS) including neckband and TWS types. But, none of them had Bass as good as the ones on the 255 Pro+. I have never before in my life listened to any wired/wireless earphone which gave bass as good as the ones on 255 Pro+.2. Battery - Company claims 40 hrs playback time on a single charge when listened at 50% volume (device volume). Even many YouTube reviewers have done reviews and said the battery life came close to 32-34 hrs at he max. Even another Youtuber said battery life will come around the 26-27 hrs mark (of course i never believed him). But Boy, I tested the music playback time on these on my secondary device. Kept the phone volume to 40% and the earphone volume to around 50% mark and I got a loud, bassy and enjoyable soundstage while achieving a battery life of a ROCKSOLID 47 hrs 52 mins before I started getting the ""Battery Low"" voice prompt every 1 min. At this stage the battery was at 20%. Close to 48 hrs against the company claim of 40 hrs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not sure why the company underplayed the numbers here XD.3. Sound Quality - At the price point of Rs 1,500, don't expect quality to be as good as Sony, Bose or Apple. But what i got was decent instrument separation, above average overall clarity, excellent bass (forget other options at any other/given price point). I am going to use these as my daily driver to accompany with my Oppo Reno 10x Zoom which lacks a 3.5mm jack.4. Built Quality - Many reviewers here on Amazon and Youtube cited the cheap built quality. Trust me once you experience the above 3 Pros, built quality aspect will become negligible. Also, I personally felt these very comfortable over the neck. At times I even forgot it was there.5. IPX7 rating - This is awesome at this price point.Cons:Human beings are greedy creatures. The way the battery life was performing, I was expecting to reach 50 hrs of music playback time xD. But come on, getting 8 hrs on top of the company claimed 40 hrs is in itself INSANE!!!Few reviewers complained of a hissing sound. I never got one (neither while listening during the day time or night time).Bottom Line:I am planning to get another one if this one fails in the next 1 year. Am sure if taken care properly, these will last atleast for a good 2-3 years. Better buy these before gets out of stock. Going to do a review on YouTube soon."
Please don't buy this it's been only three months and it's one earphone is not working properly .,1.0,Very bad it's been only 3 months and it's one earphone is not working . One year warranty is useless no service centre service is there for help only waste of money .
Best For PUBG Mobile,5.0,"The main reason I bought this wireless earphone is Pubg mobile and I heard a lot of about Latency issues in wireless earphones but this one amazed me truely.1. YOU WILL HEAR FOOTSTEP WITHOUT ANY LATENCY ISSUE.2. THE BATTERY BACKUP IS ABSOLUTELY MINDBLOWING. (6-8 HOURS SMOOTHLY WITH 8/10 VOLUME RATIO WHICH I FEEL IS SUFFICIENT).3. THE BASE IS JUST PERFECT FOR GAMING AND MUSIC, NO PAIN IN EAR AND NO BLUNDER OF BASE WHILE HEARING EDM OR FIRING FROM AKM.I have used Rockerz 255, Oneplus Bullet wired and Mivi but nothing can be compared in front of 255 Pro.Best product with the best price!"
It's a piece of Garbage,1.0,Let me tell you that don't buy this. Yes it's true that it's the best product you can get for the price (I doubt that) but definitely it's not the best product YOU should buy.Problems faced:1. Battery is pathetic. Mostly gives 3 hours of playtime2. The earphones get disconnected if you even go to the next room3. Sound is too low. I have to use 3rd party Equalizer to listen clearly4. The bass is also not good. Have to rely on the 3rd party appsThe only thing is Boat has a very good warranty service but the problems with the device make it a garbage af
Average product,3.0,"The reason for this being an average product is that the pros are excellent but the cons also work against it.Pros:>Good noise cancellation>Excellent sound quality>Range is not bad>Good battery lifeCons:>The soft earbuds have a very small hole in it, so when you wear a helmet over it and if there is a slight change in the angle of the earpiece you are unable to hear anything from that earpiece unless you correct the angle.>Durability: The left earpiece of my headphones stopped working within 2 months of use. The company repaired it and gave it back, but the time taken for the same was long. Also, the left earpiece projects lower sound than the right one.>It does not inform when the Bluetooth gets disconnected after going out of range.>Becomes useless after the battery reaches 20%. It keeps informing 'Oops! Battery low!' after every minute for the next 10 minutes and then switches off."
Just perfect and amazing product.,5.0,"This product is just amazing....sound quality, its weight, its texture everything is perfect....you can connect to FM by connecting the wired earphones and then play it on loudspeaker....you can listen the fm from your Bluetooth earpiece.Don't think just go for it."
Not the Best Bass! EDIT: THE ABSOLUTE BEST BASS!!!,5.0,"This is my first time using a boat earphone, I was using a wired earphone with the company or brand I don't know, I've got it as a gift from my relatives abroad, but the bass compared to that earphone, this doesn't have much bass, I don't know everyone keeps boasting this earphone is specifically made for bass, I had to go to the Equalizer and tweak the bass, even though it doesn't come closer to my other earphone, the highs are high lows are low, and if I tweak more I can feel the stress on the little speakers, I had a concert like experience with my other earphone but this one is average, and should be priced around 800 -900, this is overpriced and overrated.Aside from the bass it's all good so far, bluetooth connectivity is good, range is good, call quality is good, lag latency is low, battery backup is good.And the audio codec is SBC, AAC is supported but every time I set it to AAC it resets back to SBC, based on my research you'll need aptx hd to change the codecs. Which this earphone doesn't have.**UPDATE**I CAN PLAY AAC NOW, IT'S MY BAD, AFTER UPDATING MY PHONES FIRMWARES I'M ABLE TO PLAY AAC CODEC ON MY ROCKERZ 255 PROAND DO NOTE THAT THE SOUND QUALITY IS AWESOME, SUCH IMPROVEMENT..GO FOR IT! I TAKE BACK ALL I SAID BEFORE.P.S ** YOUR PHONE MUST SUPPORT AAC CODEC BLUETOOTH V.5 WOULD BE BETTER, OTHERWISE THE SOUND QUALITY IS AWFUL I GOT IT WORKING ON MY PHONE AFTER AN UPDATE**"
All Over Very Good üòäüëç,5.0,I give 5 star ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê For Five Reasons1. Comfortable üòåüòä And Easy To Use2. Sound üîä Quality Is More Better Then Other Headphones3. Battery Is Just Like You Never Seen Before4. Design Is Very Great Separate Control Unit5. Deep Base And I can Connect With 2 Device At Same Time .Finally All Over This Neckband Is Very Good.. For 2021
Mediocre Earphone,3.0,"This pro + version has main highlight of1. Heavy duty battery2. Fast Charging.I can't see any other feature that can attract a customer.I had purchased this one for my hubby. I already have oneplus wireless Z purchased in a price of 2k. So, obviously you will start comparing it with. The oneplus had a very little bass. Hoping that Boat would have a better bass and 40 hr battery backup it would be a steal deal in 1.5k.Amazon delivered it in two days. Pretty fast. When I unpacked the earphone, my first impression was it's cheap material quality. You can ignore this for a moment. But when I connected to a phone, it's BASS quality disappointed me. Also it's sound quality is not up to the standard of even Boat 255 (which is now available in less than 1000). It's magnet do not work as switch on/off like in oneplus.Call quality: It's noise cancellation is also poor. (Considering it with a dedicated mic near your mouth).Overall I am disappointed with this."
Be Smart and Then you will be Happy,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Nice one the 2nd time. As I ordered initially I got a copy product and then returned it and later got this one and it works üëç(Tip : Warranty Card didn't Came with the copy product)"
Not symmetrical... doesn't fit properly..cannot return only replacement available,2.0,"It's good for the someone who need battery life. but it's very uncomfortable to wear as it's right side is more heavy due to volume controls.Everytime I wear ,the right side of the headset slide down a little as that side is more heavy."
Disappointed,1.0,Totally disappointed with the product and returned it. Boat rockerz 225 is better than this.
Average earphones. No AptX as claimed.,3.0,"It's an average product..!The Good:1. Fabulous battery life.2. Good quality mic and noise cancellation actually works.3. Sound quality is average.. very bass heavy, typical Boat style. Don't buy if you like balanced sound.The Bad:1. Where is the AptX codec support as advertised? I tried it on 3 different phones, with three different UI's. All the phone's supported Aptx. These earphones automatically connect to either AAC or SBC.2. Not comfortable for long hours as the earphones doesn't fit well. The earplugs feels cheap.3. Strange hissing sound in the background when not in use. Hardly noticeable, as it goes after 45-50secs, but it's there and can be annoying.4. Magnetic lock is useless as it does not switch off or disconnect calls. Its just there.Maybe Pro+++ can address these issues."
I have been using this product for more then 6 months.,5.0,"I have been using this product for more then 6 months.At the time of perchesing this earphone, i was really confuse between Realme or Boat Rockers pro.but after boot rockers pro, I am very happy with my decision.Very Good product by boat.I thought that 6hrs battery backup will be less for me but after usning i have seen that it gives more 8 hrs and it only takes 20 min max to get full charge.6 hr is for if you have been playing non-stop music for 6hrs.I put on charging only for 20-25 min in morning and use it full day without turnning off for a single minute.To be true the performance was amazing..Here is some key information about the product: 1.It can connect with 2 device at same time.I connect with my phone and laptop which is very benifitial for me, I attain meeting and online classes on laptop and in between any phone call comes on my mobile it automatical switches towords call and after the call back to my lappy. when i play video on both phone or laptop it automatical switch towords whereever video is playing. 2.support fast charging(only in the ""PRO"" modle). 3.Audio quality is best. 4. light weight."
Improved Quality,5.0,"The quality of Boat Rockerz has improved over the time.i used the headphones, and now i am using these wireless earphones, and believe me, the quality is improved way too much.And to add, i got them for a price of rs. 1499, and at this rice it is a steal."
Good product and service from boat,5.0,Purchased on 20/02/20 and It's stopped working. Neither it's turning on neither it's getting charged. Registered an online complain on 21/05/20 but till date there is no reponse.Complain tkt no. Is 1111830. Someone from boat team kindly connect and respond to help me out on this.Finally they replaced the faulty product and it's working great now.
Worst Experience ever,1.0,There's no clarity in sound it produces only bass that to it is not pure deep bass. It's sounds very local the mids n highs are the worst. One may go for it by looking at the price but trust me Bass in not the only thing to be considered the sound quality is also very important. Even the bass is not all pure it just sucks when u hear it for more than 1 hrs. I have returned the product. Please don't buy this product there's no Sound Quality.
Returning the item,1.0,Got the delivery today(12/12/2018)Initial Impressions:The Audio was really good..nice bass..comfortable fit.Audio 4/5But after few hours of usage the right earphone stopped working..Audio output through right earphone is not as loud as left earphone.
Not worth,2.0,Very disappointed with this pair of headphones.  The sound and make quality is very low.
The Beast in this Price Segment,1.0,Just purchase it with your eyes closed man. In 1500 bucks no-one will ever give you such a Bass and good audio quality WIRELESS BLUETOOTH Earphone. Just don't think so much.I don't know about the lasting of the product but feeling the build it seems very premium. This is my first day usage review.===‚â†====‚â†===Writing after 5 months of usingOne of earbud stopped working without any reason today.Pathetic product I must say now
"Not at all suitable for running, long run when you sweet it easily enters inside",1.0,"For the first month it was good. But from the starting i was having blue tooth connectivity issue. It was not even having good connection within 5metres. Then within 30 days due to sweating it completely stopped working. I am still searching for the right wireless ear phone which can be used for long run, marathon and resist sweating.Very poor customer care service. I returned the product and have to wait for 3 week for dispatching a new one. Still on 4th week no shipment done."
Amazing product üëå,5.0,Okiee.  After using it For one week i realized that there is chirp kind of noise when you change the video or. Change the song. ... This only the bad  side. Of this earphones Keeping this a side .Green color  looks fab. btw..The  sound quality is good.The battery life is amazing in 1 hours  it get fully charged.Upto 8 and 9 hours your  can listen music. Definitely go with this product .
Poor Battery and Connectivity,3.0,"I am pleased to write a review and i will talk both about pros and cons:Pros:1. Good Bass2. Sturdy3. Great look4. Good noise cancellationCons:1. Forget buying this if you are planning to use it for gaming like battle royale games, There is an issue with the latency or bluetooth lag, You will hear the noise 3 seconds after you fire the gun.2. Disspointed battery backup, max is 1 or 1.5. hours if you continously use it at low volume.3. Wrong place where the charging port is installed, difficult to plugin or plug out.UPDATE: AS OF TODAY, JAN 15TH 2020 - One of the sides stopped working within 6 months. However, I claimed the warranty and got a replacement in 15 days. No hassle apart from the duration to get a replacement."
Not at all Worth the cost!!,2.0,"I have been using the headset for 2 months. The battery life is pathetic. It might huff and puff to 4-5 hrs before the annoying ""your battery is low"" notification starts piercing your ears. The noise cancellation is avergae and the Mic is the biggest let down. When I use this for calls when I am in my room, my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us. And the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. I won't recommend this to anyone. I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this. Most reviews were rating it pretty high. So I have learned one thing, do not go solely on these reviews when buying things from these kinds of manufacturers, those might be paid ones..!Happy Shopping!!"
Typical unreliable Chinese product,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Bought it on 26th July, stopped working on 2nd August, couldn't send it for replacement on 3rd August.Getting irritating noise even after switching off the headset. Unreliable headset. Pathetic customer service and SLA for replacement is 20 days.Don't go for this. Bought JBL glide, it is much better in terms of sound quality and product build22-Aug-21.I got replacement product and it is again giving same issue after my running workout. I attached video clip with noise coming from the headset.Please stay away from this, because boat send some recertified or junk product in the name of replacement"
Hisssssss sound is present,3.0,"When i play song it produces ""hissssssss"" soundThat's really annoyingExpect that every thing is goodIt has awesome battery life"
Good but Noise cancellation is bad,4.0,4 stars just for audio quality with good bass but noice cancellation doesn't work.Prosaudio quality is really goodnice battery backuprange is fineConsnoice cancellation is bad while talkingIts good for music lovers who need a good audio quality headphones but not for those who need for calling purpose because the other person you're talking with will even hear the background noise coming from long distances like vehicles passing and their horn.Rest everything is good.
Average Headphone. Deserve 3 stars.,3.0,Ok at this price of  1499/- for normal use. I will not recommend this to music lover as sound bass of this headphone is not as expected from Boat. You can get better bass then this from cheaper headphones. Microphone catches very low sound so you needs to speak loud during phone call conversation..Battery life is the main pro of this headphone.
Value for Money Earphones,4.0,"So this is my take on the boAt Rockerz 255 Sports Bluetooth after one month of usage and hope this satisfies most of the queries here.Pros:------1. Pretty Quick Connectivity. It hardly took me less than a minute to get started with it.2. The sound quality is quite good. While driving on high altitude windy areas, the sound clarity is still clear and that makes me give it a thumbs up.3. The battery life lasts for almost 3 days and thats quite reasonable for meCons:-------1. Though there aren't many cons but yes the noise cancellation is quite less when compared to many other earphones2. Quality checks need to be taken care of since we had to get one of our earphones exchanged due to connectivity issueOverall it is a great value for money for earphones. Do pick it up,"
Not great sound performance but overall ok,3.0,"Hi, i bought this for 1500 from amazon but to tell you did not found out this worth 1500. Bought this after seeing 4 star rating from amazon users but seriously not worth 4 stars.1. Bass may be there but the sound is not powerfull and sharp. I tried to switch between plug in ear phone and boat wireless and found that the sound is not great although bass may be there.2. As some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel3. If you arr looking for style then it doesn't look stylish. The earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd.4. Noise cancellation is good.5. Ear comfort is ok.If i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.This product should be in the range of 600  to 800 maxStill if you need something desperately wireless and at some affordable cost then its ok.Have heard from some colleagues that you may find some good wireless earphone from Ali express"
Amazing product. Just go for it.,5.0,Close your eyes and just go for it. It is amazing at its price. I have got it at a festival sale which costs me 999 rupees. There is everything perfect in these bluetooth earphones. The bass is amazing even more than sony and jbl bt earphones. The sound is crystal clear. Mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. Noise cancellation is pretty enough. I am very impressed from these earphones. And at last these earphones are stereo supported so you can enjoy 360 songs and also play pubg with these bluetooth earphones. Really i love boat.
No Second Thought.....Just Go for It.........,4.0,"I got this product by 03/12/18 by 04:45 PM. Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon's insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.Pros:1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating ""You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255""2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. Music is so good to listen while driving.Cons:1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it's my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it againOverall it's a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this."
Bad sound quality,1.0,Worst product
Battery backup Best. Best for calling. it has mic closer to mouth. Audio quality is like Rs 100,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†This is a decent product. Frankly I found the sound to be exactly similar to any decent 100 Rupees wired Headphone. I have very closely checked and compared then all. I have 4, 100 wired headphones in house due to online classes.What I liked1. Amazing amazing and most amazing battery backup. I don't have to charge it too much.2. Build quality is good. They have provided the cap packing at the joints which most manufacturer haven't.3. Most Important is the what I am very impressed with-The extra mic attachment which is near to my mouth and that's very good. The benefit is it gives clearer sound what I talk on the call even though in traffic if Choas.4. Quick charge is amazing.What I don't like1. Sound is average. Nothing exceptional.  The speaker driver cone used is a very common every where available chinese wired headphones that costs 100 Rs. . They should have used boAt catagory speaker and not any 100 Rs. One.2. The call connecting and disconnecting, the voice command is not so quick and prompt. I have to press a lot of times. I have learn a lot to press the call on off button.4. The voice command didn't work properly for me.5. Even the volume level is exactly similar to Rs. 100 earphone which falls low when you need a high volume for calls . Then you have to plugin both the earphones. That's what I don't like.6. Bass is very very flat. Don't expect huge bass. You don't try to press more inside ears to get extra bass. You want get more bass.ConclusionSo if you want a great battery backup and no cable tangling go for it.For a price of 1300 to 1500 you won't get more premium product.This is an average premium brand product which is better then 500 or 900 catagory.Then if you want exclusive sound with exclusive base then you must opt for higher priced product.Ideally for average calling this is a best product since the extra earphone is not provided by any one."
Warranty,4.0,Need  to claim warranty one  side  speaker  is not  working
1 side stopped below 1 month.,1.0,At first it's look good. While using sometimes it fell out of the ears. I have changed all the earbuds to suit my ears but it fell of when you are looking down.Now it's stopped left side. No tanglin nothing don't know how it stopped. Don't waste the money by buying cheap Bluetooth.I had a faith in boat because of their sound quality which they had in small budget earphones but this one is not worthyBass is medium not punchy for that bass  you can choose boat basshead  ‚Çπ599 its very good.
Puchase it for sub 1000 price during offers otherwise it will be too expensive for its quality.,2.0,Purchased it for 999. And the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. Bass is still justified for its price. Basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons.  The startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. Could have kept very subtle.And also battery drains out quickly.  The microphone is the worst.  The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap.  Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.Also when I used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. I had to abstain from using it during morning jog.  After this experience am giving it only 2 stars.
Product Stopped Working in 3 Months Disappointing,1.0,"I have purchased the product on 7 Dec 2018 stopped working In Feb 2019, Reported it to boat, as per amazon, after a trial of email, the executive does not answer the call who was supposed to pick the product and drops a text that ""NO I AM NOT COMING"". I am left with faulty headphones now. What am I supposed to do with it."
"Worth for 1000 or less, just to have a Bluetooth earphones feel",2.0,"Hello I bought this product in big sale going on , got it for 1099 which is good deal.Later on it was for 2.5k don't buy at this price waste of money.Sound n bass is awesomeBattery not sure yetSongs can't be changed using music keys and music key functions are uncertainMusic starts playing from phone suddenly after the callDouble tapping of play/stop button dials last caller, which is greatest con of this product"
"Honest, unbiased review. Won't recommend buying this.",2.0,"I don't usually write reviews for products but I must do for this one to let people know about the issues I am facing. I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.*Reliability:*The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don't use it for like 3-4 hours. It's very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don't know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don't know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it's really frustrating, trust me.*Experience:*The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says ""Oops, battery low"". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.*Sound Quality:*The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it's not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.*Build Quality:*Build quality is really good. No issues with that.*Battery life*Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn't last that long as promised. But I am okay with that."
Best in 1299‚Çπ,5.0,"First of all. It is very comfortable. Doesn't fall from ear no matter how hard you shake head or dance.The sound is loud enough. Noise cancellation is awesome. Bass is good but sound signature is not so deep and quality sound you might expect. Treble is okay. Build quality seems very good it will last long. The magnetic strength is good and holds it secure.(not very good though)The bluetooth range is very good. Keeping it in the centre of my house(1800sq.ft) I can roam in the house freely without disconntions. And the bluetooth 5.0 offers dual pairing.It's micro usb, would have been game changer in this price if it was usb type C.Can't comment on battery life as it's my first day. And the fast charging is seens such a good feature.Thinking to test the IP ratingü§£Bought yellow color but will go for the blue one."
Deceiving pricing! Stay alert,1.0,"I bought this product after a long wait for drop in price for 1500 finally but just after few days of buying it for 1500, the price further dropped to 999! Really unhappy about having to spend 500 extra! Quality wise they're good but not exceptional. Also the eartips hooks are smaller than other branded earphones so not interchangeable with other earphones! I find it very inconvenient because my Sennheiser earphones have much better quality tips which I cannot fit on these as they fit lose."
Worst quality and service by BOAT,1.0,"Within 1 year, one side of earphone  wasn't working and then suddenly other side also not working. I raised issue to service center and they allotted one courier guy. They took away my products and then suddenly canceled my service related request. Now both courier service and BOAT company says that my shipment was cancelled and they don't have my product.The issue of BOAT headphones is too frequent with other customers that the company has to separately create one complaint registration format as you can see in the image. There are thousand of customer who have registered their complaint on the site. Theses are specific pattern of issues that frequently customers get."
No Aptx only AAC,1.0,Misleading product it doesn't have aptx. Also you will hear irritating hiss sound in background.
CEO level headphones,4.0,"It does the job well, pairs quickly,plays music and calls with decent clarity for the price it comes at. I feel like the CEO of a small startup pacing up up and down the hallway, with these plugged in while i take calls and act busy to avoid doing any real work.I just don't like that guy with the accent shouting YOU ARE CONNECTED TO NIRVANA and ADIOS AMIGO with such enthusiasm and that accent. Just a simple signature tune that's easy on the ears would've done the job to convey the action. Product team please consider this feedback while building your next set of devices."
A good multipoint option for Rs. 999,3.0,Got this for Rs. 999. A great deal for the price.Bought it socially for multipoint features.Works great with 2 mobiles but I have found that it keeps running into connecting issues with a Windows 10 laptop. It may take a while to connect back with a Windows 10 laptop.Battery is okay. Can't take it off the whole day.Don't expect noise cancellation. Sound is great. You can enjoy bass. Another little annoying thing apart from connecting with Windows Laptop is the crackling sound which I can hear sometime for no reason even in close proximity of the streaming device.
not working within 1 month,1.0,Product not working within 1 month from purchase
Sound Quality is not good,2.0,"I received this product yesterday. During testing i feel below are drawbacks of this product.1. I can't listen for longer time. Because, getting pain in years even with low volume. May because of iron buds.2. Bass is too much. This sound disturbs actual music3. Overall music is not good i feel. Earlier i was using JBL (Infinity).  that is much better and will get at same price.4. Another drawback is, there is no refund policy for this product.If you're okay to keep this product even if it is not good, then you can buy it."
"Good product, go for it.",5.0,"The battery is superb. It comes fully charged with the package. The bass is good.  It comes with the fast charging support with which it can last for 10 hours at 60% volume with only 10 minutes of charging. But the there is a slight hiss sound when the device is connected to mobile and not playing any sound. The loudness would seem a bit low at the starting but as you use it for some time, it would get active and sound as the best quality headphones. I loved the wireless earphones. These are the best earphones at cost of ‚Çπ1499 as per my opinion. Go for it. You would love them."
Good sound quality and OK noise cancellation,1.0,Have been using this headphone for past 2-3 weeks.Charges quickly and gives long play on single charge. Bass is also OK even at high volumesBut be careful of price. Actual price for pro model is only 999 but I was made to pay 1599 - really pathetic double pricing strategy.
Don't bother yourself by paying unnecessary attention to cribbing and negative comments.,5.0,"Let the process of burn-in take place on your earphones for few days. Then you'll understand how superb these earphones are! Kindly don't bother paying attention to the negative comments which are without pith or substance. These have exceptionally good battery backup and sound quality especially bass. The sound quality improves amazingly with the usage. Call quality and Bluetooth connectivity is superb!! However, built quality of the neackband isn't as per my liking as I like heavy duty and sturdiness. Be as it may, the built quality is good. I would definitely recommend buying these."
Good but not Very good,1.0,Its not sweat proof that is clear it will malfunction when you run on treadmill wearing itSound is goodBattery is goodbut its not full sweatproofAlso will stop working after one month
Quality good but ill fitting,3.0,"I have earlier used two Boat earphones, and this was my third purchase.Packaging - great. It came in a box which includes extra eartips, manual, USB charger, earphones and a case.Sound quality - good at the price range. The bass is strong, good for edm.Bluetooth connectivity - good, both range wise and quick pairing. It has two device pairing. I earlier had connectivity issues between Lenovo devices and boat, none this time.Noise cancellation - decent.Fit - the earbuds aren't the most comfortable but shouldn't be any pain with moderate use. Also, it is unlikely to fall off with fast walk or jogging. However, the neckabamd seems flimsy.What I didn't like - I have never been a fan of neckband style earphones. And these looked ill fitted. The neckband and the wires are bigger than required.I didn't use it for the ill fitting so would have to cut the review short."
Bad experience,1.0,The unit stopped charging within months of purchase. Was replaced by boat in 10 days of complaint with a refurbished unit. The replacement provided was faulty with distortion of sound in one side and a 5 hour charge lasted for only 30 mins. Had to raise another complaint. Seems they don't do proper quality check before giving replacement. Will update on this basis the experience of the second complaint raised.
Much Better than boAt Rockerz 255 Pro in every aspect,5.0,"I had recently brought boAt Rockerz 255 Pro and boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+.In comparison , i felt audio quality is more or less same, but much more refined bass in boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+.boAt Rockerz 255 Pro has over powering bass. Also , i tweaked my phones equalizer to meet my bass/treble expectation.My primary usage model  was to attend my office skype/teams meetings calls. boAt Rockerz 255 Pro use to drain out in a day and requiring recharge everyday. Thanks to bigger battery in boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ , Now i am using for my 5th day without recharging. Its works like a charm. Call quality is really good and better than boAt Rockerz 255 Pro, due to close proximity of the mic to the mouth.build quality is ok, decent.surely recommend , if u r looking for a mix of entertainment and official usage.I also own , a Sony xb400 and sony xb900n.Audio wont reach the quality of sony. but still its pretty decent for the price u pay. Cant complaint"
Hissing sound allwas hearing this neckband,2.0,Hissing sound found when connect to any phone bad experience
Worst quality control or refurbished or fake product.,2.0,"I just returned mine today. I have used rockerz 255 before and I know build was not at all bad. But this Product looks like a cheap knock off. batteryenclosure has gap, not sealed properly. one earphone enclosure is not Sealed properly, has gap when compared to the other side earphone. I used it for 5 mins and got worried that the one I received is fake or refurbished. so I returned it. Amazon refunded the money within end of day. I am looking for a neckband with flat broad Cables or braided cables. This looked like best option but turns out I Can't trust appario retail also at times."
Not good for workouts,2.0,"The wire from the band to the ears is too long. Previously, I was using Skull Candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. Wouldn't recommend for serious workouts."
Waste of money,1.0,"It is too bad..this ear phones could not completed even a month it has been only 20 days..and it's battery getting heated battery running time getting shorter by the time today it play only 1 hour ,next thing is it has been 5 days since it's one side earhone is not working..feeling cheated.."
Best in class In-ear earphones from Boat.,5.0,"I am sceptical about earphones when it comes to sound quality. After Sony, Senheisser, Mi and now to Boat I was gradually looking for something that is lighter on pockets but doesn't compromises with sound quality. This time with Boat, I felt it is the least talked, underrated yet handsomely growing brand in audio industry. I bought this pretty looking Boat Sport Rockerz 255 Pro+ looking at the fair reviews and the astonishing battery backup it claims it provides for the user. I am attending college from home and have classes from 9 to 5 and then I switch on to my music. Well let me spill the beans for this long review here, the battery backup is much, much awesome than they claim, I guess. It's been 3 days after continuous usage day in and out, I checked rhe battery percentage before putting it to charge, it said it still has fkken 60% more juice to go the extra mile. I was like, are my eyes spoil or is anyone charging them behind my back without making me know about it. I even checked was anybody there under my bed other than me, but found no one. :D Jokes apart. I am still wondering what kinda batteries or technology Boat has that they made such earphones that could last till the eternity.Cons- I hope I find any of those, will put them for sure. Hope I don't. JUST GO FOR IT!!!! Before you scroll to another review or another product. Happy Shopping ;) Edit- 26/12/2021 The charging cable I tried to use it for the first time today, isn't working. Seems to be of cheap quality. Just a filler Accessory to be given with the product and to add on the 'Included' list. Am charging with my phone charger just to play safe. The only con I have noticed as of now."
Awesome üòçüòç,5.0,"It's Totally awesome product. Nice Sounds quality manly it's bass is fabulous and noise cancellation is good not better but in this price range awesome. It's battery life also main part to suggest to other buy this product cuz m continually using 5-6 hours but battery not get down. So it's awesome product thanks ""boAt""üëçüëç"
Warranty Repair/Replacement is nightmare,3.0,"Honestly guys this product is good at its price. I bought this on 2nd January 2020. One side of it stopped working on June 2020. I called Support for a warranty they gave email/phone contact. I opened a ticket with Vendor and still did not get replacement/repair. Tried reaching vendor over the phone/email/ticket but no luck. Initially, they responded over ticket but from the last three weeks no update no answer. I finally contacted Support. They also initially responded positive but now no answers from them also. They(Support )  are asking for a denial letter for a refund. I don't understand when I am unable to contact ( given by Support) over email/ticket/phone how I can get the denial letter. Really disappointed with service from both vendor and Support support. So guys think twice before you buy this . All though  the product is nice, you will have nightmare for replacement/refund"
Waste of money. Stopped working in just a month,1.0,Just bought this a month back. It's not working now. It's not getting connected to any device.  I never thought they will sell such a cheap product with a high cost. I'd it really from boat brand? I suggest never buy this.
WASTE OF MONEY,2.0,I never except this kind of sound quality from a reputation brand like boat.  I'm very disappointed with audio quality and it makes hiss noise which is very irritating and painful in ear
Good bluetooth headset if its under 1K.,5.0,"Product design is good and very durable. The best feature is the sound quality and its design. However what i didn't liked is the battery backup. Its up hardly for 3 to 4 hrs if continuously powered on which requires to be charged atleast 2x a day. Overall I would say , its a good deal only if its under 1K or max 1.2K inr.. otherwise I wont recommend it."
Better than Realme wireless buds,5.0,"Overall, a steal at this price range. It has that thumping bass factor which is missing these days in most of the midrange earphones. I have used both Realme wireless buds as well as this Boat Rockers 255 pro. Here is the comparison:Pros:1- For a bass lover like me, this earphone is better than the Realme buds. It has a nice thump feel.2- Fast charging. Gets fully charged in less than one hour.3- Earpieces are magnetic attached to each other. This gives a good grip around the neck.4- Wire is dust and sweat proof.5- Battery can last upto 10 hrs if used only for calls.Cons:1- On continuous music usage, battery lasted for around 6-7 hrs.2- Bluetooth auto-disconnect feature not present when the buds are stick together. This does impact the battery performance. Realme takes the advantage here.3- No USB-C support. No big deal."
Waste of Money Stopped working in just 20days,1.0,Product STOPPED working in just 20 days useless even the 10 day return policy is over now no refund & waste of my hard earned money
Trash connectivity and Trash sound quality,1.0,"Coming from sony XB-50, the audio quality is trash but bearable. The connectivity is really, really bad though. It connects really bad through a body so basically, if you are wearing some clothing layers and its in a backpack, connection drops. Even in a running arm band on the same side as receiver, the connection is lost a lot of times as it stutters. Place 1 finger over the receiver (the bony part of finger) and connection drops. It doesn't even have good connectivity for 10 cm much less 10 m.If all you've done is used out of the box or cheapo chinese ubon headphones, these will be adequate but if you've ever paid for set of headphones before, this ain't it for you fam"
Captures Noise Other then Voice,1.0,"Updated on 4th January 2020:I read lot of review's like you, before ordered this product. But, let you View my review. Which is genuine.Audio: The quality of the music is excellent.Mic: Disappoint You. If you want to talk to someone, the other person will hear all the noises around you. Believe me. Even thought your far away from TV. It was capture it. This product doesn't have Noise Cancelling.Pair: You can pair it to 2 devices at a time.Battery: 4 hours continuous for music and movie.If you just want to listen music. Just go for this. Not recommended for phone calls.Finally, Hit YES if you like the review. Thanks"
Don't go for this product. Buy that typical samsung earphone.,2.0,"Reviewing after 5 months of use.Pros:1-Sound quality is awesome.2- You don't need to take your phone everywhere.3- You look AMEER.Cons.I will tell you sone cons that no one ever told you.1- That curved supporter which stuck in Pinna (part of ear) to provide more balance, start hurting in just 30 mnts. You have to use earphone without that.2- Every size of earbuds hurt your ear from inside.3- One side of earphone stopped working in 4 months and replacement process takes about 25-30 days.4- This is not only me who suffered this problem, all my friend who bought this product have replaced it atleast once in 5 months.5- USB cable which is provided with this product stopped working in 2 months.6- Ameer dikhoge to dost Party mangenge."
One of the worst earphone I‚Äôve had,1.0,"I‚Äôve been using this for past few months now.At first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.Operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.1. During charging there‚Äôs no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs not charging.2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can‚Äôt tell by touch if you‚Äôre pressing  volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you‚Äôre in a hurry.3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth, the earphone won‚Äôt initiate pairing(I know it‚Äôs not the problem with iPhone, because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.4. Double press on volume buttons doesn‚Äôt perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.6. Poor Battery level indicator: if the battery level is full, then you‚Äôd be rest assured that you‚Äôll have battery power for 2-3 hrs.If the level is less than full e.g 80-90%, you can expect battery to run out in around 2 hrs.So, the battery level indicator is not true indicator of actual battery level. Which means, you always keep it 100% charged if you don‚Äôt wanna risk running out of battery."
Not value for money.,3.0,"* Good battery life* Sound quality is awesome* Volume control and other buttons shouldnot have come with seperate part.* Build quality is good***** Missing a best feature that comes with other earphones, that is magnetic turn of and turn on.This made me to change my mind to return the earphone and buy some other brands.If we spend 200-300rs more, then we will get other brands with all these features.  Since this feature, is missing, this product launched at this time is filter flop. I must say it. And if the product was around 1k, then this might be good, evening we don't get that feature."
Not a single Star üå†üëé,1.0,"Too much of Bass. Even if you listen to a Coke Studio music or Trance or heavy metal, It's the same sound. No difference. You can't go next with music control. When you are driving or riding you can't change song. I don't know why people are giving such good reviews. Don't know for what goodness. Just because of noise cancellation. Or they don't know the tase of Pure music. You must be able to understand each and evry instruments sound clearly. Not only woo woo woo.."
Cannot beat this product and price,5.0,"This headphone is relatively new in market so not much reviews, below is my experience.1. Best headphones in this price.2. Sound quality is excellent.3. Bass is also good compared to other 10mm drivers if u compare with sony make sure ur comparing with 10mm driver headphones most sony Hps have 12mm drivers.4. Built quality is same as boat 2555. Battery is way too powerful than sony, both standby and playback. After proper testing it last almost 35 to 40hour on normal volume. Havent tested on high volume. Where as sony Hps priced at 2500 and above last only 15hrs on normal volume. TYPE C charging point which is better than b4.6. One imp thing earlier boat headphones did not show how much battery % is left this show 20% 40% 60% so you know when u habe to charge the headphone. On 40% it will last upto 8hours.6. Microphone does pickup background sounds but some noise cancelling Hps dont even pick up speech. I dint find any issue with this.7. Boat aftersales service is amazing and they have good amount of service centers so this also is never problem."
Worst Earphones! Stopped within a 10 days!,1.0,"Worst bluetooth headset I've come across.It's sound quality is good but not upto the level of it's wired earphones. And that too, only work for like 10-15 days, after that left side of ear piece stopped working totally! That's right! Within one minth of purchasing, this issue has happened. My only mistake is that, instead of returning it to amazon, I've sent it yo replace under warranty to the company. And the company took 30 days!! To replace it under warranty!And even the replaced earphone stopped working on left side within a week!This is just waste of money, and it's a chinese manufactured product, so obviously a waste of time and energy.I'll neither purchase it nor recommend it to any one. Save your money and buy some wired earphone instead else go for some good company as I've purchased 2 of these and both started creating problem one after other."
Its is an garbage,1.0,Its an garbage bro battery show 60 %next minutes it show 0% and the bt coverage not support even if your phone is in your pocket.while driving in 50kmph ...waste waste  boult and p tron is cheap and best from this garbage ..pls dont buy i stucked but you are not.
Great sound and call quality but having issues with zoom video call and YouTube video watch,1.0,Sound quality is good also the call quality. But i am facing a weird problem while zoom video call. Intermittently its getting disconnected and then automatically connected. Video also gets stuck and sound becomes cracking. This doesn't occur if i disconnect from Bluetooth. Also i found one more situation when it does have the same issue while watching videos on YouTube. The moment you connect Bluetooth all the following videos get stuck and the moment you disconnect all the following videos appear. I am planning to return this product. Above are the most basic requirement if it doesn't fulfill then there is no point to keep this product. May be it was a faulty or refurbished product. I would have definitely given 5 star otherwise as sound and call quality is great.
Wasted  1500rs  right  side  of the  headphone  is  stop working,1.0,After 3  months  right  one of  headphone  is  stop working  if  yu  loved  to run then  it is  not  for you  it  will fall  easily when yu  go  for  a walk  very  bad  Quality Wasted  my 1499rs  customer  is  not  receiving my  calls  they said  we will  help you bt  they didnt
One of the worst headphones,1.0,Don't go by the reviews. I ordered two and both of them stopped working in a month I raised the query and got picked up. I am still waiting for the replacement after 4 months. Tried calling customer care and write several mails but of no use. These are also made in China just when they realised the wave against Chinese products they claim made in India but the origin is Made in China. Note that
Not a great product but great for price.,4.0,"I got it for INR999 and that's the reason am giving it a 4star rating. For casual listeners , it has decent sound . I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you'll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the  connection gets lost. Moreover , since it's a  Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it's still running very strong though i don't use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don't bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There's no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.And now for "" Audiophiles"" ,well if you are one , you won't be looking at these anyway. So that's it . Happy shopping."
"Not as per the description, Quality of sound and plastic should be improved",1.0,"Not as per the description, sound is very low. Mic is good for calling but sound is not as per the price and hype.. It used cheap quality plastic.I like TYPE C charging and it's capacity. Only Disappointed with the sound quality.One more thing, If you use it under Helmet, It will hurt your ear üëÇ badly.. and it will fly from Neck during Bike ride and will slide behind on back.. unlike my previous Neckband.. i think it's due to it's very low weight and flat cable on neck."
DO NOT BUY,1.0,Would have used hardly for 5 to 8 hours since I got this product and it does not charge now. Return window already crossed and a total loss for me. Amazon stop selling such substandard products plz.
My Personal review after 15 days use,5.0,"Boat Rockerz 255 PRO @‚Çπ1299/-Review after using it for 15 daysAfter Battery low warning, fully charged in 30 minutes and whole day(4am to  10pm) battery backup (intermittent uses whole day or around 7-8 hours of regular use at 70% volume)Bass is quite good at 70%Superb at 90%Very clean soundMic is decent only catches human voice whether it's natural or recorded or TV ...No other noiseNo false remaining battery% showNo disconnection problem upto 20ftErgonomic design for regular useBut a Bit clumsy for running but we can adjust...I do use it for running purpose easily. Fits very good in the earWire length is perfect. Neckband is flexible can be folded and put in the pocket.Build quality is decent enough.I usually go sleep while wearing it.Teal green colour is very unique and my personal favorite (no other brand/model provides this colour)Magnetic buds are quite useful but doesn't provide on/off switch in magnetic buds... That's okaySweat Proof technology (not water-proof)Google Assistant/ Siri availableMy personal PRO - battery backup is very good at this price range (other reviews of low battery backup are so probably bcoz either they used it regularly nonstop or they used it at high volume 90%+ )My personal CON -Power ON You are plugged into NirvanaYou are now connected to Boat Rockerz 255 PRO& Adios Amigo - Powering OffThis is so irritatingüòñ"
"Please Don't by this product, don't relay on Amazon for service support.",1.0,"Don't don't  by this product...not charged even after  putting two hrs...not easily get  connected to mobile....poor quality....When I complaint against this issue they collected the product but not update feedback further to me  , and after continuous follow up with them they informed me that, they replaced the same and shared the Blue dart currier details  , I am waiting more that 2 months  still curried not reached to me , when I enquired with Blue dart they informed me that they return the consignment to BoAT why don't know ?.now more than 2 months I am taking continuous follow with them (BoAT) but no reply to my CONTINEOUS email reminders..

If u like bass go for it.,5.0,"I think the best Bluetooth in ear earphones.It has very good level of bass.-----------------Pros:------------------1)Very Good Quality of Bass2)I compare with other wireless Bluetooth headset but I feel it is good among them.3)We feel like surrounding sound with good quality bass which is feel like multiplex cinema4)Very lite in weight.You don't feel like so much weight on your neck.5)Very wide area connectivity.But I personally observe that it has pretty much nice connectivity in laptop rather than mobile phone.6)You can connect 2 device with headset simultaneously.7)Very Good battery life.I changed up 1 our and use it more than 6 hour.(3-3 hours continuously).8)Chearged up in one hour only.9)It has magnetic lock.5)It has IPX5 Waterproof Technology.--------------------Cons:---------------------1)Yes,we can change track with it but only in few devices.2)It doesn't show battery percentage3)In mobile phone you can face attenuation while you are on phone call.Opposite person hear some unwanted voice.But only when we are too much far from our connected devices."
Good performance but the earphones stopped working after some time.,1.0,"I had bought the earphones about 20 days back. They were working absolutely fine. They fit perfectly and sound great.But after 20 days of working they stopped working. They wont switch on. I tried charging with powerbanks, PC, chargers (I was very careful of not exceeding the amperage for charging and I didnt exceed the limit). Now to claim warranty I have to send this to the company which will take at least 10-15 days. This is very unfortunate and I am seriously questioning the legitimacy of this brand."
Stop functioning within 1 month .,1.0,"Waste of Money , Stop functioning within 1 month .After charging Also power not on .* Water / Sweat resistant function is Fake .* Fast charging is good but long battery back is just joke .* Amazon not ready for exchange and Service Centers are closed .I am just cheated by this product ."
Features not working,1.0,"Generally Boat quality is good but for this product i think it's patheticPoints:1. For voice call for initial few second(around 40sec to 1 min) the voice is distorted and the other party is not able to hear you, and in between also this problem occurs randomly.2. They claim connectivity with 2 device simultaneously , but it get disconnected in between.3. Sound quality is normal I have used ""Boult Audio ProBass"" and i can say that sound quality of Boult is more aggressive specially with bass.4. Seriously not worth spending 1600.5. Build quality is good.6. Want refund for this product."
"I am impressed, deep bass, exactly what I wanted",5.0,"# This is my 3rd purchase in family. Yes, in this budget it is that good. And time to this ""Made in INDIA"" product soon.# Light but well built, doesn't feel bulky# Battery lasts 6-7 hours, could have been little longer, but its fine# Volume and power buttons are of good quality# Excellent noise cancellation# Sound quality is something I didn't expect of this level - Good, very good. Good punch, high frequencies are delivered well, deep and rich bass. Loved it!!# Bluetooth works flawlessly# Voice reception via mic is also nice, clear to the person on the opposite side of the call.# It fits perfectly into my workout routine, or when I want to listen to Vedic Mantras during my sleep time."
"Worst call quality, Pathetic Range",1.0,"This is genuine feedback after buying this crap. I have Boat wired earphones and I am pretty happy but this one I purchased after going by so many positive reviews, unfortunately, its a crap!! Immediately asking for return!!Pros:Music and base is very good, base lovers' paradise.Cons:1. Fitting is worst, loose and if you jog or run it will be very uncomfortable and move along with you2. Range is pathetically low, I had pTron which without any hype was much better in range. I think instead of 10m its max ""10 feet""!!3. Call quality is pathetic and I feel mic is worst, even roadside 100 bucks earphone will have a better mic. If you occasionally want to call with this, just forget this crap!!4. Noise cancellation, CVC etc are marketing scams and nothing good for this CVC especially in little noisy areas!!5. Battery backup is knowingly very low, carry the charger along!!6. Material is cheap and poor, except the flat wire7. charging port cover is pathetic and will not last more, on top due to low battery it will be used heavily!!"
It is just Best among the other worsts. Just a Earphone wirthout jack. Nothing more to expect.,3.0,"It was priced around 2.7K initially. But I definitely know it doesn't worth it. I got it in an offer for Rs.1.1K. Still it is not worth the price. I was just looking for some stuff, without having to plug in the 3.5mm jack to my mobile - and it serves that purpose. Other than that, it is not for music lovers who wants to listen to music for long hours. in 30 minutes it starts hurting and I started to develop ear/headache if I continue to listen more than 1 hr. Definitely not suitable for laptops - it keeps disconnecting frequently for no reason. Recently it starts doing the same with my mobiles as well. Battery is not great with daily 1 hours of hearing battery lasts max 3 days. The string is annoyingly long, it dangles upto your stomach. I have seen earphones with reasonable length, this one is awkwardly designed. You cannot wear them without getting attention from onlookers.If you are ready to spend another 1000 bucks go for good brands like JBL, Senheiser etc. If you want to cut cost, well this is the Best among the other worsts in the market"
Disappointed,1.0,"While the quality is good, sometimes party on the other end of the call are not able to hear us. Also the external noise while is motion is high than our voice. Good for hearing songs but not for handling calls...After 6 months of usage....one side wire got tampered and no connectivity to one side now.....very disappointed."
One earphone is not working properly,1.0,Sound quality is worst
Good for the price but exynos devices don't support aptX so don't buy if you have samsung,4.0,"Slight 3 second delay to switch between devices but that's OK since we don't have to pair everytime.Apt-x low latency mode would work only on snapdragon devices and not on exynos. So latency is their for Samsung devices (mostly I noted on VLC player full HD videos and didn't notice much for YouTube videos )  . So if u have a Samsung device don't take it for low latency mode. And I guess it will be bad for gaming too. Yet to check for snapdragon devices.Audio quality is ok, not great. But can't complain.Mic seems good. Haven't done calls yet.Don't buy these kinda bands for running as it keeps hitting ur chest while running because of battery on both sides. Or wear a jacket over to prevent it from flopping around. Or put it under ur shirt.Just a review after few hours of usage.Will update after a week and increase the rating if I find it good."
You'll thank me later- DONT BUY Bluetooth headset of Boat,1.0,"MARK MY WORDS ..HONEST REVIEW- YOU WILL THANK ME LATER for this .I'll share pros and cons and my personal experience with BOAT SERVICE CENTRE WHICH IS WORST.Pros : Beautiful classy stylish look , Awesome Teal colour. Truly loving, magnetic earpods ,Sound is very clear over phone calls or while listening to music .Cons : poor battery , don't last even more than 2 hours , noise cancellation isnt powerful, that earcuff is very painful ,u can't keep it more than few hours and it falls off everytime.I had to exchange once I purchased and to the worst I had to give it to SERVICING CENTRE OF BOAT after 15 days of re-exchange purchase one . That one came after 3 months from service center.Imagine the poor servicing.Horrible just .Boats other products like Bluetooth Speakers and normal headphones are best no doubt . But never buy Bluetooth headset of Boat .MARK THIS FOR UR OWN GOOD. TRUST ME."
Bad quality and not a stylish product,1.0,"Looks bad,not stylishVery uncomfortable,Sound also not goodI don‚Äôt know about other products at this priceBetter don‚Äôt bye this productNo need to go for other reviews if u saw my reviewI can‚Äôt return this item because there is only replace option"
Not for official calls,2.0,"I made my choice based on the boat headphones with cable I have purchased in the past. But as compared to them, the noise reduction is really poor. in fact, it picks up more noise from the background. the person at another end can hear the bump sound of the car in a pothole while driving.These are not good if you are planning to use for official calls.Bass is TOO high. Bass as high sound good for metal or Jazz music, but in these headphones, it suppresses the other instruments.Fit in the ear is good and battery life is also as mentioned."
FOOLING PEOPLE IN TERMS OF WARRANTY,1.0,"We purchased this product which is under 1 year replacement warranty. When there was a problem with the product, we are to register our complaint as per method indicated in policy terms since more than a month now, but could not register till date. Instead of complaint being registered, each time a phone number popped up, which is surprisingly NON OPERATIONAL. We could not even talk their customercare number as it had an indefinite waiting time . Thereafter we tried to get in touch with them through Instagram, facebook and twitter, but to our surprise they just did not respond even then. Each time they simply asked for our number but never reverted back. It seems that they are simply waiting for the warranty to expire so that they can thereafter be free from the obligation of  honouring the warranty. Pathetic after sales service."
Best at the price but battery should be better.,4.0,Sound quality is awesome.Noise cancellation is awesome.Building quality is amazing.Got it for 1299 in a deal.Worth the price.Connectivity is great.Can play pubg also just very minor lag in sound and that neglegable.Only con is the battery backup. It's not bad but it should be more then 6 hours.Similar option is the Sony c200 just a sightly high in price and you get 15 hours of backup.Other con is the Micro USB charging slot.Sony provides the USB type c charging slot.Rest all perfect at the price.
Connectivity issue,2.0,"EDIT, After using it for 2 weeks I'll say you honestly what I witness,1- Sound is not that much, earphone is not that loud.. you'll find a normal wired earphone many times louder.2- If you're using it to listen music, bass to be precise.. this is not for you, because this has very low bass compared to basshead 152,182,102 or any other good wired earphones.3- it's ideal for receiving calls and stuff, but I don't think wireless earphones looks good.4- I have been using it for 2 weeks and the problem I face is that if you use this earphones over watching High quality videos.. video will play properly but audio will buffer so much like we're steaming a video on 2g net.I have a 50 Mbps wifi, I'm using this earphones with realme X2 pro which has bluetooth 5.. and just head on YouTube stream anything select quality to 720p or above and video will smoothly but audio will buffer so much. So I brought my all earphones, selected quality of video to 1080p and used all earphones and my one wireless ptron earphone everything worked fine just I connected this with my phone, audio started lagging. At one time this earphone was connected to only my phone and my phone was only connected to this earphones but still idk what's the issue."
One of the worst bluetooth headphones available in the market.,1.0,"It is probably one of the worst bluetooth headphones available in the market. and this i am saying based on my personal experience.Apart from Bluetooth connectivity & Bass Quality issues, one of the major defect is that it is not at all sweat proof as being advertised.& since it is not sweat proof it stops working abruptly anytime in between workout & becomes dead for an extended period of time plus in my case speaker functionality completely stopped working within the first 2 months of purchase.I would strongly recommend not to buy this product if you are looking for a decent sports bluetooth headphones."
NOT A GOOD DEAL!,2.0,"PROS-1. Good sound quality, although bass heavy (as expected from Boat).2. Exceptional battery backup.3. Latency and fit are decent.CONS-1. Despite the claims, AptX is NOT SUPPORTED (Tried on both Snapdragon and Exynos devices), though AAC is good enough.2. Very poor build quality, and unergonomic design.3.  Slow response from buttons, it takes at least 1 second for commands to get executed.4. No auto-pause/play or on/off functionality when attaching the buds using magnets. Also, magnet quality is flimsy.5. Multi-device connection supported, but cannot switch between devices. It will only play from the device that was connected first. Only way to switch devices is to disconnect the first one, which essentially renders this feature useless.6. As many people have pointed out, a continuous hissing sound is present when nothing is being played. It's not that noticeable, but it shouldn't have been there.Overall, not a bad pair of earphones, but adding a few hundred rupees and going for oppo/oneplus would be better value for money."
Seems Satisfactory,4.0,"Day 2 (Aug 12th 2019)I watched videos and listen to few songs. It did not hurt in ear. My purpose of buying them was for calls only. I do find them good. I checked with few people through Skype as well. It was good. It did last for more than 6 hours. When I received it was 100% charged. I started using it. Today the only challenge I saw was it was not connecting with my Bluetooth when it was left with 20% battery. I put it on charge. It recharged within the time of 1 hour or so.Date : August 17,  2019 - I am not music freak but the quality and sound is good for music. I majorly use it for my long day calls through Skype. In starting it was good, there were no issues. After few days I started facing connectivity issues. On 15th I was watching something or other whole day. I noticed that till the time I was using it the battery % was 100. I took a break and reconnected it was like 80%. This was the percentage after a regular play time of approx 3 hrs. Suddenly it started giving audio message ,oops and all that . The battery was showing 20% and it turned off at 20% battery. This was little upsetting for me. I requested for a replacement so I will be getting it on Aug 20, 2019.In this 1 year I have used 5 Bluetooth earphones. iBall, U8i, Samsung Muffspro and boAT. To give them a rank it will like this (Best at 5)1. Samsung2. iBall3. Muffspro4. U8iAnd the winner among them is boAT.This review is completely after using these mentioned headphones for more than 4 hour each day. The review is based on Battery,Sound Quality, Ease of talking on phone,  Ear comfort. All these products were under 3000 INR.The best part about boAT is quality, durability and battery. I might be buying an upgrade device of it soon."
Honest review after 20 day.,4.0,this headset very good.But not owsome.It sound quality good battery backup also good it gives 5 to 5.30 hour sometimes it give 6 to 7 hour when you play 50 to 60 % valume. And it take 40 minutes to get full charge.company claim 1 hour but 40 minutes fully charged.Comfort after 2 hour start paining in ear and also in running it move.if you think battery don't very battery is owsome Becouse it comes with ASAP fast charging.Sound- 8/10Bass- 9/10Battery- 7.5/10 (because realme also good)Charging- 8.5/10Built qulty.- 8/10(because not arjustable)Comfort- 6/10Sound delay - 8/10. If you are normal  gamer than it is good.
Updated review,3.0,"First impression:Just unpacked and pairing was very easy. I was able to pair this to my OnePlus 5T and Laptop. After pairing my phone first, I switched off the bluetooh in phone and paired with my PC. Then switched on the bluetooth in phone. Played music from PC and when I received a call in my phone, the headset goes silent and the music automatically pauses. Exactly the way I wanted. However, one drawback is that when the phone call ends, the music doesnt resume automatically.Sound Quality is good - Good bass - Comfortable to wearSuggestion for the manufacturer:As soon as the device is paired, not sure why the voice says ""You plugged into Nirvana""?And instead of referring the connected device name, the headphone voice says ""You are connected to Boat Rockerz"".. Shouldnt this be the name of the connected device..(Mobile name or the laptop name)?"
Do not go for it,1.0,After all searches and watching review on YouTube I decided to go for this however I have been disappointed with the quality it offers in terms of sound with maximum bass it look like we are using roadside earphone as well as the volume is also to low or I don't know if I got duplicate product the seal was present but the box was already opened when I received it.Not recommend anyone I did used other boat product which I found worth of however this one not even ‚Çπ200 worth.
Not upto mark,1.0,"Very limited battery life, gets unpaired from all devices if even one device is unpaired .Not great sound quality. Has a very irritating fake English ( Spanish) voice warning that can drive you up the wall. The usb charging socket is very difficult to reach . The rubber cap which fits the charging socket will break and render the headphone with no protection from sweat or water. There is no active noise cancellation. Outside sound will get damped only if the EarPods fit in your ear properlyIn summary: do not buy if you need great sound quality, and do not buy just looking at the number of people who have reviewed the headphones.I did that and I find my money wastedThe only good part- ear fitting is good and it comes in a variety of colours."
NOT MUCH CHANGE THAN 255,2.0,"CONS--1299 INR--NOISE CANCELLATIONBATTERY LIFE IS OK AS MENTIONED 7-8 HOURSCONS--HEAVY ON BASS(I HAVE USED SENNHEISER, SKULLCANDY AND PIXEL BUDS IN PAST SO I KNOW SOUND QUALITY)-- NO STANDARD BALCK COLOR (YELLOW RED DOESN'T SUIT PROFESSIONAL) NEITHER GEERN ONE."
"BoAt - Bad products, horrible service, and no ethics.",1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Bad product, below average sound. Extremely high bass notes with a lot of distortion in sound at high volume. The product started malfunctioning in 10 days. I had to go to the service centre and ask them to ask the brand for a replacement. I received a broken product as replacement. Once again, i had to go to the service centre and place a complain for a replacement of a supposed 'replacement'. I finally received the second replacement, but the product was damaged. It had scruff marks on the volume-rocker switch, and the battery case of the neckband. The noise cancellation is non existent. The bass and treble is so high, even listening to some pleasant music on this earphones will give you a migrane. The brand has no ethics. This is my first purchase from BoAt, and most definitely my last."
"Spend a few hundred rupees more and get the Boat Rockerz 255 pro+, it's a beast!",5.0,"I purchased this model (Rockerz 255 pro+) after reading multiple reviews here on Amazon. I previously owned the old Boat 255. I have to say, this is the best purchase I have made this year. I charged it to full upon receiving it and started using it just to see if the 40-hour battery backup claim is true. It turns out, it does indeed give the battery backup. I started watching Breaking Bad from season 3 and completed all the episodes till season 5 and have even watched the El Camino movie (that's at least forty 40-minutes episodes and a 2-hour movie). The battery still works, no signs of the battery being low at all. I purchased this for only the battery backup and I'm satishfied. The other things and bass and sound quality is all okay and is comparable to the rockerz 255. Just buy it"
Seriously surprising and unbelievable,4.0,"I am totally amazed with the product. When I read reviews and Youtube videos it mentioned battery backup of 14 hours or 16 hours. I had charged this to 100% on September 27 and today is October 13. I use it for almost 8 hours average every day. I use this for my mobile calls and for Zoom calls on Laptop. I can say the talk time I use is roughly 2 hours everyday, but the it is kept on for 8 hours average.  And today after 17 days it still has 40% battery.Sound is good, even when I am riding bike and receiving calls, it is clear for me to listen and the opp person also can hear me clearly. And I wear it on just right ear not on left ear.It actually worries me thinking if the there is some problem as I had not at all expected such good quality (battery and sound).So so far this is highly recommended by me."
Not at all a good one,1.0,"Dont go for this product. I have seen the reviews and purchased it but to my surprise, the ear phones are very bad at producing the decent bass,instead the bass is too heavy that even a bass head like me does not find it good. Too heavy to use it for longer times, u might end up hurting ur ears."
Okay,3.0,"When connected to my cellphone (galaxy s9) it would show battery 80%. Exactly 80%, not less or more than 80. It would show battery to be 80% even if the battery is down and suddenly after using for 1 hour it would come down 20% and at that point it would say that battery is low. But it would keep saying low battery until it's shut down. Even if you can listen to a 3 min. song in low battery, it would keep saying low battery in between the song .Got it for 1100 rs. so cannot complain a lot.Thanks !"
Better than most in this price,5.0,"ProsQUALITY is amazing. Very durable. Easy on ears. Looks premium.COMFORTABLE to wear. Only issue was the ear extentions provided. Which i had to remove. And after removing them, it feels much better.Light weight.SOUND is great. Its clear. Noise cancellation works as described. Bass is not too much though. I could hear every sound in a song, even minute beats in background. Which my previous headphones from premium companies also couldn't do. So sound is superb.RANGE is good too. I can hear the music clearly crossing two rooms. So has good range.CALL quality is good. I hardly use it for calls,only for music, so cannot review in details. But once i picked a call with it and it worked fine. I could hear and other person could hear me well. No issues.BATTERY life is beyond expectations. It will last at least a week even if you listen to music all day, watch videos etc or even keep it plugged. You don't have to worry. Its the best thing ever. Battery life is this earphone's best feature.ConsBASS is not as good. Even if there's focus on bass in the name of this earphone, still its normal, neither bad nor awesome.ANNOYING VOICE instructions! This could be a personal thing, but the inbuild voice instructions everytime i turn on and turn off is bit annoying. If there was a way to at least change the language or voice.BIT HEAVY for my ears. One earpiece always comes out. Takes time to adjust.BUTTONS arrangement could have been better. It takes time to adjust to the buttons. The next track/vol up button is placed below, it should be up.VerdictGo for it if you want great battery life (i think its unbeatable in this feature) Very clear sound quality, okay bass, premium feeling, ease, durability and bang for the buck. üëçüèΩ"
Worst products selling by Amazon on his plateform.,1.0,"Hey Amazon read carefully, I will give it only 1 star after using 10 months because there is worst customer service ever by boat rockerz company. I had 1 year replacement warranty but they were not giving me answer properly for replacing my faulty unit. Worst service and you Amazon selling worst units like this.Worst service. Really I become very annoyed in replacing this product.Also my prime subscription going to over of Amazon that I'm not renewing now.Clear message. Help and support customers or ready to suffer."
Not working as expected,2.0,"Product received on time there is no issue.  Sharing my experience here for you to decide before you go for this product only.During calls suddenly it goes blank.There is no noise cancellation or its not working properly.  Always people on call ask me ""are you outside, we are getting so many noise""I have ordered replacement, after 15 days i received serviced item (may be before that someone used and returned to boat), Same issue persist but now I don't know what to do... and I am not using this for important office calls.  Just using for hearing music & watching movies.  Replacement process is good, they only come and collect your product and return using courier, if you raise ticket online.  Problem rectified or not that's matter.Overall my suggestion / experience I could say ""Don't go for this product if you really want to use it for official purpose"""
Good but microphone sucks,3.0,"Guys if you are looking for perfect sound then go for it. Even on 70% of the sound you are deaf for other sound. 100% sound no disturbance in music.Call quality is good with phone (bit less, opposite person hear very less soundHowever, on other calling app (office) laptop connection microphone is not that powerful, a person on other end will hear very less of us.Connectivity is awesome as I connected with my phone (Redmi note 9 pro) as well as Lenovo laptop.Jumping from phone to laptop or laptop to phone it is so quick.Very crispy sound with impacted bass. If you looking for calling then I should not suggest this"
Poor after sales service! Unprofessional!,1.0,"I usually don‚Äôt write a review but felt the urge to mention the very unprofessional after sales service support so as to affect purchasing decisions.Usually i buy a electronic product after thorough research on the specifications, product reviews, price etc. BUT WE TOO NEED TO WEIGH THE AFTER SALES SERVICE.I had a problem of charging my earphones after 10 months of use within the stipulated warranty period of 1 year.Next I tried their Customer Care number but there is no online or on phone registration facility of the complaint! They send a sms link to register but the link doesn‚Äôt open (see pictures)!!Next I sought their service centre in my city Ahmedabad and found a single centre for the whole city some 10-11kms away. I reached the centre to be totally disappointed with the centre which was a small shop size with no parking. They checked and found the problem to be due to water damage to the charging point. Even though never has my earphones touched water, I accepted that and asked for the solution, but then the twist started!They refused to repair it even on payment basis - reason that they were just there to replace the piece if it was a manufacturer defect. They genuinely were not their for any repair work.They asked me to talk with the call centre executive to find the repair solution but the call could not be connected to the executive in spite of 20mins of waiting. I am trying to talk with the company for last 48 hours but every time the recorded voice assures me that My call is going to be connected in short time but no success.In short I feel that I will have to ditch the 1100/- rs product for just unable to get a customer paid repair.The thing I disliked is that in today‚Äôs smart world the boat customer website is not taking an online or telephonic complaint and you can not talk to the executive.VERDICT: I will definitely avoid BOAT products in future in spite of attractive Branding and cheap prices due to a very lazy service system."
Great headphones at 1250rs!!!,4.0,"Its bass is better that mivi colla 2 which I have had, still not excellent but better. Audio volume is also high thats good thing. Since mic unit is given on right side, it increases the weight and during running it dangles and right earbud something comes off from ear so keep that in mind for those who loke to use it while running.Overall satisfied with these Rockerz at this price and great battery backup.Also its Bluetooth range is way better, even worked clearly when two walls were there between headphones and connected mobile."
Below Average product,2.0,"Average Product* LikesGreat battery lifeDurableMagnetized budsFast charging* DislikesAt high volume sound becomes noisyRight side speaker stopped working after 10 months of usage.Unavailability of service centers at major cities.I have been a fan of boat products. Used boat earphone, Bluetooth headphone, Sound bar as well but this time got very dissatisfied with Boat Rockerz 255. Donot recommended at all"
Overall works !!!,3.0,"- Audio is good... Altho felt bass is heavy sometimes. Could have done with some software to control settings via Blue tooth or type c cable...- Battery is good so far - has gone from 100 to 80 in few days... Usage is not at all heavy...- Call quality is not that great. Wish they had bigger opening for voice to reach mic. Or if they had 2. Opposite person has to keep its volume to max. Like that the control panel is seperate from base and closer to your mouth...- build quality feels fragile... Too thin wires. If got pulled surely will break...- over hyped & priced. overall ok...----- Update ------ it has connectivity issue when you do file transfers via bluetooth... After files are transferred, there is lot of disturbance in this earphone... You have to swtich off bluetooth and on again to fix"
"Doesnt Last More than a Year, Warranty Process is Sham, Do Not Buy",1.0,"Ive been regularly purchasing boat earphones products since a long time. From wired to wireless and this was my first wireless earphone. Sound quality is good but the problem is, it didnt lasted more than a year and left bud just died. It usually happens boat products lasts around a year or so, but this one lasting 8 months was a surprising.Read warranty information, and this should be covered in warranty. Created a ticket on their support website. Received ticket number and email mentioning the pickup process proving the return shipment details and the waybill number. Problem is, it never got pickup up since a week. Here is the ordeal- You would receive a message for couple of days intimating pickup and executive number. Executive never comes for pickup. When trying to reach on his number, it says incoming is disabled on this number. SMS cannot be sent on this number. Overall you can never reach on this number.- When you email the courier company, you would receive standard email that it will be taken care or responded back within 24 to 48 hours but nobody cares to respond back- When you call the courier company number it never accepts the AWB or your mobile number- When you try to email Boat Support, again standard response to follow support website for complaint. Now, the website has only two options to create complaint or to check status.- When you call boat support, option 1119 will take to customer care execute. I doubt if any real person exists to take your call as it always keeps you on hold for 2 minutes and says all executives busy and we will reach you later and sooner but nobody ever calls.- You just have to follow madly but you cannot reach anyone here.All together, BoAt products sound good at consumer level but lack quality and now I think they are designed that way, not to survive for long, so you keep buying new ones every year. A desi chinese product company. The support is nothing but sham. A product which doesnt build to survive for long enough isnt a good choice, and I would recommend to buy something better with your hard earned money. WIll keep updating further progress if they would care to attend the service request complaint or not."
Better than Boult,5.0,Better in price range of 1399 best for use microphone quality is like wired headphone not only good for hearing music but also for talking with ur love ones at night.. best in all ur budget is under 1500 if ur budget is 4000 then go true wireless but in that u will miss the microphone quality u have to speak louder good for daily use bass is not best but okay type in this price range of wireless headphone neon and black colour is good all the three colours look awesome noise cancellation is not that much it fit properly u can use for gym heavy workout but due to neckband its little heavier and feeling of wired around neck as this is Bluetooth headset then not that much long lasting coz u have to charge the battery and one day after one year may the battery get damaged don't charge is frequently once its less than 20% than only charge this headphone battery backup of continues use in starting is 4 to 5hrs and at standby mode u can use it for 2days.. once u get this u will forget ur phone as whenever call will come u Don't have to run just use ur connected headset to receive the call . U can also pair smart watch and this headset together
No regrets,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I was very apprehensive about buying  wireless earphones but i decided to buy it in the sale anyway. I have no regrets because it is a good investment. The sound quality is good, so is the mic. I use it for online classes, so i like it. The colour is very unique as well. UNLIKE what many people said here that the ear support hurts, i believe otherwise.  It only makes it more sturdy, i can workout with them without the dear of it falling off.  ALSO different sizes of earbuds are available in package. 5/5 do buy!"
Good product as per price,4.0,This is not my first Rockerz 255Pro. Basically I bought 2 of them and it's been more than 6 months from then I'm using these.Below are the points that I noticed during the usage and I hope they will help you in buying:1. Design:Overall design is good and you can wear them whole day if you can avoid that shark fin holdersüòÖButton position is also good and easy to operate.2. Battery lifeWhile you are connected to phone either you are using the Neckband or not. It consumes some power continuously and last for 9-10 hours.3. Noise isolationI use earphones generally while traveling. I found that I have to increase the volume to maximum while in Metro. And this is not great because listing to full volume for a long time can damage your ears.4. ChargingIt does support the fast charging. You can enjoy your Neckband again after 1.5hours of full charging.5.cVc technologyThis technology is used for making clear voice calls while you are in a crowded area. It works pretty well but if the noices are too much it wouldn't help you either.6. Sound qualityMusic I'm getting over it good. Thumping bass is not available but yes good overall.Treble level is good so the vocals and high frequencies can be listen greatly.Don't expect same sound quality in traffic area as noise isolation is not great that much.Overall it is a good product and that's why rated 3 starts.Hope it will help you üòáCheers!
Don't buy,1.0,Just one month nd gone. Product sucks. Please don't buy. Not finding at service centres as well.
Doesn't do what it is made for.,2.0,"Bought this 4 months back.Pros- good sound, nice battery back, very light on neck.  Good only for listening to musicCons - really bad for using it for its actual purpose. It has got no noise cancellation hence people will nt be able to hear you clearly.My advice avoid buying it as you can't return it"
Seller should give right material...,1.0,Bass lovers .........Will love this. Boat rockerz is truly for bass lovers with wireless it's giving tremendous sound quality........ Go for it.....Giving 4 star only for delivering used headphone to me getting replacement this week...... Otherwise this is better wireless than sony and senhiser which are more costlier than this.....If don't want to spend more than just go for it. Will update as I will receive new one and tell you about build quality and looks....Also share pics. Replacement is faulty and seller is not giving me replacement of  headphone again so returning the same.
"Good for both mobile and Teams, Skype call using Laptop.",5.0,"Writing this review after 1 week of use. I ordered this during lockdown period and Amazon delivered it on time with proper packing. Coming to the Rockerz 255 Pro headphone, this really work as it suppose to. I have all my Laptop and mobile having BT v 4.x and this this BT v5 headphone work perfectly. It will connect to the device immediately you switch it on. I use this for all my Teams and skype calls from office (WFH) along with mobile call during office time and this works perfectly. simultaneously it can connect with with one laptop and one mobile. Battery backup is also sufficient. really good purchase at this price range."
Never buy a boat earphone.,1.0,I buyed the product and it stopped working after 2 months.The after sale service of boat is very bad and pathetic .
Very poor after sale service,1.0,Headphone is average but most important thing in todays era is after sale service on this side this brand is pathetic dont go for it at all.I have used other headphone brands in past but never have faced such ridiculous service.I have given my boat headphone around 2month back fr issue related to one side not working...which is usual as sometime it happens....but till now i have not got my device back yet after several mails on diffrnt customore care boat mail id. I think this brand is just focusing on selling but not on after sale service which is very crucial. Brands in todays date are so much concern on after sale service as am using other diffrnt..So pls dnt go fr this brand...i would suggest go for any branded company which is more committed.
Heard up while charging and damaged the headset,1.0,"Good for a few weeks. After that the battery heated up drastically, and melted the rubber buttons. I luckily stopped charging in time, else may have even caught fire. Now the buttons are fused and the product can't be used.Hope Amazon will promptly replace the defective product."
MADE IN CHINA - Please Avoid,1.0,The headphone is ok..but it is running our country out of business...Go for local or Go for Sony ;-)
Best in the budget,4.0,"I'm always a boat fan. Rockerz 255 Pro Plus is an upgraded version of Rockerz 255 and 255 Pro. Sound quality is good. Bass is pretty well more than 40% volume, below 40% isn't that encouraging. Battery life is an exceptional feature. I can say it's amazing in this segment. This is the 10th day of mine and the battery is standing at 60% after a everyday usage of 8 to 9 hours continously with a volume level of 30 - 40 percent (I won't hear more than this level and I advice others also not to exceed with 50% as it may have a long term consequences on your ears). Best in the budget and teal green colour is bright and attractive. Overall, a good steal at this price range. Deducting one star for bad packaging."
very good product,5.0,"I tried 3 bluetooth headsets (Samsung Level U which is not so durable, 2 of JBL) and boat rockerz255 is the best pick i must say considering the pricing (bought is for 999, i know you can get it at even better price sometimes). Steady, Durable and Decent Quality of music. Recommended for Bikers, Cyclists, who want decent music and wireless headsets. Someone like music geek or who is looking for bass, amazing music this may not be good pick though. ""Thank You Boat"", you are one among few Indian companies which has flourished in recent past, please continue making good products and make us feel proud."
"Best for the price, can't expect more.",4.0,"I purchased this product for 999/- and received it one day (Thanks to Amazon). I am going to split the review about this product into PROS and CONS.PROS:1). Sound quality - As i am a bass lover, I have satisfied with the sound stage of this device. Lows and mids are clear with an adequate amount of bass.2). Build quality - Build quality of the product is exceptionally great for this price and it has two magnets which holds the ear pieces in place.3). Sweat proof - Suitable for gym freaks. It can easily withstand the splashes and sweat since it has IP rating.4). Battery life - This product can last for 6 to 8 hours depending on your usage. Charging time takes around 45 minutes to reach 100%CONS:1). Connectivity - Bluetooth range is not that great. After moving 5 meters away from the device, the connectivity gets lost. So, mostly make sure that you carry your mobile along with you and the battery information about the device is not appropriate. Some times it shows 80% in my device and all of a sudden it indicates 20% battery remaining.2). Tactility - Buttons on this headphones are not that easy to press. It needs some hard presses which sometimes feel irritated.So, if you are a good bass lover and looking for a good wireless earphones at an affordable price then this should be your choice probably."
Just Buy don't Think so Much Because It's BoAt.,5.0,"Superb sound quality... Nice build ... I was using Rockerz 255f, Rockerz 235v2, Rockerz 400 and a Bluetooth Speaker Stone 1000 previously they all were superb and amazing Bass now this time I bought Rockerz 255pro+  only for Battery life ... It's 40 hours guys can you imagine... Superb Work BoAt. Love you.. Thanks Amazon for giving some discount I want to it at 1000 rupees in offer day but bought it for 1299 rupees... No Regrets at all... Don't see Negative comments go for it.. later you will Thank Me. Have A Good Day Stay Home andStay Safe.@ Athar"
Mike dead within a month,1.0,"Edit: Mike stopped working after 20 days, so cannot use it for calls anymore. The return window has also closed. DO NOT BUY.Since I don't use it for music, this review is about all the OTHER aspects of it. Overall, not a bad purchase if you're a non-fussy buyer who just wants a bluetooth headset that works, needs it for clocking less than 6 hours of use per day and doesn't care about how it looks.What I liked:1. It's light and comfortable to wear.2. Sounds are clear while on call or playing videos.3. Can stay connected and alternate between two devices at a time, so I don't have to repeat the pairing process between my laptop and phone.What I did not like:1. I got the ocean blue one which looked shiny and bright in the product ad, but the colour is actually a dull matte light blue.2. Bluetooth range is less than 10 metres3. Active playback time is only 6 hours after 1.5 hours of charging.4. The ear guide is not comfortable for long periods, but the earphones also keep falling out of the ear when guides are removed.5. Looks cheap. Plastic buttons have rough edges and wires are not smooth.6. Wires are too long, hanging all the way to the tummy when not in use. There is no provision to adjust cord length."
Value for money,1.0,after using it for 4 weeks it has stopped working very disappointed. After service of this product is also horrible i will defiantly not recommend this product horrible horrible experience all the money gone into waste:(never recommending your company to any one you guys are worst for sure
Bang for the buck.,5.0,"This is my 2 set of boat rockers 255 . It's one of the best Bluetooth earphones you can buy for 1000 bucks . The sound quality is Great . Battery back up is ok works for 6 hours only on a single change . The Bluetooth connectvity is strong , does face some issues at time it happens once in 20 days may be but works fine . The battery indicator on the phone shows incorrect battery life it's drains  perfectly from 100% to 50 % after which the battery goes dead . However I don't feel that's any issue . Coz it's works exactly 6 hours as advertised on the box . Noice cancelation is okok  you are still able to hear outside sounds. overall Great product ."
Bass+sound+noice cancellation is perfect.,4.0,Overall ratings iv given 4 as i dnt liked the design. Too lengthy i feel(boat should givr wire length adjuster as in other models it has provided). Though bass noice cancellation and sound clearity is perfect. I am comparing this product with lenovo he05. Bass and noice cancellation is best than lenovo he05. I ride bike with mic being near neck i wore 2masks with helmet still person can hear my voice. For this and bass its perfect only design i dnt liked so i Returned the product. Remember that i hav compared it to lower cost product if u compare it with jbl n others the response might be different. If you are confused refer the ratings for the products and your should not be dissatisfied.Thanks.
"Too good in this price... Am so happy,üòÉüòä",5.0,"** the product was a perfect purchase... but it is not charging, requested for replacement..Replacement is quick and so prominent... Thank You boAt team...Pros:‚Ä¢Soft feeling wearing this ""boAT Rockerze"" and look also good..‚Ä¢The sound quality is excellent, it's like a premium brands...‚Ä¢I am using just after receiving the product without charging and it is going on and on.

NOT GREAT but GOOD !,4.0,"I ‚Äòm reviewing this product after a week of rigorous use. And oh boy! I am impressed.NOTE ‚Äì I purchased this BT Neckband at Rs.1099/- during SALE !>> DON‚ÄôT EXPECT SONY/BOSE LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE + QUALITY FROM THIS CHEAP BT NECKBAND, BUT IT IS GOOD, LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT.(1) Battery backup is good. I got almost 6 hrs backup on constant use.(2) BT 5.0 is awesome. Connectivity with Mobile is smooth & constant even at 25 ft (Tested). 3) It‚Äôs absolutely Featherweight & offers NO RESISTANCE in the neck region. Comfortable to use.(4) 1 YEAR WARRANTY on an under 1500 rupees electronic item is a novelty!(5)  It ain't a Ferrari but a Jaguar. You can live with it.Happy Shopping Amazonians"
Excellent product must buy,5.0,"40 hours of unreal battery backup at 50% volume.I charge once in 5 days. I hear songs, receive calls no complaints from receiver on surrounding noise or wind gushing.If you are about to buy this, note to you:If I use it for 2-3 hours per day in full volume it gives 3 days of battery backup. You can't expect 40 hours of backup.It needs to be turned off by holding pause/play button for 3-5 secs.If you forget to turn off the device, then you can't enjoy the battery backup.Charge with a 5V adapter for better charging experience. If you use turbo charger or fast charge adaptor, it may drain your device's lifetime (check with well-known sources, I may be wrong)."
Sound quality decent but connectivity issues,2.0,"I have further reduced it to 2 stars as there is connectivity issues. While listening to music it suddenly disconnects and connects .... Sometimes it does not connect at all ...  then i have to re-pair the device as a new deviceThe first product i received did not have the mic wokring and the sound quality was very bad especially in one year the sound was higher than the other one. The replacement i got is working fine. The only problem i notice is when i am walking the connectivity seems to be patchy. The song starts breaking up but after sometime it's ok. I notice this when i go for more than an hour of walking. I have both the boat and realme earphone both have their advantages, personally i like the realme slightly more than boat"
Very Good Sound Quality with unreliable performance and poor built quality.,2.0,"I bought this Bluetooth earphones in August 2020 for my wife. I already have Boat Rockerz 255 (Old Model) which I have been using since 2019. My observations are as below. Rockerz 255 Pro are not as reliable as Rockerz 255. It's Battery life is pathetic and most of the time, if the battery percentage is around 40 %, earphones may start also.Many a times, We have to put them for charging to start the earphones.Last but not the least, built quality of these earphones is not as sturdy as older model. I am not sure whether battery of my earphones has got swollen within one year itself but my battery compartment has become so loose now that upper cover falls down and battery gets exposed with a slight jerk while jogging. Thinking of using my Warranty to get them replaced for Manufacturing issues with Battery and design."
Best quality for the price,5.0,"Really like the base and sound quality for this price. It's good to listen to music. I have a Bose 300 QC but I'm using this on a day to day basis as carrying QC wherever I go is not practical. I going this headphone is  quite enough for my music need . The microphone is working as expected.The only issue is that the headphone doesnt announce the battery percentage. However my OnePlus 6t shows headphone battery when connected. The headphone give the annoying message ""battery is low"" from 20% onwards."
Not an attractive product. usage tells the truth.,2.0,"sound is good. But!-long wire hanging in the neck which is disturbing-ear getting pain for long use. just more than an 1hr- multi-function is waste - it is not moving to next song - very irritation when driving. need to take phone out to move next song!- when I double click on the center button. it is initiating a call to the last dialer from my android phone, not sure this is only to me. but works good in iphone.Anyway returning the items!"
Bass lovers will enjoy.,4.0,"I have been using the product for over 15 days. Below mentioned are the Pros and Cons:PROS:1) Satisfying bass quality.2) Sound is loud. I feel 70% volume is the sweetspot where you get the best of both worlds (Bass & Treble)3) Enormous battery life. Easily get 35+ hours of music on single charge.4) Distortion free music at high loudness.5) Superb connectivity.6) No lag or latency in watching YouTube videos.CONS:1) Vocals sometimes seems muddled and the crispiness is missing.2) Neckband is ok, but the wires could have been more sturdier. Although the wires are flat.3) Visible lag/latency while playing PUBG."
Detailed Review,4.0,"Pros:charge time 2 hrs and backup is very good full day use (6 hr continuous)two led colors red and blue . while using blue light blinks after every few secs,in-build ringtone (trrrin trrrin type).using in honor 6x show battery icon in 100-80-50-25-0 stages.Gives warning on low battery and when connected or disconnected (human voice).Lightwight,good build quality.i replaced rubber earplugs with piston earphone plugs, the 3 pairs comes with package are not too soft but are fine.you can control volume of pc and mobile depends on which device is currently playing.i am using piston onemore ,music quality is not to that level but is pretty decent. bass is balancedcons:Range is 10m in real world plays well if u are in room , the moment you walk out of room then distortion occurs.mic is very sensitive and works fine so far no complains from other end. i have not used outside the room.when it keep it for charging it gets switch off on it own then have to reconnect it again (not a big issue) ....first i had doubt on it battery,sound quality,mic quality but after using it i am happy even though i have used one more ,boat 255,mi earphone 399 , Samsung earphone, Phillips 249 etc."
üëéüëé Disappointed! Stopped working in 4 months!,2.0,"I'm writing this review after using these earphones for quite sometime. I don't use earphones regularly and I keep them very safe. First of all, it stopped working all of a sudden in like 4 months, it neither started on clicking the power button nor charged up. Secondly, the battery time was horrible, even after full charge it barely worked for 3 hours. Regarding the sound, it was average just like any other earphone so I was sort of okay with it, though noise cancellation did not work. (Bass was a bit better) Even the customer service is quite frustrating and I couldn't get my replace till now even after so many days of complaint.Overall I would say it's an overhyped product, price wise okay but then it's better to invest in a quality product than just changing it often."
A decent set of Bluetooth headphones,5.0,"I wanted a set of Bluetooth headphones that I can use at work, as well as while exercising. I have found it to be quite decent.Pros:* Can connect to 2 devices at the same time.* The ear bud provide good sound isolation, and reduce background noise to a large extent.* The microphone is quite good, and none of the people I spoke on the phone with, could recognize that I was on a heaset.* The earbuds don't come out, no matter how much I shake my head, or move around. (Important while exercising)* They are light and comfortable enough to wear while sleeping, and having your head on the side.Cons:* If you wear it while running/jogging, the neckband keeps jumping. Would have loved some magnetic clasp on the neck which would prevent it from jumping out.* When the battery is down, it just gives a warning and shuts down; Would have loved it, if it could have a warning at say 20%, so that you can decide what to do after that."
Disappointed - right side headphone has lost its sound after a few months,1.0,The battery lasts approximately 4 hours if continuously used. The sound quality is good. Noise cancellation is okie. The neck band is flexible which is exactly what I wanted. I roll the headphones easily to put them in a case. The wire is very flexible and good quality.Overall a good product. BUT.....16/10/2019 Dowgraded the rating after few months of use...the right side headphone volume has automatically reduced. Can hardly hear anything in right side unless volume is turned on full. Disappointed with this defect.
Amazing Bluetooth earphones.,5.0,"One of best earphones at this price. Got it for only 1074 rs. Bass is amazing, vocals are nice. Loudness is excellent. Build quality is below average, sometimes feel very cheap, but acceptable at this price. Mic quality is not very good, sounds pretty low on mic. Battery life is outstanding no doubt. there's no aptX support on this earphones, only 2 codec support on this earphones, SBC & AAC. so don't be fool, but AAC works fine. Overall great wireless neckband in this budget range. Thank you #boAt & #AmazonEdit- my first unit has some problems, now they replaced with new earphones, for as of now there's no problem in this unit. thank you Amazon for super fast delivery with great packaging. really appreciate for that. ü•∞"
Not suitable for office calls or work,2.0,"It could be good for only listening the songs but not for office calls.It has many draw back, continuous big sound inbuild sound for connected , disconnected rocker information irritated.Batter is okay okay, could not expect for whole day if have daily uses.Bad big not controlable system inbuild voice is the main reason I hate this product, It disturb while in the call or anytime when you are in inportant discussion."
Please buy at your own risk,1.0,"I received this item on 16 February 2021 and this review was written on 17 February 2021. If you are shopping for sports activities, please do not shop. It often comes out of your ears, although on the first day of its testing some hoarse sound starts coming from the left side and it is very annoying so I have processed the return but customer care is saying that this item only comes in Replacement. Now I don't know what to do."
"Pains in the ear, and always a damaged box",3.0,"Bought this for gifting purpose for a friend. Came ultra damaged first time. The Box was fully crushed. Returned.Got the replacement item, it was again all crushed. Looked like someone has thrown this a 100 times. Thought to give it a try, but the structure of the ear plugs is not good. Specially the extra rubber which is there to hold in place. Within 10 mins, your mind goes from music to 'whats pocking in my ears'.Overall, a bad experience.Built quality : 8/10Sound quality : 7/10 (if you are a Sennheiser user)Battery life : 9/10overall for the price : 8.5/10Edit: Had gifted one to a friend just 2 months back, and its not working on one side now. Raised a warranty claim with BOAT, and they said would replace it with a new one at no extra cost. But, this may take 20-30 days."
Good option for higher battery backup requirements only,4.0,"I got this 255 pro + for its excellent battery backup. I had read the reviews saying excellent sound quality and deep base, but to my surprise it was not that good for sound quality.  Bass is just so so and feels like a normal speaker feeling rather than very deep , low end bass and somehow I felt these to be treble heavy tuning. I also have Infinity Glide 120 which gives way better bass and sound quality for same price but battery backup is much lesser than 255 pro +. Wish it also had some kind of dual sound profile like Infinity ones.voice quality is good and decent amount of noise cancellation but its not active noise cancellation at all. This thing got only one mic, so hard to believe that it supports any form of ANC. But suitable for day to day usage. Didn‚Äôt get that hissing sound that others reported.Quality of material is OK but not much flexible so we have to keep them around neck all the time and can‚Äôt really put them in pocket. The main connection band is kind of hard flexible plastic rather than soft silicone material like other brands.One of the good point I like about this model is that the remote and mic part is separate and hangs near to our mouth so handling the controls and voice reception is much better as others can hear us clearly what we are saying and don't have to raise our voice.Also the teal green color looks cool.Verdict: If you want BT neckband for daily calls and travel most time so need better battery backup, then you can consider itBut if you also need decently good sound quality, then there are better options available.In my personal use, I liked Infinity Glide 120 with 12 mm drivers and dual equaliser profile to be way better than these."
Good at it's price.,4.0,"I bought these earphones on 23 March. My experience with these headphones is quite great. I got delivery on time, packing was great and sealed. So talking about functioning- it comes with the sound quality you will love. Bass is good enough to make your toes move. Mic is of good quality, Noise cancellation could have been even better but I think thats great for this price range. Works with dual phone and for for about 7-8m radius. Battery backup is good. Though it has 10 min charge system, full battery charging takes time. Buttons are working well. Build quality is superb. In short you can go for it if you are thinking to buy it."
Garbage product,2.0,"As the headline tells, its garbage and it ends up where it belongs; the bin. It is just beyond understanding how product like these keep on selling and end up as recommended ones for a buyer.The first ones I received stopped working withing two weeks of usage. So, returned them and received a new one and they stopped working as well within its first month. Sound quality was just average, the effort for the brand it seems is just to make profits and nothing else.Any advice I can give is start making products after trying and proper testing. If you have the numbers for selling to why not make products exciting. I first got boat made products around 2017 and it feels like they have just made their way only down the road over this time."
Serves the purpose,4.0,This is an average bluetooth headset and serves the purpose. And justifies the cost. Many of the music components are unvalued and heigher frequency sounds quality are suffering. Most focus on 20 HZ to 500HZ I guess.But if you are music lover and and can't compromise with the quality the spend bit extra please better do it or go for. I used Sennheiser for five years and dropping to this headset is kind of shocking and learning to adjust.
Good purchase for 850rs,5.0,"The product is really good, very much durable, 1500rs price will be best buy, but bit overpriced because of high demand...i have got it for 850rs via sale.Pros: more than good sound quality, not excellent, voice is crisp and clearExecellent build qualityLooks stylishEarphone fits very properly and do not hurt ears during long usageHave magnetic lockCan use for calls, as it provides good sound receptionBattery life is 6hrs as describedCharging time is 45min to 1hr to full charge on normal charger(not with charger give in packet)Good bassCons:Charging percentage is not seen, can be visible kf connected only in bars(percentage not seen)Sound could have been excellentOther person can listen the background noise as noise cancellation does not work properlyNo charger provided, with usb it is slow to chargeOverall a good buy, satisfied with outcomeThanks to Amazon for faster delivery and flash sale of diwali"
Below average,1.0,"Although I like the sound quality and noise cancelling, I'm one the mix between the bass quality, sometimes it can be a bit too much.. this is coming from someone who likes a lot of bass; but I like it noneless while some might not. My main gibe is the quality and the price of the profit. The product breaks down barely 1 and a half month of usage - The right side is the first to go out and gradually it all went on a downward spiral from there. Considering the price, I wouldn't recommend anyone to pay for an earphone that breaks down within 2 month for that price tag. I'd recommend something from Sennheiser, JBL, Sony or Samsung etc. or if you're looking for a morr appropriate and withing the same same price range, I'd recommend pTron, Realme or amazon essentials. All in all, go for another earphones cuz in a month, you might eventually have to buy another if you bought this one."
Decently performing short term purchase,3.0,"First of all this is a cheap, plastic Chinese mass manufactured device. IT WILL NOT HAVE A LONG LIFE. The price reflects the quality exactly. Expect it to stop functioning after a year or less.PROS:Good sound. Had a blast listening to videos on youtube, music and works well with gaming too.Passive noise cancellation is good. Filters out a good degree of ambient noise.Charging port compatible with standard Android USB mini smartphone charger cablesCONS:Not very comfortable to wear. The band is hard and hangs down putting strain on your ears. Will be especially painful to wear during exercise. Not sure why they couldn't design this section as ordinary wire.Poor battery life. This is advertised as 6 hrs but it was only 4-5 hours for me.Not waterproof as advertised. There are manufacturing defects with tiny holes in the buds at least in my purchase which will let in sweat and water."
Warrenrt service and customer service is fake and cheap and frustrating really uneducated staff.,1.0,The product is not good it  it's not even worked for 7 months and when I tried to go to service center they doesnt have that product available on there end it's been 2 months I have visited them 5 times but they don't have product available. Boat service is very cheap and the staff which works in service center are uneducated they say come next week come next week and it's almost 2 mobths I am visiting them for my product warranty and complaint. Also there online option for registeribg complaint it's even not working. Boat is really cheap in customer support. Don't go for any boat products in life if you need good customer service
Boat always make things superb for Mid rangersüòä,5.0,Purchased in sale worth Rs 999 so it was Great deal and all things like battery backup to sound quality is Great and superb in this price range.Best waepon for gym warriors.Just charge for half an hour and play upto 6 hours.Sometime when have a call its lagging like breaking voice but overall nice noice cancellation.Apart from all great deal in  Rs 999 earphones with Bluetooth and the button controls.
Crap product from a nice brand - Don't waste money,1.0,"I have been using different boat 255 headsets over an year now without any issues. But, this headset - Boat Rockerz 255 Pro+ is a crap. I have ordered this headset on Feb 12th 2021. First week itself I noticed it keep disconnecting from the phone.  Next week it is not powering on itself. Claimed warranty and after waiting for 10 days, replacement product came. One week it worked well then it is not powering on !!! Again I submitted complaint on April 29. They picked the product and updated that it got delivered to service center on May 7th. Then no further update. Please do not waste your time and money on this headset as it is not worth it."
Delivers deep and clear beats!,3.0,"October 5, 2020: First impressions‚ñ∫ The device did not power on; made me think it might have been shipped without any charge in its battery. I charged it for ten minutes and was then able to power it on. Once connected to my phone, it said the battery was at 80%. That was a bit confusing.‚ñ∫ I played‚Üí soft piano music‚Üí ghazals‚Üí old and recent Bollywood songs‚Üí techno, pop, and jazz‚Üí debates and mushaira.The device performs quite well. The bass is good as advertised, music and voice are clear. I am satisfied.‚ñ∫ I have not yet tried voice calls with the device. I don't spend much time on phone calls, so the call quality does not matter to me much.‚ñ∫Looks and build are OK.‚ñ∫ Earbuds are soft and well-fitting. However, that does not mean they will feel comfortable for everyone. The same is true with all wearable devices.‚ñ∫THE ONLY THING I HATE SO FAR: The annoying pre-recorded message you hear in a loud male voice upon powering on, connecting and power off the device. Quite annoying. Check out what it says:When you power on the earphones: ""Power on! You have plugged into Nirvana. Your device is ready to pair.""When you connect to a phone or laptop: ""You're now connected to Rocerz 255 Pro!When you post off: ""Adios, amigo! Powering off.""Trust me, you will feel irritated listening to all that every time.Before buying BoAt Rockerz 255 Pro, I considered One Plus Bullets Z, Realme Buds, Lenovo HE15, and Boult Audio ProBass. I verified the accuracy of reviews for all these devices and checked for the possible deception involved. I found that the reviews for BoAt Rockerz 255 Pro were much more reliable. (You can use FakeSpot for verifying the authenticity of the reviews)"
Quality of the sound is really awesome. But the company also must look at it's build quality.,4.0,Nice product. I love it's sound and bass. I purchased for me and another two for my family members after I make sure for it's sound quality. But one thing I really concerned here about it build quality. Mine replaced for two times till now for it's power button issue. It will take 20 days to replace the product. First time after 20 days of purchaseing and then after three months. Now they clame this new replacement is a good one. Let's see how many days it will again goes.
Go fot it,5.0,Great product earlier I have been using tws but after having used many brand even oneplus there is many bad things on tws if compared to these neck twsfirstly there fit may not be for every one and they will keep falling from your ears as I have experienced on oneplus secondly there battery backup is not even comparable to these ones andAnd lastly there microphone is not great for callingThese I have bought roughly one month ago and have been haapy with my puschase I had a bike road trip for one week stay and 190 km I have used these for all 7 days and these came back with 70 %battery left and sound is also good check some YouTube videos on thisAnd buy it you will lovw these
Phenomenal battery life,5.0,I can vouch for this headphone‚Äôs phenomenal battery life. It easily last 35-40 hours which is industry leading. Blindly go for this headphone and don‚Äôt even look elsewhere.Only I minor designing flaw which the Boat team has surely failed to notice is when you wear the headphone the volume up (+) button is placed down while the volume down (-) button comes up. It should be vice-versa. But you get used to it. Not a deal breaker.
"Mediocre quality, overpriced",2.0,"Pros:1. Magnificient battery life2. Latency while gaming is lower than other earphones at a similar price bracket.Cons:1. Hissing noise in the background.2. Does NOT support Qualcomm aptX. Defaults to AAC codec in my oneplus device.3. Call quality is not very good.4. Should not be priced more than Rs. 900.Verdict: If you want a good Bluetooth headphone, spend some more money and get a better one. Or stick to wired earphones in this price bracket. To get a decent quality wireless earphones, you have to spend Rs 4k-5k at least. The problem is not with Boat but every companies who sells Bluetooth earphones at this price point. I have tried oppo enco, realme buds, oneplus z, even sony and jbl. But each and every wireless  earphones sold in Rs 1k-2.5k price bracket is total crap."
Pretty good üëç,5.0,"Value for money service is what I'd say first. I bought this for my husband for ease of attending calls while driving etc. Along with a smart watch so the only qualities I was looking for were if it could capture voice clearly, is comfortable for long time wearing, battery backup and sound quality. I'd say I'm happy with all those. With the magnet, it's easy to just pick the right side up and use it only when there is a call and take it off and leave it and it'll stick automatically once done with the call. Earbuds are comfortable. It captures his sound way better than any Bluetooth earpod or earphone he has had yet. The sound quality coming in is also excellent and battery backup is AMAZING so I'm happy with it üëç go for it if you are also looking for these qualities. Also the colours are pretty fun too üòâ"
Good for me...,4.0,"Hello There,I have got it for 1500/- INR, Honestly sharing, this is really good for me. I am sharing my personal experience of using them. I have used it at Home (Movies, songs), Gym (Rap, Gym music), Car Driving (Nusrat Khan).Pros:Good sound and good base (I don't use Sony so please don't judge)Loud sound, I used only at 80% sound volume and that is enoughClear soundLatency- almost no latency while movies, I like it!easy to pair,good connectivity with laptop and mobilestays in neck while joggingDuring gym - workout it good and don't come out off ears, but yes during bench press you may hear low baseCons: hard to find any so far my experience is concernfor the money i have invested and got this for 40 hrs playback time, the battery never goes out.Recommendation: You must have this in your neck, worth spending on this..I will come here again to share my long term review."
Just go for it,5.0,Awesome best budget wireless earphones
"Value for Money, for Bass lovers. Good connectivity.",4.0,"I love these Earphones.My battery lasted from morning 6:40 am to 11pm where it was continuously connected to my smartphone. I used it for calls and for1 hour for music in this time period.There's a lot of Bass. This can be levelled with your smart phone's inbuilt equalizer, but it will be a pain if you are using multiple music players or video players.The build quality is good w.r.t. the price. I bought it for Rs. 1399/-.Bluetooth pairing is very fast. No hazzles.It can be used for all activities but not voice recording. So if anyone is looking out for recording audio with this device then this is not at all what you are looking for."
Poor Product,1.0,"I bought this product on March 7.  I am not very satisfied with this product.The sound quality is ok not great. but at this price, I cannot complain.It is comfortable to wear for a long period of time.It also has auto power off functionality.  So, battery drain isn't a lot.So, overall when it works it works decently and is good buy for the priceHowever, after about a month of use, it has stopped working properly.  When I power off the headset, the indicator light doesn't switch off.  Hence, the battery drains slowly and in a few hours even if it is switched off the piece is dead.  The dissappoiting aspect is that this has broken in just about a month.  So, really cheap.And getting it serviced is tough because I need walk into the service center to get it done.  No replacement policy. Overall, really unhappy with the purchase. Unlikely to buy boAt again."
A short term review.,4.0,"Well itz a very good bluetooth earphone for the price u pay. Sound quality is very good but after using the earphone for prolonged period i.e. an hour or so, your ears begin to ache a little bit. The buds are not ergonomically designed like other boat wired earphones. These are straight tip earbuds no angle to given to them and also the metallic part of the buds is a bit bigger in diameter which is the source of aches i guess. Overall a very good set of bluetooth earphones."
"Good One, right choice",5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I received it Today, Boat 255 pro +, Boat is a reliable brand, I do hv other Boat products n they r working fine no complaints so far, it's been good 3 years I hv been using them. I expect same from dis neck band, used it a while ago, sound quality loud enough, enhanced bass, comfortable in ear. Alexa, Google Asst works well. It's basically easy to operate, quick bluetooth connectivity. No issues so far. I think I hv already adapted myself to dis New, neck band wear. Thnx Amazon."
"Superb earphones, must buy this.",5.0,"I am writing this review after using it for 1 week.1) Battery Backup: For battery backup I would say it is the best earphone in its class. I charged it only once on the day of received and didn't charge. I am using it more than 1 week continuesoly, 5-6 hours daily in music and phone conversation and it has still 60% battery. I would highly recommend it for long lasting battery backup.2) Charging Time: It took 1 hour to get complete charge and as per my usage experience, it seems true that if you charge it for 10 monutes it would give 10 hours battery backup. It has type C charging port and type C cable in the box.3) Call clarity: It is giving optimum performance while talking. It supress almost 70-80% background noice while you talking means the other person can hear your voice very clearly and you can hear him/her very clear.4) Cotrols and Mic position: It has 3 control buttons. Its Mic is built in within the the wire in cotrol panel which makes it more near to your mouth. Which grasp very clear voice while talking.5) Comfort: It is very light weight and very comfortable to wear within ears and around your neck. You can easily wear it while running or in work out or commuting.6) Water resistant: It has IPX7 certificate which means you do not need to worry about water splash or sweat.7) Sound quality: It has 10 mm sound driver. It is modified to give optimum bass quality for music. I am loving while listening songs or waching movies. Superb sound and bass quality.Conclusion: But it and stay tension free. You will love this product."
"Decent sound quality, heavy bass",4.0,"I've used these for about 1.5 years without any issues. And after that they stopped working due to internal wire breakage. Here's what my experience was:Battery backup is ok, it could have been better. Lasts for about 6hrs on heavy usage. You need to charge atleast for 15 mins before your day is over as the battery may drain when you are on an important call at the end of the day, which is frustrating. Sound quality is good I should say. Bass is heavy, but lacks quality. It even boosts bass even when not necessary. Build quality is good. I hate the microphone quality on these. People often complain me about my voice being very low during calls while using these earphones. Well balanced earphones in the price range."
FAKE PRODUCT ALERT ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è,1.0,"Fake product given by Appario retail private limited, i have ordered ""BOAT"" rockerz 255pro plus but i received the 1st copy of the product because the main USP of the product is Qualcomm aptx codec and cVc noise cancellation, which also have written on the back side of the box , but in my case boat surrounding signature sound and passive noise cancellation written which is similar to 'BOAT' rockerz 255, AND I PAID 1499 FOR FAKE PRODUCT.. AMAZON AND BOAT SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS.. But for sure i am never ever gonna buy Boat product, and will never recommend Boat to other..."
"Too much bass, though adjustable with equalizer. Good calling & excellent battery.",5.0,"I purchased it at Rs. 1299, for the purpose of daily office meetings and some music.I like balanced sound, but it has boosted bass suitable for bass-music lovers.For the first 3 days, I felt the audio was disgusting with too much bass. Later I installed equalizer APO in my PC and attenuated the frequencies lower than 400 Hz (which carry bass). Now, the sound is balanced with a good treble. In fact, awesome!Regarding call quality: It has no issues with that. Good noice cancellation.Battery backup is gigantic. If I start it on Monday, I need to charge it on the weekend only. Easily lasts 35 hours. So, need to care to turn off repeatedly throughout the day.Go for it without any doubt."
Good headset,5.0,"I received the headset in good condition.  No breakage was noticed by me after the shipment arrived. Its sound quality is good. It work whole day with normal.usage which include day long connectivity with phone for calls and 1-2 hours of music listening.But, its not suitable for running, as the stopper of the ear bud are not ergonomically suited for running. Its good for walk amd normal usage.Another problem which i noticed was very seldom bluetooth connectivity issue."
Look elsewhere if you want to use it primarily for calls,3.0,"I don‚Äôt hate these earphones but I don‚Äôt love them either.Pros:Audio quality is decentnoise cancellation is pretty good considering it‚Äôs not ANC.Cons: mic‚ÄîI still can‚Äôt figure out where it‚Äôs placed so calls become very frustrating as the person on the other end can‚Äôt hear me very well. My primary use for this is for long calls/video calls on the phone so this is very annoying.Auto shut down‚Äîas long as you‚Äôre paired with a device, it won‚Äôt shut down after a time of inactivity. So I regularly fall asleep with it still paired (but not playing music) and will have just 20% battery in the morning."
Affordable but lots of technical issues,2.0,"Changing my review after 2 months usage.This is an affordable wireless headset but it's only good for listening to music/video/books, etc.Issues:1. Sometimes you can't hear the other person on a phone call.2. While playing a game with mic, the game audio will be quieter and very low quality and also the voice quality will be very low. I never faced this issue with wired headsets.3. It will disconnect on it's own sometimes even though battery is still there.All in all, if you want somethint which you can use while you're doing some physical activity this is good but for anything else you want to do at a leisurely pace, this is not good."
What's not there to like?,5.0,"Ok I've been using these magnificent neckbands from 2 days.And what's there not to be liked ..All pros1.battery back up just excellent2.sound quality best under 2000rs3.comfortable as hell4.bass is sufficient, you need more bass than these have then you got a serious problem üòÇSeen people complaint about bass (tip: just change the buds according to your ears)5.highs, lows, middles are upto the mark6.treble is also goodYou can totally enjoy every bit of your music on those 255 pro plus.And the best part it's just 1500rs you won't get any such thing In such a low price .So, if you are thinking of buying it just go for it.‚òÆÔ∏è peace"
"Excellent battery life, great sound quality",5.0,"I've been using the headset for more than a week now, and haven't had to recharge them even once. They came fully charged and are still at 50% battery. These are in-ear headphones, so sound isolation is quite high once the ear buds are inserted properly. So far, I haven't heard a single complaint from anyone on the other side about any noise or unclear voice, even when I am sitting in a moderately noisy work environment. Sound quality is good, along with bass. If you find a sync issue with video, pause or rewind the video for a couple of seconds and it will sync fine."
"Good sound quality, instant connectivity,  battery life and charging speed.",5.0,"Boats rockers 255 pro+ is a good product with excellent connectivity, sound quality and battery life. Charging via laptop using the c type cable provided took around 2hrs from 10% to 100%. The noise cancellation is about 80 to 90% but with higher sound volume it's to 100% cancellation. This is also lite on the weight. I am using it with sumsung Note10 lite.  I will recommend this product for people used to with neck band or looking newly for a Bluetooth earphone."
No match for Apple Earpods,3.0,"Review from Apple fan boy recently switched to Samsung Android phone.This is for the second time I bought a earphones , all these years (may be 10+) I used to have earphone which was supplied with IPhone. Last year I bought BOSE 700 headphone so technically boat rockers is my first pair of earphones. Seeing at 4 stars average reviews by124k customers I thought 124k couldn't be wrong but the sound quality is not upto the mark. Feels like cheap plastic and average sound quality may be half of Apple Earpods. Time will answer the quality of cables ."
Good built with Excellent sound,4.0,"Just received this item in semi sealed condition, means item wasn't factory sealed, it's opened earlier though Amazon India's largest online retailer, Appario sold it. Inside the package, it's not apparently disturbed rather.On connectivity, it's blazing fast.Calling quality, Good.Sound quality, better than others of same price bracket.Bass, it's just great.Hardware and cables, better finish, better material, aluminium finish.Charging cable and additional ear pads of 2 extra different sizes provided with 1 year warranty.Recommended for daily use and you can always go for it."

To be honest, wrt sound quality, this Boat one is far behind all of them except MI basic & Byte Corseca where it's equivalent.The reason being, you can't get everything at such a low price point. If you want good quality in-ear wireless experience to be ready to shell out more.Every product category has a minimum price value required for impressive performance. Below that value, compromises need to be made.P.S. Battery backup is not an issue owing to the form factor. It's comparable to BH 505 and ranges around 5-6 hours.

The Best Bluetooth earphone under 1k range,5.0,"I purchased this bluetooth earphone for Rs 899 and its worth it.Pros:1. Best Sound Quality2. Best Battery Backup.3. Fast Charge4. Compatible with phone, iphone, laptop and smart TVCons:1. Bluetooth's range is not that good. It supports range upto 6-7m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it look odd in front."
Fake product,1.0,"Received FAKE product from Amazon,Extremely disappointed, not expected this.. poor bad quality n service, totally unfaithful act.. SELLER NAME - Techfire OfficialI received this product in 7 days which is very delay"
Excellent Product - Affordable pricing.,5.0,"I bought this from Amazon on Sep 8th 2021. I must say the sound quality is uncompromising and the best part is its battery back up. Trust me I have not charged it even once since the time I purchased it. I admit I have to not used it extensively because I use it mostly for calls and light music hearing maybe an hour or two but the rest of the time it is on standby. Even till now by the time I am writing this review it still has 30% battery.I think someone who uses it a lot can give the best suggestion on battery but for me this is amazing.The noise cancellation is okay not too bad and the mic quality is also good, never till now has anyone said to me that they cant hear me clearly or there is a lot of background noise. I am satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone who is reading this."
Simply superb!!!,5.0,"This has to be the best neckband BT earphones from Boat,Superb sound output with damn good bass, trebles ,volcals, mid-lows..even though boat has mentioned it has range around 10 mtrs I doubt it works even without any distortions with more distance than that.I own a 255 for more than a year and JBL Endurance peak as well but sound quality this one produces is definitely way better than both of these BTs.This one has improved in both mic quality as well as noice reductions and I didn't face any issues in calling.No latency whatsoever. Cant comment on battery backup as its only the first day.All the controls working as advertised.I got it for 1250 with Amazon pay later's 250 cash back, at this price there is no competititor for this for sure.Lastly thanks Amazon for 1 day delivery and BOAT for this amazing BT."
Just telling truth It's on you all to believe it or Not‚ò∫Ô∏è,3.0,"Giving three stars bcuz build quality is not worthy and I regret to buy it rather I would prefer oppo enco m31. If I talk about boat then build quality is just ok it's not build for rough use speakers have unbalanced sound bass is not that much good and mid , lows just get fade away when a high bass comesyou have to work hard boatI've used many earphones and headphones in my life like JBL, Sennheiser, sony, ptron, Skullcandy, oppo, samsung, Apple, Moto and many more but experience with boat among all I really got disappointed by boatAnd for you people who loves boat blindly you have to get a better taste please I'm requesting you all as you trust boat just try other brands too bcuz boat is cheaper but it doesn't get that quality and if you are spending some money for a good earphone just add few bucks more and go get better one"
Budget buy with a compromise under 1000,3.0,"This is an Average product with decent bass and acceptable noise cancellationPros1.Its was on sale for 800 , so price is definitely leaning towards the buy factor2.Noise cancellation is decent3.charge holds good for about 6 hours for continuous usageCons the product has a qualcomm chip which is supposed to give these headphones the much needed bass and treble however at slightly higher volume its all garbled up.Next, the biggest issue which i saw was the headphone switching on off leaving a hum when no music was playing. This was really annoying as its noise cancellation headphones.If you have the budget the go for the JBL earphones as they are much better."
Average,3.0,"So after months I am reviewing this product.. Its good if u want to watch Web series or movie or music.. But sometimes it irrites in ear after an hour.. Build is good.. Design is nice good for gaming too but u need to speak loud while talking... Magnetic feature is very light it not attached itself need to fix them plus it unfix in movement magnet is not good.. N everytime it need to connect to the phone that's very bad feature, no vibration on call another drawback... It took around 1min to connect again so cnt connect it if suddenly someone calls if it was disconnected that time. Overall its average n yeah no on off on magnets connect or disconnect.. Thats very very poor"
Great connectivity range and sound quality,5.0,"First time Boat user.Liked:Sounds similar or as good as JBL, Sony, Sennhieser, OnePlus buds and Samsung AKGI was skeptical of Boat, but now i like themSturdy buildFast charge, looong battery life. I am a long distance motorcycle tourist, these earbuds play music non-stop for 12-14 hours and i end my day with 80% battery leftVery waterproof. I have used these in a day full of rain and operated with wet hands many timesDisliked:The ear hooks slip out of my ear. I have tried all their sizes.JBL and Boult Audio fit my ears perfectly.Earbuds slide out of my sweaty ears"
Very nice product with good value for money.,4.0,"It's very nice product in this price segment. It's been delivered today's morning. Battery life is extraordinary. I have been using it continuously and still it's showing 100% battery. Calls experience is very great and voice is very clearly audible to the call receiver. Sound quality is also very good. Bass is also good but it is not so great as my Airdopes 441, hence, little bit disappointed. Build quality and appearance are average. Aptx is not there only AAC and SBC are working. Pairing is so good and new edition is provided with v5.2 bluetooth version. Over all, it's very great product and gives perfect value for money."
Good earphones. Good enough. Value for money.,4.0,"Despite looking thin, the wires hold up good against wear and tear. The ear hooks made out of rubber are detachable, hence it is pretty easy to lose them.The battery life is not as great as promised. 8 hours when idle, maybe. Under constant use the battery life will be enough for you to watch two to three movies or approximately 5 hours.The port for charging is covered with a rubber based plug, which is surprisingly durable despite not looking as much.Sound quality is good, Bass is okay. Noise cancellation pretty much the same as most other in-ear models.It is a good buy, value for your money."
Worth buying... And I liked it..,4.0,"Worth buying this product if you have a limitted budget of 1.5 KJust to note this earphone comes with bluetooth v 4.1 and CSR 8635 chipset, but there is a confusion with amazon itself... in desc its mentioned 4.1 however in pictures its shown as 4.2.. The seller is selling us version 4.1. Please amazon correct it!! Customers would face the loss in case of any mis communication.Talking about build quality, sound clarity and looksI personally liked it.. Bass is really good no noise while hearing. If you are listening into a good melody songs you would dive into the music. Look wise as depicted in pictures it looks different from the black and red..I use for jogging and excersise and the fit is good.. it won't get dropped off.Battery is ok I am getting around 6 hrs in a one full charge. Battery capacity could have been increased at least to 10 hrs by Boat. But no worries..."
Boat....A audio brand to be Trusted,5.0,"In previous year 8th may,2020 I have ordered the same earpiece....bt in a year the battery lyf of the earphone degraded.Though I have also used the earphone in a rugged manner.18hrs always on....weared it in rainy season too.Apply sanitizer due to covid when coming to home.But the quality of the audio didnt degraded at all,neither the wire got torn after so bad use.Only the battery lyf degraded.But still in a very less hope,I lodged a complain in boat in 5th may,2021 about the battery lyf.The very nxt day a pickup was arranged via bluedart for checking the earphone issue.They took it....still i was not sure what boat is about to do bcz within 3 days the warranty period is over.Bt a msg came they have replaced my earphn & sending a new one.I was literally shocked about the customer service they has provided me.No cl nd nothing,only a mere mail...nd this much response from their side.They have gained my trust.Only when i bought it I used to recommnd boat to all of my known ones & to my surprise my office coordinates,family member now owns a audio gadget of boat.I myself has given business of approx 50 items to boat alone in a single year only by recommnding....üòÖ...nd i will continue.Also a request to boat,that we know itz an Indian brand,by also plz try to produce the earphn in India lyk mivi,if possible.I knw their may be some facts,bt itz still a request."
I'm a BoAtHead ‚ù§Ô∏è from Now On!,5.0,"Super Bass is like ""Baby Ko Base Pasand Hai"". Good sound quality. Noice cancellation is Okay. Fits perfectly with in-ear buds and ear lock holds firm while sports activities. You can remove those ear lock silicon holders if not running or sports activities. It's optional, it depends upon one's usage For a cool nifty tip use a paper clip to hold the plug wires firmly togather while excercises like pushups, crunches. It is likely to fall off your neck if you do these exercises. I hope in next version of this ear heads the company will notice it for it's boAtHeads fans. View my uploaded pics for details."
Good Quality Sound but observed other problems,4.0,"Boat rockerz BT headphone.1. Product quality is decent. Sound quality is good. Works perfectly as an in-ear headphone, as you won't hear much outside noise or even outside sounds once you're plugged in.2. You will hear audio assists when you switch it on, pair it to Bluetooth, switch off etc. That is a good feature.3. Placement of the earpiece is problematic. I found it difficult to place it initially, but I figured it out later. Now, after 3-4 days of use, my ear hurts because I have been placing them in ear. So that's a bad thing.4. I noticed that the headset attracts a lot of dust when used. So on the black headset, you can see dust particles sticking on."
JUST BUY IT!!,5.0,"This is the first product ever where I have given a full 5 star rating. To start with, I read a lot of pro's & con's for this product & understand that most people rate products more as per their expectations than actually the quality of the product. This product covers all areas, i.e. Looks, Performance & Sound Quality. I know 4 hours of battery life (listening to music) on full charging lowers people's expectations but it's still worth the quality of sound this product delivers. If you are a EDM fan, then this product gives you a live discotheque feeling around. I am completely satisfied purchasing this product & I can suggest anyone buying this product 100%. JUST BUY IT Specially when there is a PRIME USER Discount Sale On!!!!"
"Simply good,  definitely you can go for it........",4.0,"Good at this price range,Sound quality is good,Build quality is also good,Fast charging feature makes it more worth (20minutes charge = 4 hours backup) ,Very light weight, it doesn't let you feel that you wear something on your neck.It's range is 10m. which is also good.Specially made for base lovers.Cons:-It  irritates when you listening music on full volume, sound doesn't get distorted but it irritates on full volume,so it will be better if you keep its volume below  80%.Battery backup could be better but it's fast charging feature minimizes this con.Definitely you can go for it......."
Defective,1.0,Appario Retail (aka amazon warehouse) Cheats people again. The item came with left earpiece having sound problems out of the box. Sound would keep going in and out in left earbud. However the most ridiculous thing is that the set stopped charging or turning on after only one day of use. I have never seen such bad quality and I am sure it is because Apparico is selling defective products as always. This seller should be raided and banned permanently. Already flouting laves and then cheating customers too
Best Bluetooth earphones,5.0,"I brougth this product based on reviews and now i am not regreting.i got it delivered on next day as i live in same city as of seller.sound quality is very goodits a little heavy than wired earphones but still they are very much comfortable.(I WEAR THEM WHOLE DAY)i get used to it  within 30 min and battery life is also very good.if u have budget of maximum 2000 rupees even then they are the best earphonesonly i prob i faced is of rangewhen connected to my phone(which is really old now, its micromax canvas) the voice cracks when i go upstairs but no such prob when connected to laptopone more prob is that this is made in china but still quality is very good"
Must buy product,5.0,"Fantastic bluetooth Earphones so far. Battery bakcup is just bad**süëåüèªüëåüèª. You can use 30 hour continuously at 50% volume or below. And stand by mode has long lasting battery backup. Sound & bass quality is also nice. But not like boat 225 wired model. Model 225 has some another level of sound quality. But though you can use this while long traveling, or doing some work. One drawback is after connecting when you receive a call while you laying down, another person cannot hear your voice. Rest things are good."
Review after a month of usage,4.0,"The best part about these is the battery backup. I am a heavy user, and these easily last me almost 3 days with an average of 10 hrs usage every day at medium volume.Works perfectly with android and apple devices. I use this with a MacBook for taking zoom calls and never experienced any problem and the other person never complained as well, so the audio is also good.The sound quality is not the best. You might find some other brands to have better sound quality, but you can still live with it.My main reason for buying these was the highest battery backup and they don't disappoint.There used to be a slight hissing sound in the beginning when these were new, but I don't notice it anymore. Maybe I got used to it or the headphones are burned in by now.Good choice for taking calls and long battery backup."
Good but not great,4.0,"writing this review after a month's sporadic use. I bought the ear phones mainly coz I had to take my evening walks on my terrace due to covid and hence, i wanted wireless earphones tht work while moving within a given radius which is far less than the stipulated 10m distance. on tht count, I found the earphones disappointing. When u r on the move, the sound quality suffers even if u were kind of close to ur phone. Not totally bad but I wouldn't recommend it. Otherwise when idle and sitting at one place, sound quality is quite good. Battery n other functionalities work just fine. Fits well."
Terrible headsets,1.0,"I bought one recently and below was my experience :1) the wireless range is very low.2) battery life isn't good either.3) boat is known for it's bass, but this one's bass was terribly unpleasant.Final verdict : Don't buy it. Better go for Mi sports basic headsets that 's much better and has a balanced sound. Or if you have a good budget, go with the Jays t-Four or RHA, they are just WOW!!"
Honest review after using for a month,3.0,"I have been using this for more than a month now, especially bought for my work from home operation for many calls and meetings but that's where it's a big mistake I have done by purchasing this. This is too worst at noise cancellation. Examples : teammates told many times about too much disturbance from fan sound, even to worst they enquired whether I'm bringing up any CROW as a pet(crownsound is way too far at outside) and it is not showing correct battery level. It showed 80% and trusting this I went to meeting but it got disconnected due to no power. When it comes to music listening, that's in a exact opposite. Perfect bass and clarity even with less volume level also easy to fit and good ergonomics.Pros :1) Sound clarity2) Bass effect3) Easy to connect and well fit4) Design and look wise goodCons :1) Worst at noise cancellation2) Battery percentage not showing correctly3) Too long time to hold for on/off"
"Used them for 2 years. Decent for price. Highly durable, Average Sound.",4.0,"I am writing this review after using these earphones for 2 years.-Sound quality is decent looking at the price-Noise cancellation is average, Ofcourse you won‚Äôt get active noise cancelling earphones at this price point.-They are really durable, I have used them daily for 2 years for Gym and during commute to my college. Earphones got little wet on several occasions and still worked absolutely  fine.-Battery life is also really good. I had to charge them once in 2-3 days because i used them a lot on daily basis. If you dont use them a lot on daily, I would say they will easily last you for 3-4 days or maybe more.-Overall I would say ‚ÄúPaisa Wasool‚Äù, The left earphone has stopped working after 2 years but I am satisfied with the product as I really put it through some serious usage."
Good and Bad,3.0,"Sound good but build quality poor.I have been using this product for more than 1 year continuously for both phonecalls and movies.Sound quality bis very good. But issue is, it's build quality is very poorBoth the left and right ear dongles have got loosened. I have to use devi quick to join them. But still they come off and the wires dangle out precariously.Due to this sound in one of the ear pod has reduced drastically. Now I am thinking of buiying a new one but not boat rockers as I feel they are charging premium for a ordinary product."
The notification noise is damn annoying,1.0,"The ""you've plugged into nirvana"" everytime you put it on gets progressively annoying but the every 2 minutes notification of ""oops battery low"" for 5 straight times makes me levitate with anger. The battery life is mediocre at best and most definitely doesn't last for 8 hrs. Instead of charging it, I sometimes leave it for 2 days after the battery has died just so I don't have to hear those god awful notifications. Going back to OnePlus bullet Z for wireless earphones. Boats wired earphones are pretty good though, that's why I got this. The reviews looked good, big mistake."
Great value for money product,4.0,I bought this product to replace my wired headphones which was preventing me from getting up during work from home. This perfectly serves my purpose. I now walk around and stretch while attending meetings.Pairing is fast with both Laptop and Mobile.Now the best part of this product is the battery backup. I get a whole week (5 days meetings and music) of usage on a single charge.  The ones I had used before hardly gave me 8 -10 hrsSound quality is very good for the price you pay and so is the mic. Its too early to mention anything about long term reliability. I hope it lives up to that.
IP 6 headphone having fast charging.,3.0,"By using for a month here detail review:1: Sound quality good but not as Boss or other premium brand. As you add sugar the sweetness increase.2: Battery life for continuous call about 4 hour,for music 5 hour. Stand by time 1 day to 3 days. If you are using extremely than its depend upon appliances use.3: Range of device is about 15 meters after that it get disconnected.4: The good things is it's fast charging features by which it charged upto 40 min to full."
Worst product false publicity,1.0,"Guys, don't at all buy this. I was actually looking for 0 or -1 rating star otherwise I could have selected it. The product quality is pathetic and the sound quality is worst than the Nokia wired headsets we used to get in olden days which are far better. All these brands just engaging the celebrities to see their worst quality products and as you know all no celebrity use these kind of cheap product and they are just for publicity promoting the product. Instead of wasting money on big big celebrities and they should put that in manufacturing good quality which is enough for customers to buy.  Trust me on this guys, I am a good researcher on the headsets and used lot of them so i can easily identify the quality and sound of the product. Don't waste money on this as there is no return refund available on this product if you already ordered it."
Worst for #WorkFromHome,1.0,Pros:Best neckband under 1kSound quality and Noise cancellation is 10/10Bass quality 9/10Metallic finishCons:Comfort 0/10We can't use for Webinar or any online meetings bcoz it gives distorted sound and whenever there is a little net fluctuations will face even worst situation..We can't use it for more than 1hr..we will be facing health issues.. headache and pain in ear due to weight of earbuds..it's metallic but it's not preferred for even a normal use..we will be dwarf within 3 month..don't buy it..if you still want to take risk..your welcome..
Boat Rockerz - Top Notch,5.0,"I bought Boat Rockerz 255 sportz neckband in August 2020. This is an excellent neck band. I am a bass lover. This has remarkable bass and no words to explain more. And boat's customer service is also equivalently excellent. One side speaker on my neckband stopped working a month back. As it's still under warranty period, I submitted a complaint on this in boat's website and requested for a home pickup. They did so and within 5 days from the pickup date they delivered me a new neckband with the same colour. I never expected. Hats off to the product, boat's customer service and Amazon for partnering with such an amazing company. More than happy with the experience.I generally don't write reviews, but this experience made me to write. Hope this would help someone."
Battery issue üò§,5.0,"The bass and sound clearity is just awesome..very comfortable...call quality is also awesome...but the battery seems not ok.I got the product delivered yesterday after unboxing the product I noticed that the battery was 100% I have continuously used it for like 2-3 hours and the battery % came down to 80% again I have used it for like 2hours and the battery was still 80%.Day 2,In the morning I used it again for like 30 minutes suprisingly the battery was still 80% I was just amazed.Later I dint use it till the evening.Later on at 7 I used it continuously till 9 pm and yes the battery was still 80%.Here the real problem occurs after the my dinner I was relaxing in the balcony and was on a phone call suddenly I started getting beep sounds from my new boat 255 earphones and the I checked the battery% it was 20% I was like whaaattttt!! seriously!! Like 5mins before it was still 80% and out of nowhere suddenly it went down to 20% this really pissed me off and within 30 seconds battery down totally dead...horrible.I'll check it again tomorrow if I still the same problem persist I'll have to replace the item between the build quality, sound, call quality is really good.That's all for now amigos."
Never buy this Earphone from Amazon,5.0,I have used boat Rockers earphone since 1-2 yrs but i have always experience that  whenever i buy it from Amazon its a defected pieces or a duplicate one as it doesn't works properly for a long time. I buyed this earphone on 6 th may 2021 and it isn't properly working today . It didn't worked properly for even a month just wasted my money. The earphone disconnects automatically even if i haven't disconnect it . While watching and video some the words in a video are cut . First i thought the video must be like but when i disconnected the video and listen the video again i was able to hear everything.

The humongous battery,5.0,"As said the battery backup is humongous. 40 hours backup really works great. I received the product on 26th September. I did not charge it. The battery was 100%. I used it for 6-7 hours daily for music l, calls, video calls, youtube watch, movie watch(volume 60% approx). it lasted 4 days, on 30th September. Charging took about an hour wich 33watt charger.As I am a JBL lover so soundwise I am not impressed. Above 60% it's screeching sound. I don't observe any bass only treble. Those who haven't experienced anything like JBL, Senheiser, Skull Candy won't find any difference. For them the sound is awesome. The mic is near mouth making it easy to talk on calls just through whispering (good for love birds). You won't be able to listen anything around you while listening to it on more than 45% volume.Call wise it was fantastic. Voice cancellation works fantastic even in outdoors. Voice clarity is awesome.It is not easy to break or delicate. You can use it rough.Type C charging gives it an edge as most of the phones now comes with type c charger. The charging cable comes with a bit longer than usual lenght(as given with earphones)."
"Battery Life is Great, Vocals could be better",3.0,I bought them in December 2021(Boat rockerz 255 pro plus). Got them for 1069INR. So i think they are worth the money but for 1499 i doubt it.Still you get these though-40hrs of battery life-i only charged them every 10 days and only for 10min-sound: bass is loud but the 500rs boat wired are much louder than these-vocals:i felt like they prioritize bass over vocals so expect low vocals for calm music-magnets are superweak-dual connectivity is there-light weightI don't know what else you want to read.Go for it if you can manage to get them for less than 1300(boat rockerz 255 pro+)I hope this helps.(As of December 2021)
"Value for money ,battery boss",3.0,"Purpose : had taken it for cycling purpose and office teams call purposePros1) battery backup is insane,like have used mi earbuds before ,no comparison,u just have to charge once n forget the charging cable.and belive me ,thus is so stress free for any device which doesn't require continuous battery monitoring.2) just ok sound clarify ,(like bass n other stuffs)No so good things1) comfort : just ok ok, meaning I regularly use mi dual driver earphone ,so comparing with that, I didn't feel this not so great ,in fact my main usecase was to wear while cycling(4 hrs continuous),after 3 hrs ,it feels uncomfortable .but not so serious ,just not the best .for 30min to 1 hr no problem.2)music quality: I am not a music expert do give much details,but I felt old earphones( mi dual drivers) were better than this .And obviously it doesn't give any dope feeling ,just ok ok.Neutral1)call clarity2) mic (Audio in call for the receiver person),Have used for teams call ,it was fine.3)Overall build and usability,wires,ear rubbers.This allows to pair two devices at a time ,that is u can pair mobile n laptop at same time ,but it will take either mobile r laptop output at a time, sometimes it will be in mobile n u have to force it to connect to laptop ,so I felt for teams calls normal earphones is better."
Super awesome üòé,5.0,"Posting a review after 8 months of daily usage ‚ò∫Ô∏èGood sound clarity, awesome looks, fits snugly in my ears without causing any discomfort. Charges quickly. Came well packed and with extra ear muffs. I‚Äôm still using the original ear muffs the earphones came with though, coz they‚Äôre still in perfect condition üòä Taking calls on this is a breeze. Perfect for workouts too!"
Rocking even after a year. Go for it.,5.0,"So I am writing this after a year. The set is still working as newThe headphones are excellent for listening, but don't make a good calling device. The person at opposite end will hear a lot of ambient noise, even the slightest movement  at your end will become annoying for him.Basically it will pick up niose even if you turn your neck or the headphone brushes with your collar.Would have loved it if the voice within was that of an Indian. This western sounding male is very irritating to hear."
"Sounds Good, Boat should not have put the annoying voiceovers instead of signal beeps",4.0,"The sound quality is good, there are plenty of other reviews to attest to that, but for some reason boat decided to put a heavily pretentious white guy voice gimmick over every thing - power on, you're now connected. But the most annoying is the dumb voice repeated every time you hit maximum volume, do we really need ""Maximum Volume"" to be repeated loudly each time you hit that? Literally every other high-end brand uses a beep to signal the indicator - learn from them."
"Only battery is Good, everything else is the worst. 255 Pro is better.",1.0,"EDIT: These headphones started giving problems with Bluetooth range. I contacted service center and they scheduled a pickup. It‚Äôs been 1 month and I haven‚Äôt heard back from Boat customer service team. I have begin to feel that my 1500 Rs are wasted and I won‚Äôt get the headphones back. Really pathetic customer care center.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-I bought this because I had 255 Pro already and I was under the impression that this will be an improved version but No. Except battery, this is just like any cheap headphone with no proper sound quality, no proper bass, a lot of noise. I would rate it 3 just for it's battery."
Just Awesome !,5.0,"Battery Life. Oh god they go for atleast a week! This is much of battery not even offered by top brand.Music quality. Man the bass is good idk most people care for it. I like my MIDs clear and yes mids are good and treble is okay.Build Quality. Okay so you get much in terms of build quality at this range but the builds is sturdy and dropped it nothing happens. It is high quality abs plastic. Go for rokerz 335 if u want silicone build.Price. Okay for the price of just 1400 /- youbare getting very good deal.Waterproof, comfortable, other things etc. Okay so they are IPx7 yaht mean you can gonin rain üåß and they still function. They are comfortable and you can run easily. But they do sometimes glid off my ear.And also USB C fast charger make it much more awesome as it not offered by much. Mirco usb nit a way to go right now."

  ¬†Transparent review. (Started using from last 1 week)ForSound quality, and battery life - you can opt this without doubt.Notice cancellation - I have used it during travel - but stil I don't got any complaint. I think it's okay.Bluetooth range is good. (Note: you can't get connectivity if you vary different floor of the building. But it survive 5-8m. And I say it is completely fine. Having Bluetooth headset- you will be having your mobile somewhere near to you)Connectivity - I tried connecting it in both my laptop and Mobile simultaneously. It got connected but the voice of the device (laptop/ Mobile) started breaking even if I use only one device at a time. But yes, no problem shown if I connect only one device at a time.Battery- you will forget to charge the device as it have a good battery life. I continuosly used for 5 days (AVG 6-8 hrs per day) after full charge.Value for money - you will be satisfied.  Go for it.And yes, just a tip: all the electronic items should be handled with care. So, show love and care in your actions (Handle with care) - That give life to your product.Boat - Being an Indian company, I really admire their product quality and their growth in these time period.(I bought it for 1099, with it)"
Earbuds are giving chirrr chirrr magnetic sounds while pressing them in ears.,4.0,"Ear buds Is making a sound chirrr chirr while pushing them in ears. Looks like buds quality issue, buds are not very good but fit to ears properly. Battery life is awesome, using from one week 2-3 hours a day but still it is having 60% battery.Overall earphones are awesome but I'm irritated with this chirrrr chirrrr magnetic sound in earbuds while pressing them in ears."
Affordable and reliable.,4.0,"I have been using the product for the last few months and I am surprised by its battery life. It can be used for 6+ hours continuously on a single charge. The connection is smooth and the mic works great. I bought it for calling purposes so I am happy with the product but since I have used JBL and BOSE in the past so the quality of sound and bass is slightly low. However, for the price which I got, it was a steal."
"Honest review, after using some time",3.0,"I brought this earphones and now I'm writing the review with experience using it (I'm a light user not a heavy user).Battery backup lasts Max 3 hrs üò≠ since the time I bought, the microphone is very very bad, you might sound very low or like talking from a long distance üòì.I brought this on Jan 2020. This was billed for 1399 that time.Product quality is acceptable, but the price will be too much when comparing the battery backup, microphone quality and the bigger size button/cable."
Value for Money,4.0,"1st product I used in Bluetooth Segment for 1.5yrs...And more than Happy.Pros :-1) Good Battery Backup - About 12-15Hrs.2) Nice Sound Quality3) Easy to access - Call receiving, cut call, pause, play, next, backCons:-1) No active noise cancellation2) Poor Range of Bluetooth - atleast not as mentioned3) No incoming call vibration alert / siri/google supportOverall good product...Go for it"
Boat Rockerz 255 user review,4.0,"Over all good product. At discounted price it was value for money.Some -ve are,1) The bud quality need improvement. They are hard & prolonged use is irritating.2) Before buying I checked some reviews. My requirement was to use it for two mobiles & some reviews confirmed it but actually it is not the case. Manufacturer must have specified in description. You can synchronised may be with multiple devices but can operate only on one device at a time. I was really disappointed. I have Chkokko device working fine for more than 2 years now with two mobiles connected simultaneously."
"DON'T BUY THESE, GET SOMETHING ACTUALLY WORTH YOUR MONEY LIKE THE ONEPLUS",2.0,"The product is just like ""doable"" that is it, the neck band is very uncomfortable and keeps on moving around pulling the earphone, the earphone bud material is not so good and the earphones overall start painting after like 20-30 mins of usage. Before these I was using the one plus wireless earphones and they were better on everyway. Please save up your money and go for them. Also the magnetic feature in this is very useless, the earphone doesn't shut down when the magnets are connected and the pulling power is like next to nill, also the audio is not so rich and you can feel the audio quality is like those of the 300 rs wired earphones.DON'T GO FOR IT I WILL SAY."
Decent,4.0,"Honestly speaking I have been using boat rockers 255 for last 2 years it was very good in terms of loud music,high bass and treble... But now I have switched to boat rockers 255 pro 1st it doesn't supports much to Dolby Atmos as it is not up to the mark and it has very decent sound and bass is not as 255 this time it has been reduced but has voice/music clearity and the material is very smooth overall it is good I hope boats give still more bass and loudness."
One of the best,4.0,"It was delivered well before time.Product was in good shape.Best feature is its noise cancellation and how perfectly it fits in your ears.Pros -Very powerful bass.Very good Noise cancellation.Fits perfectly in ears.Battery backup is very good.Has voice command feature using which you can search change song or play specific song without touching your phone.Desing is very comfortable and sit comfortably around the neck.Light weight, you won't even feel if its around your neck or not.Cons -My last earphones were Sennheiser, and Sennheiser got the best voice clarity.These are good in terms of bass but in term of voice clarity they don't stand against Sennheiser.Over and all very good product. Quite satisfied with product at this price range. Bass is very powerful."
"100% honest review, these are just average.",2.0,"I researched a lot basis reviews and finall brought them at rs 1000 in republic day sale.Coming straight to review, drop a like if it helps.Cons-------1) biggest con is huss sound or buzz sound at low volume. It is so annoying. I am quite surprised why reviewers have not said anything about this.If you want to listen to songs or calls at low volume. This is not the best, ready to get bothered by consistent hissing sound.2)if you like to run or jog while listening to songs, this one is definitely not for you, since the movement of band will cause lot of noise disturbance while running and will annoy you. Its ok if you want to just sit and listen.3)I don't find the fitting very comfortable, it seem claustrophobic to be. Ears started to pain after 30 minutes or so. Boat needs to work on design of earpiece to make it more comfortable.4)sound quality is not as Supreme as marketed in reviews etc. The lows are very poor. Bass comes to effect after mid ranges. Overall not a very soothing experience in terms of listening.Pros------Build quality is good.Wires look string and premium and buttons looks of good quality plastic.2)bluetooth range is good, no issues encountered while moving from one room to another.3)there is a battery symbol displayed on phone, so you get to know the charge level.Overall summary For me the first con of huss and buzz sound is enough to not recommend you to go for it, I have not tried any other bluetooth headset so can't say which one is best.GO ahead for if you can bear with the same and only listen to music at very high volume."
just in 3 months this product got failed and unable to connect to bluetooth,1.0,"WORST , PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT, I HAVE BOUGHT TWO HEADPHONES FOR MY FAMILY, AFTER 2 months both started auto disconnected by themselves. Heck of issues in connecting them again. Don‚Äôt buy boAt , waste of money and time . looks like cheap ICs might have been used for cost cut but overall I have lost my money, I do have my invoices with me , will go legal on these sellers and company."
Reasonable earphones for the price- but have a short life span seemingly..,3.0,"Wrote a much longer review but the page reset so I am not re-typing- The bass was good (bass lovers might enjoy it..) but a bit too high/heavy for my liking and so it tends to drown out/reduce the clarity of other instruments and the vocals at times too. Similar to the MDR and XB Sony ranges as far as the bass and overall output goes. The battery life is decent at about 6 hours listening at 70-80% + of the max volume. The wireless range was also decent and can be put at approximately 15 feet max - but with say two walls in between (so it might be a little more minus the walls..). The magnetic lock seems to work just fine, have not really tested the microphone much- the widened neckband is great and gives the earphones stability on the neck. My main issue came down to the life span of the product- I thought the build quality and durability was above average but then this happened- Bought this a few months ago but I left it pretty much sealed and untouched in its box (I continued to use my Apple and Skullcandy wired earphones-the sound quality on the Apple pods is still brilliant so I still use the wired ones over wireless earphones whenever possible/not too inconvenient) - so I only started to use the Boat earphones a month or two ago and well- the left earpiece is already malfunctioning and had almost stopped outputting any audible sound on a few occasions now. I did tend to use the earphones at 80% plus of the max volume but if that is the cause for failure then the earphones obviously are not engineered as well as claimed. Now the volume of the left earpiece is softer and less clear than the right- and has faded away completely on occasions that I have tried to listen to music for a stretch of about 4 hours on 80% volume or such- I am just trying to keep the volume low at the moment so that the earpiece does not stop emitting sound completely again- will have no choice but to get in touch with their customer service if the issue persists and see what they say- but the only conclusion I can draw from my experience thus far is that these earphones lack even say Skullcandy's durability which at least use to last almost a year even when used for long stretches of time at about 80-90% of the upper volume limit for music etc."
Very Very Disappointed for music stuck,1.0,"I was trying to use this Boat 255 pro plus with my Redmi note 10 pro but very sorry to say while playing music or playing any video it had been observed after 25 /28 secs every time music became soundless i.e, stucked for 1 to 3 secs and that was clueless to me.But after one exchange similar problem arises.And It is very disappointment.And also I was selecting AAC or Aptax or LDAC in blue tooth codec, but automatically it had turned into SBC. I did not understand whether is is a issue of mobile or neckband.But it is sure that for music stuck 100% neckband is responsible.And it is not expected from BOAT like company"
Decent but...,4.0,"Honestly First bummer was packaging.It looks like it was already opened.The package got little torn.. tape looks off the place. Also, earphones inside also didn't looked like fresh packaging. It really looks like It was used before.but I could be wrong and it could be just bad packaging also.sound is good though , average loud, but not very good. Range is good i can easily use it while moving in my house. You will always feel some disturbance while playing.Also, I tried connecting with multiple devices but it can not be done while it's connected to other device. First, you gotta disconnect it then it can be connected."
Boat rockerz 255 pro üëçüëç,5.0,"I buyied in offer for rs 999 its worth, sound quality is good but some mids and lows in music is overcomed by bass one who want full bass then go for it. Quality of the product is good looks like premium qualityConnectivity is very good u can pair easily with two devices this one gives voice assistant for power off/on and pairing its very helpfull to use.Comfort to wear no pain even if u use for long times less weight and flexible to useIts wont slip from ear.Last thing battery life is decent u will get more than 6hrs under moderate usage and its support fast charging 5V-2A"
Better product if you are looking something just wireless,4.0,"I bought it for my father and uncle. They dont go after sound quality and bass so it was good fit for them.Pros:1. Long lasting battery life.2.budget friendly.3. Light weight.Cons:1. bass is not upto mark2. Magnet is not that strong ( i personlly uses one plus bullet z it has very weak magnetic hold but this model has even worse)‚óèI would recommend this who is looking for calling purpose specifically drivers, delivery guy cause it has long lasting battery life upto 3 days almost. And has decent sound quality (not cheap but I would give it 3.5 stars for sound.)‚óèDont buy if you are looking for better sound quality and bass."
Audio sync issue,3.0,"Cons:1. Audio sync issue in online videos after being interrupted with a call. You need to disconnect and connect again for getting proper sync.2. Noise cancellation in call is not upto the mark, people at other end hearing all sounds.3. My Mobile battery is draining fast after I start using this. Did not face this issue with other BT headsets.Pros:1. Audio quality is good.2. Fast charging really works. 10min charge giving nearly 3 hrs continious playback.3. Can pair and connect to multiple devices simultaneously. This really helps to those who watches videos on PC and attend calls from phone."
Red is what attracted me in the first place!!! Y,5.0,"Yes. The color Red is what attracted me in the first place. I find it intriguing to see this color on this head set.Being one of the big fans of boAt, I always though to have an attentive earphones and finally I found one. The sound quality is splendid and when you plug in, you attain true Nirvana!!. The bass is awesome and when you listen to high beat songs, you will definitely notice that. The band grip, the ear plugs and the hooks that help in retaining the ear plugs, everything was fine.However, I find that the bluetooth connectivity getting diminished day-by-day. At first the connectivity used to retain more than 10 mts. But after using it for some 2-3 weeks, it becomes weak. The hooks wouldn't stick around.All in all, I find it by far the best product in this price range."

Honest Review after 2 years of usage!,1.0,"Purchased boAt Rockerz 255 in October 2019. Within 5 months of usage, the right ear piece started putting out lower volume than the left ear piece. Thankfully it was still in warranty so got it exchanged in June of 2020. Today is 23 July 2021 and the new replacement also is having the same issue. The right earpiece output volume is very low, exact same problem as the last one. The unbalanced volume causes irritation especially when watching movies or listening to music.This is actually a very common complaint with boAt Rockerz 255 and their other wireless products. If you google it, you will find 1000's of people like me who have just blown Rs1000/- for a product that doesn't even last a year properly. The annoying thing is I cannot even get my money back or exchange these.Pros:1. Fits in-ear properly2. Good bass and volume.3. Decent range. More than 10 Meters in line of sight. Catches my Bluetooth signal from my phone even when in the other room.4. Decent design with attractive colours.Cons:1. Completely unreliable product and boAt Rockerz 255 hasn't even made an effort to correct their mistakes. I am now left with Rs1000/- junk which is hardly one year old.2. Microphone is extremely sensitive. Caller hears all the background noise to a point I have had to disconnect the headset just to save some headache for the caller. There are times where I had to turn off the fan because the air from the fan was creating enough noise to irritate the caller.3. Battery  Low warning to unit completely shutting down is way too less. It gives hardly 5 min warning before shutting down.4. Battery doesn't last more than 5 hrs at full volume. Might last the promised 8hr but that would be at 50% volume.5. The charger port cover is flimsy that it breaks in the first couple of months. Happend to both the headsets.Overall, I suggest you avoid this product till boAt Rockerz rectifies the issues, recalls all the faulty headsets and either replaces them or repairs them. This product reminds me of the cheap Chinese junk."
Don't buy if you listen good music for longer time,3.0,"I bought this product after using one plus wireless z bass edition for a brief period of time.Coming to the boat rockers 255 pro plus:1) Battery life 10/10 The beat thing about this earphone.Charging speed and battery performance is at par with claims.2) Not very comfortable.The built is unsatisfactory, sharp edges and heavy weight. Your ears start paining after some time of usage.3) Sound 6.5/10 - Not very satisfactory for music lovers4) Cannot be used for exercise purpose, it keeps jumping on your neck because of band stiffness.5) Mic quality is decent6)Connectivity is good7) Buy only if your usage is moderate and you want your batyery to last long."
Misleading details. No aptx,1.0,"It said that there is aptx, but only got aac, whereas on my other earphones, got aptx hd. It doesn't have aptx guys, the product details are misleading. Hence returned the product"
Average product,3.0,"This product is average in sound and built quality. 3.5/5.It comes up with good boat packaging and additional set of earbuds rubber in different sizes similar to other products. However 'Rockerz' branding is missing which is not big deal.Previously i have used sony, nokia, skullcandyand  JBL bluetooth headphones, so its difficult for me to lower down with boat. If you want to listen music then its good option. Little Bass is present.Controller buttons plastic plate length is little extra compare to other headphones. LED indicator is tiny and not continously available. Additional rubber curve above earbuds are good for little additional grip.Considering lower price in segment, this product is okay. If budget is your priority or if its your first try with Bluetooth then blindly go for this. It will not put you down.Cheers, Ashutosh"
Stopped working,1.0,"Barely not even a month old, it stopped working, unfortunately just exceeded some days of amazonsnretirn policy.it just suddenly after charging even an hou, says battery low, the red display light (which is usually on while charging) stays lit continously now.Do not buy"
One of the best products i have bought,5.0,"Second ReviewBluetooth connectivity with Windows 10 is getting really bad! Most of the time connection fails and becomes a headache to connect. I tried with 2 laptops and same issue persists. Slightly disappointed. Rest all (Battery backup and voice) is working smoothly as exepected.First ReviewFor this price, its worth it.I use it for my laptop zoom calls mostly. Stays for max of one day if u are in meetings for a total of 5-6 hours. Dual connectivity is ok-ish.Overall- You can go for it. Worth the money"
Bad product and bad customer support,1.0,"It has been 3 months that I have bought this product, it was working fine and suddenly just stopped working..as per the warranty mentioned on Amazon, it was showing one year warranty...I had called customer care and they had told me they will get back to me the next day but there was no help.....infact it was an Amazon choice recommended product....I called the customer care and Naresh who was attending my call told me that Amazon won't be able to help.....such a bad experience... would not recommend to buy this product....I thought Amazon values are linked with Customer first....but looking at the way they deal would not recommend others to buy the Boat headphones..... Overall a bad experience...."
Simply Awsome,5.0,I am not sure on people commenting no deep bass...but it works perfectly with my Samsung Galaxy A50 and Sony Xperia XA Ultra....tried on stock music app (brand provided)  and third party music app its just awsome bass...high and low nodes are too perfect...got at 899 in offer...build quality is also good...and button placement makes easy to use...all control on the buttons...
Review after a year; not worth it,2.0,"Pros: Decent sound qualityEarbuds don‚Äôt keep falling outBand stays around neckEasy to use buttonsCons: Terrible Bluetooth connectivity. Range is less than 2 feet. It disconnects even if the phone is in my pocket and I‚Äôm wearing the earphones.Bluetooth is buggy and will constantly disconnectTalking handsfree is a hassle. Bluetooth handover is not smoothPoor bassAt loud volumes, the sound is distorted.I‚Äôve used these earphones for a year now and it‚Äôs honestly not worth it. For the same price range there are other earphones that are way better. The sound and bass issues are less of a problem than Bluetooth connectivity. They‚Äôre  wireless earphones. Without Bluetooth connectivity it‚Äôs useless. Looks like they tried to cut corners in the wrong areas."
Boatrockers 255 vs JBL T110BT,4.0,"I have this and boat rockers 255, so i m giving a comparison here. Believe me guys this is not at all compared with the boat one. The bass is excellent in boat, where as this does not have at all. I saw the rating and bought it, but please don't get fooled by the name JBL. The sound quality in this is same as a roadside 50 rupees earphone. I paid 800 more for this than the boat, but repented. Only pro in this is the earpieces are lightweight compared to boat one, whereas the holders in boat gives a nice support to hold the ear pieces. Rest any feature you compare the boat exceeds at par."
Good earphone,2.0,"Build quality is good, wire could quality could have even better.Magnetic attachment could have functionality.Sound quality and Range also good,Faster connectivity and good battery backup.Dual paring is excellent, stay connected both phone and laptop at the same time that is what I wanted feature.Update:After using for a few weeks, I found the audio quality is not good and clear compared to cheaper quality earphone."

Best headphones under 2k,5.0,"Before stating it's pros and cons, I would like to say that I've used Sennheiser Cx180 before this which just broke down after satisfactory use of more than 2 yrs. So I'll be comparing sound quality of this with that.*Pros*‚Üí Lightweight‚Üí Superb sound quality‚Üí Attractive & durable design‚Üí Good Battery life‚Üí Google assistant/Siri‚Üí Tangle free wire with magnetic heads‚Üí Sweat proof*Cons*‚Üí Though Bass is awesome, you can find a bit compromise in mids & high, but you won't be able to notice this unless you compare it with some high end headphones.‚Üí Slight pain in ear if you wear it for long.*Overall verdict*9/10Just go for it if you want Bluetooth headphones for ‚Çπ1.5k, you are not getting any better than this.[ EDIT:After using about 7 months one side of earphone stopped working. So I raised a ticket for warranty and also they were able to pickup my product, but unfortunately due to corona they could not replace it as their service centers were closed. I've sent them almost 7-8 mails which were not replied and many calls which were not answered and if somehow they answered 1-2 calls they didn't solved my problem. Now it has already been 3 months and everything is normal after lockdown still my headphones are stuck with them. Finally I have lost hope from this useless company and their incompetent service and I am looking for some genuine brands this time.]"
"Great earphones, but with a few CONS.",4.0,"To the point,PROS:1. The sound quality is good.  The bass is sometimes too much, clarity is compromised. But most of the times, it does pretty good job.2. Pairing and range is superb. Upto 5 meters even 6 it does not cut if no obstacles. Comes handy in gym where i move away from the phone.3. Ansering calls/speaking is very convenient, and because of the band the mouth piece is at the right position for calls.CONS:1. The band is a nuisance in gym when you're running, doing pushups etc, it keeps falling away. Cannot secure it tightly during workouts. Wearing on the head is temporarily okay.2. The fitting of the ear piece is not correct. With the same sized ear tips my other earphones fit very snugly. This one keeps falling off my ears.3. Although the sound quality is good, the clarity is not great if you're concerned about crisp music. The sound is loud and bass is good, but the clarity of music is average.Finally, for this price, This is the best on Amazon."
boAt Rockerz 255 Sports Bluetooth Wireless Earphone review by ViP,5.0,I had bought this earphone for my brother for his office use. Below are experiences:1> The noise cancellation is quite good.2> the voice quality is also great. I can hear people well and they can hear me well.3> The band is light weight and do not feel like a weight on my neck.4> Good to hear songs while running. The sweat do not affect the band.5> The talk time is superb and covers my office time. With one full charge it can go for 10-12 hours.All I can say is I am happy with the product and I recommend you to buy this product if need be without any doubt.
Must buy,4.0,"Hi All,Got this earphones delivered in next day itself once I ordered. The packing was good and the colur of the earphone is the same as shown in the image. Main thing the sound system is awesome and there is a new feature whenever we get a call it says that there is in coming call coming so if in case u r driving u can know when call comes. It has 1year warranty and usb for charging and whenever u charge u can see the red light on. Overall very good bluetooth earphones."
Awesome earphone in an amazing price.,5.0,"Writing this review while listening to music with this awesome earphone. Got this in prime day sale in just 999/- which itself is a great deal. I have used Boat basshead 225 earphone and Boat rockers 400 earlier but this is better than both of them. Comfortable, lightweight, superb bass, great noise cancellation, no issue with pairing with my Android device.  Sound clarity is ok. I will review it again after a month of use."
Absolutely worth the price,5.0,"The best you can get at this price. Fits well and is comfortable to wear for 2-3 hours (don't know why would keep it for any longer). The Bluetooth range is good. Battery backup is also good. Amazed by the sound quality. Usually, other earphones offer quite flat sound in this price range and with these many features. But I found the sound to be crisp and clear in these earphones. Noise cancellation is absolutely not the feature for which you would wanna buy this. But it didn't matter for me, so a 5 star for the overall product."
worst product and after sales service,1.0,"Never ever buy this at all. stooped working after 3 months both side audio not working. when approached customer care they said they will not repair it or replace it. they said it happen sometime so we don't replace for it. what the hell.... worst ""cheap Boat"" brand cant even give customer support after sales. Please no should think of buying it. rather buy sony headphones."
Perhaps the Best in Class,4.0,"I love music. In my phone you will find  music ranging from Mozart to Linkin Park. And for the purpose of enjoying my music I have used various earphones (Sony, JBL, Skull Candy, Sennheiser etc.), but this is my first bluetooth earphones (a birthday gift from my wife) and after using it for 4 days, here I am sharing my detailed review...1. Build Quality ~ Very good. It's very lightweight, but doesn't seem to be fragile. (4.5/5)2. Sound Quality ~ Absolutely brilliant. I had seen many YouTube reviewers claiming that the Bass is this overpowers all the tiny sounds, but that's compeletely wrong. (4.5/5)3. Bass + Treble ~ The balance is quite fine, and if your music player has an equalizer you can tweak the balance according to your liking. (4.5/5)4. Comfort ~ These are lightweight as I have already mentioned, so it is a given that they are comfortable, even when using for hours. But personally, I have found that the left ear hook doesn‚Äôt fit as comfortably as the right one. You can remove the ear hooks though! (4/5).5. Battery backup ~ For me it has been more than 4.5 hours. (4/5)6. Pairing ~ As easy as it gets. (5/5)7. Noise Cancellation ~ Great. (5/5)I got it for ‚Çπ1199 and I can confidently recommend this to you. üôÇ"
Returned the earphones twice!!!,1.0,"I had a 255 T which I lost somewhere, i was quite impressed with the quality of my previous 255T.So I decided to buy another one, a 255 pro, which was supposed to be an upgraded version.The earphone that I received first was working fine for music, but as soon as I would use it for calling or zoom meeting, the voice would start cracking so bad that neither could I listen to the caller, nor did the caller could listen what I was saying.So I went ahead and ordered a replacement.The replaced earphones that I received had the same issue with calling.  The replaced item was even worst and it stopped working at all within 3-4 days.  So I had to return the second earphones for a refund.I was lucky that it stopped working within the return window.  Otherwise I would have been stuck with a non functional earphones.It is worth mentioning that I tried both the earphones with multiple devices, 2 Androids, 1 iphone 7 and 2 windows laptops.  Same problem with all of them.Amazon did an amazing job in handling my return requests.  A big thanks to them for that.I am now going for Sony or JBL, hopefully those would work fine."
Terrible quality - stopped charging after 10 days.,1.0,"UPDATE 2:STATUS AFTER CONTACTING BOAT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT MALFUNCTIONING PRODUCT STILL UNDER WARRANTY:Tried to contact boat portal / company help line number for warranty complaint. Provided genuine proof of purchase (invoice etc).After you've bought the product, they make it really difficult for you to do anything with a malfunctioning product even if it's under warranty.Asking a customer to travel all the way to some service centre (spending Rs +500 for a Rs 899 item) in the city to get the product examined (esp at a time when COVID is all around) is preposterous and reeks of customer apathy. They know customers will not follow through.On contacting the service centre (number provided by boat on their email response to my complaint) over phone, they said ""You want to come come - you don't want to come - it's your problem. This is all I can do. Speak to the company if you have a problem with this.""-------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 1Terrible quality - stopped charging after 10 days only. Dead as wood and wouldn't charge at all. Money down the drain.PLS DO NOT BUY AND WASTE YOUR MONEY."
Sincere and Personal Reviews on boAt Rockerz 255 Sports Wireless Headset,5.0,"I write this review after 4 days of using this wireless headset boat Rockerz 255 sports. I bought this headset with Rs.1399/-. Excellent SOUND CLARITY with DEEP BASS. But, I do no know why some people are given negative reviews for its sound clarity and bass. I think they have listened low clarity music through this headset. If you play a true HD sound clarity file  then you can  experience the music  transmission in true HD sound clarity. Listing 3D music through this headset is awesome. Battery life is more than 6hrs. Light weight and exact fitting in ears without any irritation for a long time. Very bad mic for talking but for music lovers it is fine. Built quality and finishing is not up to the mark. Connected  wires are bit long. Noise cancellation technology is very good."
Go for either rockerzz sports or one plus z not this one,4.0,"I have used it 3 days straight, after then returned it for one plus z (2k).I might personally suit uPro-Have good build quality, metal earpice,  plastic neckband, crystal clear sound.Con-Ear mufflers might pain u depends upon person to person (though after removal problem vanished)Poor noise cancellation or we can say surround sound effect(this was main reason for me) I thought it was fake but who knows may be I have phone with Bluetooth 4.1 .For 1700 it's not value for money.Yes the sports version for 1300 is more good value for money.One plus gave far better deal by just adding 300 more, ie Good noise cancellation despite having Bluetooth 4.1 phone, can easily penetrate 3 walls before distorted sound starts to come in boat it was after 2walls.Insane battery with my use I charge 1time in two days. Though build quality is not premium but it was far flexible(very important) if u r like me who lay downs a lot & put in weird position below pillow before sleep in or in pocket in hurry. Sticks to earphone while in Rockkerzz pro it pops out while doing yoga & workoout."
It does the job @ ‚Çπ999,4.0,"Sounds good enough for the price I paid which was ‚Çπ999. The bass is there but it's not with a thumping effect which most people love. Using an equaliser will not have any drastic effects on its ability, so you have stick around with the audio quality you get, which is mediocre. The Bluetooth connectivity is good but is not far ranged. For eg. The signal breaks down when i move to the next room. The battery backup is wonderful and lasts me more than a day of casual use (provided, I use it for 5-6 hours a day @ approx 60% volume). The charging, as I noticed, takes a little over 2 hours. The battery that it shows in your phone is very inaccurate. My battery was 40% and suddenly dropped to 20% and it started anouncing battery low warning. Once it reaches less than 20% there is a battery low warning every minute. Volume buttons are tactile and feel good. But raising or lowering volume will be with annoying beeps that interrupt the audio. It does not come with a carrying case and the packaging is unimpressive."
Best Headset for the price.,4.0,"Great and comfortable headset. Had no issues in pairing with 2 devices simultaneously. Decent sound quality with high on Bass. Good value for the money.  Have been using during work out and looks like it is really sweat and water proof as advertised.When switched on and connected, the voice that announces is very silly.. ""you are connect to nirvana"" what????? and also when you disconnect or power off .. it says ""adios amiego"".. why an Indian company chose this announcement is beyond me. Wish they had it very simple and plain .. like good bye...Overall a very good headset for the price.."
"Need to work on fitting, it have missing part like sound need real boffer feel",4.0,I am see many review about bass and sound they said to loud but its average means not irritating its give good results. Not to loud nor to much bass but its ok(good) in sound fector. Battery life is so good and if you have fitting problem with cup earphones then you face same problem in here its not for sports. Because after 15-20 minutes its fell loose and when i laugh it come out same like other.This review about boat 255 pro+But overlall experience is value of money near about.And one thing latency is to high you can even notice in video also so never think if you want buy for gaming. if you are only music lover but don't have big budget then buy with closed eye. You never disappointed in terms of sound quality.
Battery is like Batttteeeerrtrtrrrryyyyyyyy,5.0,"I got this product on 08-Oct-2021 with 100% battery; and today it's 29-Oct-2021 and at moment it's still showing 40% battery remaining....(my usage is no music; only call with timing of 9 to 6 on weekdays; calling is heavy as I am into sales job and during COVID, calling is on high side; no use on Saturday and Sunday)So literally around 15 days of usage and I am still waiting to recharge it for first time....I don't know may be it's my usage or what but still waiting for first charging....Bass was tested by my wife and she is satisfied with the voice and bass quality."
Buy only if you want to regret later.,1.0,"Can't recommend.1. There's a clear audio lag though negligible while listening to music it can be felt hard while playing games.2. None of the silicone buds sit well in the ear. Need constant push every couple of minutes.3. Those hooks or whatever, they are you can just throw them away. Don't understand how they advertise these for workout.4. Just some cheap junk endorsed by celebrities to give them premium appeal.Better to go for wired or those true wireless buds if you have the budget.Good luck."
For Gamers and BassHeads üí•,4.0,"A month ago, I bought RealMe Wireless Headset and It‚Äôs Bass and Game-Latencies were pathetic, I returned it immediately.But here, You can clearly feel the BASS and for GAMES like PUBG and COD the audio latency is minimal (compared to RealMe)So if you‚Äôre a BassHead and wanted to use this for gaming with low latency this is the best headset in Rs.1000-4000 Segment.I have listed the audio latency details belowMy Device: iPhone 7Boat Rockerz 255 (Rs.1300):‚Ä¢ PUBG - Classsic 0.2 to 0.5Sec delay  TDM - 0.5 to 0.7Sec delay‚Ä¢ COD - 0.5Sec delay (both Multiplayer & BR)RealMe Wirelesss (Rs.1799):‚Ä¢ PUBG - Classic 0.5 to 1Sec delay  TDM - 1 to 1.5Sec delay‚Ä¢ COD - Multiplayer 1 to 1.2Sec delay  Battle Royale - 1Sec delay"
Thanks Boat for Brilliant Coustmer Service,4.0,So i am writing this review after one year of purchase. After 11 month of use and abuse the earphone finally died. Just before 1 month of warranty remaining i made a complaint on the boat website with not much hope. Within 3 days the product was picked up from my home and after 3 weeks i received a brand new product which i didn't expected at all. At last thanks boat for respecting the warranty period. Now i proudly own 3 different boat products and all them justify their quality and price.
Boat Bluetooth Neckband Earphone working only 13 to 14 month,1.0,"Hi Team,I have buying 3 set boAt Rockerz 255 Sports in-Ear Bluetooth Neckband Earphone with Mic (Active Black) all 3 Earphone working only 13 Month now all Earphone not working.Pls help me on this"
Best BUDGET earphones for awesome voice calls with pretty decent battery life.,4.0,I rated the earphones 4 out if 5 just because i am looking at them without considering their price. If I were to include its price in the equation then it'll be probably 7 out of 5. Yes it's that good in it's price range. What caught me off guard is it's call clarity. I take a ton of voice call on these and the other parties never complained about the call clarity. If you receive a lot of calls on a Bluetooth earphone then you can't go wrong with these. Other than that you don't need to read this review further where I could complain about an over emphasized bass and muddied mids and highs....just watch a few videos on YouTube and you'll be good to go..... Battery life is decent. Call clarity is pretty dope. That's all I have to add on
Not suitable for TEAMS call,2.0,"Sound quality is good. But the main purpose for which I bought this product was to attend office calls on Microsoft Teams and Zoom, but connecting to meeting with this product was an embarrassment as after 4-5mins call will drop and you have to connect to meeting once again."
Great battery backup. Base heavy sound. Call quality is good.,4.0,Battery backup is really good.Call quality is good. But u cannot speak in a very low voice otherwise the other person may not be able to hear you clearly this is not an issue. Mike Quality is good. I have taken a lot of call and nobody has complained about the quality of my voice. But there is no noise cancellation. It will pick up the environment noise. The overall sound is bass heavy. The voice notes are bass heavy. Not natural. I expected a better sound quality. Its only good for the bass lovers. Those who understand the music technicality will not like it. It's good for a casual music listener. These are very light weight. And build quality is good. The price should be around 1200 maximum for these.
Can hear nothing expect a weird crackling sound,1.0,"Review after 1 day of usage.- After 10 minutes of connecting to any device, they start producing a crackling sound.- There seems to be a lag in the audio as well.- The company has made sure that the wire is of low quality material so it does not last long, and you will be  left with no option than to buy a new pair.When they do work, ( magically once in 10 times)- THe sound quality is good, noise cancellation is also good- The sound is a bit bass biased, bass can be truly felt but not so much for the other side."
Overall a great product to go for,5.0,"I got a different colour than what I ordered, blazing yellow would have been awesome but it wasn't. Rest everything is great about this.Also to mention, there is sound latency in PUBG (and yes there will be some latency in Bluetooth device) I read reviews claiming no sound latency ( please do get misguided, if you have used good wireless headphones in past, you would easily notice the latency).Bass is too good(compared to other headphones I used in this price range)It's much better than boat 400 wireless, 390, 900(comparing overall and all the aspects)One full charge would last a whole day.Sadly I returned it because of the colour and latency in PUBG as I have boat 510 too(I would have kept it too if latency and colour issue wouldn't be there).Overall a Greta product to go after. Just too good"
Budget earphone with best quality,4.0,I bought this Bluetooth earphone for online class and casual stuff. I am using it with my Dolby Atmos enabled tablet. The sound quality is like awesome with the Dolby Atmos. You can feel every rythm and beat. And the Bluetooth works fine. The battery usually last me for about 3-7 hours based on the use and content. And it also supports Google Assistant. You can activate the assistant with a 3 second press.
Overall Good But needs some improvement,4.0,"First of all, The Product is amazing.Been using it for the last 2 months and I am very happy with the product's overall performance. battery life is amazing. You can use it for 3-4 days fully functional. The sound quality is decent, Good Bass, Charging is fast within 35-40 minutes it is fully charged and would last 4 days. one amazing feature is you can connect 2 devices at the same time.BUT......The noise cancellation is worse than any other earphones of this range. Also, the magnets are not that effective as Oneplus bullets. Moreover, the earphones are not water-resistant as mentioned by BoAt.And, lastly, it's not related to the product but I received a damaged packaging product was okay but package was not.Overall if you listen to music a lot or play games you can Go for it but if you want to buy it for calling purposes I would you should choose other products."
Good fr 899,3.0,"Got this fr abt Rs. 899(card discount not included, include it if u want, about 100 rs) in great indian festival sale.Pro-1.Really Good sound.2. Very Good base. (abt 90% greater than samsung level u & JBL( used both).3.Good bluetooth earphones at this price. (almost nil competition).4.Good colors(got mine in fave black.Cons1. Material used is cheap. ( but keep in mind it is fr 899 only, fr 1399,dont go fr it.)2.earphones wires r too long fr my comfort.(deducted 1 star fr this)3.Earpieces not at all comfortable fr ur ears in long term. (deducted 1 star fr this)"
No CVC technology. Lot of distortion in microphone.,2.0,"Audio is good, but microphone is bad. The description and package is misleading - there is no CVC (clear voice capture) technology. Such unethical and unprofessional marketing gimmicks are not expected from BoAt company. Highly disappointed with BoAt. Won't be trusting any BoAt specifications from here onwards. They just lost a loyal customer."
Price is lill high,4.0,"I tried infinity, Apple and bolt, over all good product, balance and soft sound quality.Bass is good (high)Vocal is bit lowTreble also bit low.As i am a not bass lover might be the reason I don't like this device. Infinity and apple are much batter than this one.Battery backup is decent, 8 hrsRange is also very nice.Comfortable wise good, but i am a bike rider so it's not ment for helmet users.Quality is good. No -ve feedback.Fonts are different on my ear plugs check the photos."
A good choice,4.0,A good buy for the 1.3-1.5K price rangs.Pros:1. Bluetooth 5.0 does provide a fast and reliable connectivity2. Noise cancellation is good whil watching movies or listening to songs3. Battery back up is good supported by quick charge. 15mins charge does give u a good 1Hr of continuous playback.4. Lightweight flexible fairly good build quality.5. Fit is comfortabke and secure6. Nice base and good sound clarity. Lyrics and instrumentals are crisp and good.Cons:1. Mic pics up a lot of background noise even if its TV running 20-25ft away at medium volume inside the house. Outdoor havent been able to test due to lockdown.Not the best choice if outdoor calling is the highest priority of purchase2. The earhooks keeps coming off the earbuds and there are no replacements are also provided.Hence if u loose the earhooks its gone forever.Although its not absolutely necessary to use the earphones. Without the earhooks also the fit is fairly secure.3. Simultanious pairing of two devices can sometimes be a pain. But its rare amd only in case of new pairings.
Defective Head Phone provided through coating on it,2.0,I have purchased boAt Rockerz 255 Pro in-Ear Bluetooth NeckbandEarphone with Mic(Teal Green) | B082VSJPD6 (B082VSJPD6 )HSN:8517 but now its side edge is not fixing and the coating on it is also removing on its own and also there is issue in hearing while on call the person on the other side of the call cannot hear my voice mostly and also he complain that the voice is not clear and very slow to hear.Also the piece was send defective as the coating was removed on its own the side edge of left ear phone on its own come up as it was fixed through a coating and send me as per the attached images.Request you to please help with the replacement at the earliest.
Worthy @ 799 rs.,4.0,"I got it during Independence sell @999 (excluding 199 rs. Discount.I m waiting this review after 3 weeks of use.Sound volume: I m using realme mobile and I feel that sound volume is little bit low.Sound quality: It depends on device. When I use it with my PC, sound is ossm. Also it give good bass in mobile.Looks and materials: definitely it is good and longevity is high. But it could better if available neck band as boult provide. Other issue is that there is no vibration,so sometimes you will miss the call when earpiece is not in ear.Battery life: charging time is 2 hour approximately. After fully charge, you can enjoy 5:30 hours battery backup.All over no any other issue till now.If your budget is around 999 rs, you can definitely go with it..."
Best headset. Beautiful sound and great battery backup,5.0,"I am using this headset for last 2 years now and i must say i am surprised by its quality.I rarely say this for any of the product but it was worth every rupees I spend on it.Battery : Awesome battery life, at least 3-4 hrs on music and upto 6-8 hrs on standbySound quality : Sound quality is also great. I listen soft music and this headset gives me proper sound that I need.The best thing in this headset is it can connect simultaneously with my laptop and my mobile. This feature is even not available in many higher end headsets."
Waste of money. Not at all comfortable for running/exercise,1.0,"Update: The product is non-functional now.Sound quality is worse than product half of its price. I own infinity bt earphones of similar design which is much cheaper and far better sound quality, lighter than this product.Earpodes comes out when you are running  as it is heavier and neck band is also not at all comfortable.There is no return policy, so do not waste you money.Highly disappointed. And this is my genuine review"
"Worth the price , best quality, IPx5 instead of IPx4",4.0,"Well i used boat products before they are good as they were before.pros - base is good , water resistant ( here doscription says IPx4 but my earphone box says IPx5, and that is even better , you should update your product description. ) , Magnet lock , design .Con - cable is a bit long. As it has control box both side and a little hard cable at back, the remaining cable shouldn't be this long.Above all its a good product. Recommend to all the people who wants to buy a cheap but best wireless earphone."
Loved it.. then now disappointed..!!!,3.0,Review after 4 months of use : using it for online classes.Battery detoriated and now it gives only 2.5 -3 hours backup.Single hand use.Sounds are still awsome bt disappointed with massive low level of battery life ......‚Ä¶.........................Review after purchase:Super dooper sound.Worth every penny.Noise cancellation is just wow.Wear it & forget the world.U will feel the every beat .At this price it's a lottery.
Excellent headphones!! I am very happy with their performance :),5.0,"These headphones are such a good deal! I bought these at ‚Çπ999 during prime sale.- Excellent performance for a low cost!- They are very comfortable to wear, I hardly notice me wearing these headphones.- They were very easy to set up initially and easy to operate.- The sound quality is excellent! I think the design look great too!I had no problem with syncing them to my Pixel 2XL and they stay synced even when I walk away from my phone for up to a distance of 30 ft.I am very happy with the long battery life, since I can be forgetful about charging my various devices.I sweat a lot and that has not affected their performance so far and from what I read in other reviews, it will not be a problem in the future either.All in All, I very much recommend these headphones!Great performance for a low price!"
"Fantastic quality , technology and sound quality....",5.0,"Using for 4 month and don't face any problem yet exept one thing, Battery backup is sincerely ok but The Warning for battery low is not working properly....Manytimes, it shutdown just after 40 - 60 seconds of battery low warning, while it should have to give first warning at 20% battery warning it warn me when 2 - 4 % battery left....I don't know this problem only happens with me due to single defected piece or all product do same, While fullfill it's promish to give 4 - 6 hr of battery backup ( it gives me 5 : 30 hr backup) and Sound qualities is also nice.....I will recommend it 4.5 star for its performance as using for 4 months.....  JAI HIND üáÆüá≥......."
A good earphone for the price range,4.0,"I was so amazed for as to get this one. I acquired a same day delivery. The build quality is top notch, it feels rugged and strong; the wires and the earpiece felt wonderful. Yet, the thing I'd like to regret is it is not as light as the Boult wireless headphones. This is a bit heavy. I specifically bought it for gym as I have three JBL for home and office purposes. So in gym, while on a workout, you can definitely feel the a light weight on your ears.Also, I feel that the wires should be length adjustable as in a Boult headphone. I feel the wires are a bit lengthy. But, this definitely is a better choice than Boult. I compared it with my friends Boult headphones. This one was the best in sound quality, build quality and all.Secondly, the noise cancellation is absurd. Not upto the mark, not even as good as other earphones of this price. But the other qualities like sound, strength, battery, Bluetooth connectivity, all rocks in this headphones. To this price range, this is wonderful."
Good one & After sale service is also very good.üëçüèª,4.0,"I bought it in Jan-2019 & it stopped working in May-2019.Build quality is good & sound quality was also pretty good.But it stopped working & charging. If I charge it for whole night then it is only usable for few minutes & then it is turned off.I claimed warranty & they took my old one & reolaced it with new one. boAt after serviced is very good, I'm impressed. They came to my home & took the defective product & replaced it with new one. It took around 10-15days to get a new one."
Recommended,5.0,"Not recommending for music purpose.If you want it for music then go for head phones instead of this ear phone.If you are taking this for webinars,phone calls,meetings then absolutely awesome.Its purely canceling noise.Even if you talk with very low decible sound it will catch your voice and audible to your friend who talks to you.Absolutely amazing experience....Battery back up superb..."
A Good Earphone at this Price Point‚Ä¶..,4.0,"Few Pros. & Con. As mentioned below -* Need slight improvement in sound quality, it‚Äôs not very noticeable, but can be better.* It has got good quality & clean bass.* It is comfortable to wear with or without the Ear Guides (removable). Wearing along with the ear guides may irritate you but again at the same time it helps to hold it in ear.* Voice of calls were clear & loud to other end but you feel some annoying sounds.* No auto on-off with magnetic bud, this feature can help to improve the battery life."
Worth it,5.0,Nice one.. audio quality is best.. battery is awesome.. really last long..
Life of the boat rockerz 255,3.0,I had purchased my boat rockets in April 2019.Pro's-Fantastic musicGreat calling qualityGreat bassFantastic value for money.Ffw - 6 months after usage of an hour each day for 5 days a week for 6 months -The volume up and music skip button is not workingRegistered a complaint with boat and they took the headphone and repaired it and delivered it back in 15 working days.2 weeks later it does not charge anymore and I am loosing my cool.I have registered my complaint again on the boat website for a repair.Verdict -Fantastic usage for 6 months with usage of 20 hours a month and approx 120 hours in 6 months.Good for 6 months usage.
Satisfied by the product,4.0,"Pros:1. Excellent sound quality for this price range ( I got it for Rs. 999 in sale)2.Long battery life ( lasts 6 hrs after continue usage with a full charge)Cons:1. It should come with an extra pair of ear hooks  as I lost one and unavailable in the online/ offline market for the same model2. Experienced hindrance in connectivity many time while playing it.3. While u r on call it doesn't cancel background noiseEDIT:- it has started loosing the connection in between even though phone is in your hand and it's been only 18 months to the purchase, so think wisely before buying.EDIT 2:- After 20 months earbuds stopped working one by one.  -----THE END----"

Headphone with a style.,5.0,"Date: 17/12/2019- Magnetic back stick to each other while hanging from neck. I usually hang the earphone crossed i.e. left in the right and right to the left and while wearing, I wear the ear pieces properly so that it crosses my neck. This helps the earphone not to fall from back due to wind while driving. I usually wear the earphone with helmet though.- Auto switch off if not in use for quite some time.- Good power usage. Lasts the whole day and 80% charge remains. I charge everyday as a custom.- Microphone has great clarity but don't expect a condenser mic level sound.- Can be used as a hidden mic for speaking in conferences.- Nice placement of buttons for Volume up & down and pause & play.- Nice audio feedback while powering on, connecting, connected, and switching off.- LED blinking light while powering on, connecting, and switching off to know the present status of the headphone.- Easily connected to laptop and other devices i.e. multi device connection and seamless switching between the audio playback from various devices. Preference given to laptop than mobile with mobile phone audio going to pause state.**Update: 19/12/2019**- Earphone turns off when connecting to both mobile and laptop. [Batter Charge: 80%]. First I connect to mobile, then connect to laptop, then earphone turns off. Previously this was not happening. It used to connect to multiple devices and play through each of them seamlessly depending on the output of the bluetooth audio input. Preference was given to laptop over mobile playback."
Good battery life and multiple device connection,5.0,"I used to use Sony XB55AP. So my review of this Boat earphone is based on relative comparison with sony earphone.Sound: very good. As good as sony XB55AP. Bass, vocals and treble all are equally good without any overpowered frequency.Loudness: it's sufficiently loud. My volume for calls is 30, for music in crowded area is 60, Netflix is 30.Noise cancellation: it's good. But it's too efficient in that as I don't insert the buds fully so I am aware of the surroundings. It depends on bud size and ear shape though.Bluetooth: good. I connect phone and laptop simultaneously and can switch between zoom on laptops to phone call automatically. Range is normal - can penetrate one wall only. There is Qualcomm aptx hd support but my phone is rooted so I get only AAC option.Mic : it's good. Blocks background noise and other side can hear me crystal clear.Comfort: the support hooks are very useful to keep the buds in ear while running or gymming. But cause discomfort after around 60 mins of use. I slid them away so I only use when necessary. Otherwise it's comfortable earphone.Design: looks classy. I bought teal blue. Black is too aam junta. Magnets are not strong but that's ok. Probably it's weaker to prevent earphone chamber from damaging.Battery life: that's the best part. My daily usage is 2 hrs calls (phone and laptop combined), 5 hrs video. Daily drain is about only 20%. Can go for a week without charging. Below 20% there is annoying battery low voice notification every 2-5 mins so have to charge it."
Average product from BoAts.,3.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Today on 2.8.2021 i received the package. Packaging was good. Got box intact. Initial impression is good. Sturdy material. Sound quality is better. Better bass effect. It says noise cancellation. But i dont think it make any difference. But voice call is decent. Battery backup is under testing. Bluetooth range is also good. I had ordered 2 of this. 3/8/2021. I found some gaps in the body of this bluetooth battery pack. Images attached. Not satisfied with overall built quality. I don't i this bluetooth will sustain ipx 7 rating."
Superb product,4.0,"I baught that product in 899 on Great Indian Festival sale .In terms of battery it's much extra that you expect , you need to charge just once in a week when you are using it daily for 10 hours  , they said that battey is 40hours but it's much more around 70hours something .Mic quality is impressive , noise cancellation really works wellSound is good 4/5Battery 10/5Mic : 5/5Design : 3/5Build:  3.5/5Comfort : 4/5"
Satisfactory.....,3.0,The build quality is averageA weird hissing sound comes when you are not listening to something but you are connected to a device(the sound stops after 30-50 sec)That hissing sound is really very annoying.The audio quality is great and volume is also very loud.Bass is more than average.Other than that hissing sound everything is great and is value for money in this price range
Great product | Water resistant,5.0,"Purchased this for the second time as lost the first one. The product is fantastic and the bass effect is superb. Using this product for multi purposes including running, cycling, and commuting. Cycled in the rain and so far nothing has happened to the product. Recommend it as it is also less expensive."
Felt irritated using it. Don't buy it.,1.0,"Pros : Best sound quality in the segment around 1500.Cons : The welcome, maximum volume, battery low messages voice is very irritating.Don't buy. You will feel irritated. It's like SIRI/Google Assistant getting active every now and then.The work would have been done by a beep sound.I don't use it anymore, I gave it to my sister as I like electronics to be useful not irritating.The moment you the love the music and start to increase the volume, it will shout : MAXIMUM VOLUME.And when you would like to shut the sound, it will say : MINIMUM VOLUME.I know it's minimum volume, I have done it myself don't tell me b****"
Loved it,5.0,"Good quality earphones. Good noise cancellation. A piece of advice: if you use this with 2.4 GHz WiFi, then you might fave lagging or Internet issues because Bluetooth works on the same band, and the two interfere with each other. Best if you use 5 GHz WiFi. But note that this is NOT a problem of this product; every Bluetoith earphone will cause some interference with 2.4 GHz WiFi."
Waste of Money üòûüò†,2.0,"I bought this headset after listening to positive reviews from a popular youtuber in his channel. Now I regret my decision to buy this üò†This is my review after 8 months of usageI got it for Rs 999/-The sound quality & bass is ok.The range is around 10m without any obstacles in the way.The worst thing is that it doesn't fit into my ear properly. It always keep falling out.üëéI tried the 3 pairs of earbuds provided with the earphone. No use üëéüëéIt can't be used while doing exercises or gymming. The neck band kind of jump around with u when you move. Again the earpiece fall out. It might be a design flaw.Can't even use to make phone calls or recording audio or voice. Same issueüëéüëéüëéAfter a while , when you turn your head or when u  move or sometimes it comes out of ear by itself.Now I only use this to watch movies because it's wireless & I can put it back when it goes out of place.Doesn't serve the purpose.

Battery backup is very good.,5.0,Battery life almost 2 week for just calling purpose3 days for full use (continues music listing and talking)20 days for idle situation. Just connect not utilize30 days for standby time approx.Bass quality is almost like sanhizer / jblNoice cancelation algorithm Also works good.But feel high weight on the right side ear bcz of side control button unit.Control unit contain 3 same size button so confusion when ON or OFF or call receiving and rejecting find the middle button.Quick connect.Latency is sometime more.Quick charge.

Over all 3.5/5 sound and build quality to be improved,4.0,I have used the product for more than 4 months... and just started feel like I'm using it for few hours..this is my impression..first I'm a Boat head..and has been using themvfor the last couple of years..I have discarded my earlier JBLand Philips head phones long back...I'm extremely impressed by boAt 225 edition...just awesome and I am comparing this 255 Bluetooth to the 225..First Bluetooth connectivity is very good and easily covers 10 feet...build is ok but needs a good look...second sound quality may not be like the wired ones (I am slightly disappointed)..voice clarity using microphone is good ( little disappointed) noise cancellation is better compared to 225... finally battery quality is good ..will surely run for 7-9 hours depending on use...bass quality is good..not better than 225..HD sound is impressive..For other Boat heads..if I am wrong let me knowSound quality-3.5/5Build quality-3.5/5Bluetooth connectivity-4/5Noise cancellation-3/5Over all 3.5/5..Boat please improve the quality..for new buyers it's satisfactory but not overwhelming at this price..good luck
I wouldn't recommend this product,2.0,"Do not buy......Okay don't get me wrong, my first impression after getting this was like ""this is the best headphone at this price!"" But now, I don't recommend this....here's the full review...pros:1) Comfort-This is the most comfortable headset I've used, didn't feel uncomfortable even after 6-7 hrs of using.2) This is so light weight, you won't feel anything hanging from your neck.3) Sound and microphone quality is awesome.3)Battery lasted 6-7 hrs on single full charge, that's impressive!Cons:1)Bass, okay if you like bass, then it's pro for you. This has super extra bass! But if you are like me who enjoys all tones of music then it's not for you. Too much bass! I had to use equaliser to use it!2) Elasticity of neck band is so low, it's just like a thick wire. Often slips off your shoulder, that's annoying!3)THIS IS THE REASON YOU SHOULDN'T BUY! THIS THING HAS ZERO RELIABILITY! OFTEN DISCONNECTS ON ITS OWN WITHOUT ANY WARNING! AND THEN YOU HAD TO REMOVE THIS DEVICE FROM PAIRED LISTS ON LAPTOP/PHONE. AND PAIRED IT AGAIN! NOW I HAVE TO DO THIS EVERYDAY! SO SO ANNOYING! TODAY I JUST USED THIS JUST FOR ONE HOUR AND IT HAPPENS! DON'T BUY!4) Range is so poor, five steps from your room, you can't hear anything!"
Received the functional product only after exchange.,4.0,"I am purchasing the boat rockers for the third time. The sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality seem fine. The earphones are long-lasting. The previous ones are working perfectly for more than a year. But I received a faulty product this time. The Bluetooth technology was not working, I couldn't connect it with my phone/tablet/ laptop. Then received the functional product after exchanging. Thankfully Amazon has really good return/ exchange policy."
Good mid range Bluetooth product with great sound quality and battery life,5.0,"Product arrived on time with good packaging, no damages on package.Pros:1. Worth every penny spend on this headset...2. Sound quality is great for this range of product.3. Excellent battery life... i'm using from approx 1 year, still having 3-4 hours of battery back up for continuous usage.4. Bluetooth range is good.Cons:1. Charging port rubber cap is not durable will fall of after 4-5 month of usage.2. No extra ear-hooks provided, as i lost one side hook and its difficult to get same."
Great product ! ***** Service !,5.0,"I am writing this review after 11 months of constant (4-5 hrs) use. In terms of quality it has never failed me.However in the 11th month of use, the right bud stopped working at times. Clearly like most earphones the contact had become loose.Due to pandemic restrictions could get the service station only two days back. Was pleasantly surprised to get a replacement as it was under warranty. No fuss, no hassle. Just registered the complaint online on BOAT website, ticket no was instantly issued and the service center simply gave me the replacement headphones.5 star product, 5 star service."
Worth the cost,4.0,"So I bought this earphone with some suspicions in mind. Wasn‚Äôt very sure that it will work ok. I have used it for a week now and here is my review:Mic quality for calls : Good, if the mic is on your neck, near your mouth, the quality is good. Have received feedback from friends who were on the other end of call.Audio: Audio is quite good, bass is alright, the level you can expect at this cost.Comfort: Comfortable to wear, the earbuds fit perfectly, just the little rubber thing sometimes doesn‚Äôt fit in my ears (guess it is meant for bigger ears)Connectivity: Range is about 5-6ft, not more. Sorry to say this but I have faced this issue with all bluetooth headphones. So I guess either you buy more expensive or stay within this distance of your phone/laptop.Battey: Battery life is surprisingly good. I use it all day with one time full charging. About 6-7 hours."
Am completely dissatisfied this product.,1.0,"Iys very waste product. I don't want to say don't buy this product, It's your wish. This product have low connectivity. Because the producu connevtion music player was struk. While listening songs if get any cal or msg after the songs was discontinued in boat rockers but music player running in mobile. I confirm ly say it's not mobile fault. Other wase sounds quality good. And battery back up also very poor. After complete charge is using continusly will come 4 to 5h. Others wise the battery backup 3 to 4 hours."
Unable to claim warranty in chennai,1.0,"I purchased this headphones after seeing lot of reviews.After 7 months, unable to hear one side. Also noise cancellation is terrible..During corona lockdown,  tried to raise request in Boat website. But after filling all the details, it asked to reach out to service center in chennai.. But due to lockdown restrictions, Service center was closed.So dropped an email to support team but no response.. Even tried to call Boat service helpline but it did not connect to the service representative..When service center opened in chennai, visited directly in person but was shocked to hear they no longer accept Boat products due to payment issues from Boat.. Again tried to contact customer care but unable to connect.Was trying to connect for weeks but was unsuccessful..And on one day, successfully connected to the customer rep. but shocked to hear that the product ran out of warranty (Only 10 days) and they cannot replace. Told him about the service center problem but he didn't care a bit..  He was saying the same thing again and again that product ran out of warranty.Was it my problem that service center was not accepting boat products due to payment issues ?Will never buy Boat products and will suggest all my friends and family to avoid Boat Products..."
budget earphones,4.0,If you are looking for budget earphones under 1000 rs than it us good but still u have choice for boat rockerz 255 and infinly glide 120. I would recommend infinity glide 120 because i have experienced the sound quality of both earphones but i liked the sound quality of infinity glide 120. Everything is perfect.In boat Rockerz i faced 1 issue is with battery backup. Even when you are not using just it is connected with your phone than also it drains the battery while it not seen this type of issue in Infinlty Glide 120. So i would recommend 120.
"Great For Bass Lover, But mic.....",5.0,"I got this earPhone at Rs 999 during the sale, this is my first Bluetooth ear and overall experience is great.Build quality is superb, lightweight, sturdy and stylish.Sound quality is great but not as good as Skullcandy,  JBL, etc but again in this price, it's awesome.Connectivity is super quick, just turn on and it's connected. BT range is not that great, it can be improved.From the battery side, it takes about an hour to juice up for 0%-100% and last for a day(at volume Level 50%-60%).Things that I didn't like is wires are longer than it needs to be, as I already mention BT range is not that great,  mic catches to much noise(no noise cancellation)."
Value for money at this price.,4.0,"Got this product at a deal in Republic sale.It has a decent battery backup. Best thing about this is that you can use this as a great driving earphones. The support is not hard so you can hear it when you lie down on your neck.Sound quality : good, can be betterNoise cancellation : not the bestBass quality : good.Overall, there are great headsets out there that gave far better experience compared to this. But at this price, it gives a tough competition."
Issue with battery and connectivity,1.0,"Battery suddenly drop 0 from 40%.When battery is shows 60% ON button does not work until its plugged into power, post connected with power it get ON and work well even if you remove power cord.Connectivity is good if only used with one device if you are using it with 2 devices it behaves crazy many time or i should say you should only use this with 1 device only.I thought most of the issue may resolve once i am use to it but its not the case now i am using this for more then a week and worst part is now i don't have option to return or replace. Good Luck if this works for you and seems like a Chine's product only to me."
Replace your wired headsets completely,5.0,Excellent battery life. Not an audiophile but my biggest use case of taking office calls while moving has been solved. No ore charging in middle of the day. This has replaced my wired headset completelySound quality is quite good and the new placement of mic and controls allows easy access and better calls clarity.
ISSUE WITH SIZE AND LOOK.,4.0,"over all the neckband is good in quality. like built quality, sound quality,  call voice quality, and battery back up. all are very good. but after using it almost 20 days i found it very long when you are not using it or it is hung around your neck. and the controls and mic is provided separately on right wire of neckband so it makes it little bit heavier while using it for long time. and due to its heaviness it keeps falling while you are moving fast or running.also it doesn't have a premium look so i am thinking of switching it with boat rockerz 385 V2. which have a premium look while wearing it.  you can see both the products in photos."
Just a regular earphone with flaws,3.0,"Pro:Cheap(in terms of price)Basic functionality (Bluetooth connectivity, microphone, basic music listening experience, good for office meetings,calls,Less charge time with good backup(12 hrs)Cons:Bad fit in earsNot for folks who want to listen to loud music for longer durationSometimes difficult to wear for a longer duration"
Product is okay okay,3.0,"I received the product early,1) look wise nice2) sound is good3) Bass is not that good4) Bluetooth connection is good, till a good distance5) Issue is sound breaks some time, and automatically reconnects, I replaced the product with new one, but ithe new one seems to having the same issue."
Survived for a year,4.0,"Product is good, only survived for a year..and I have same complaints as another reviewer so I am just copy pasting his views.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice."
"Don't buy,  worst quality and Service.",1.0,"I am writing this review after using it for 10 months.  It stopped working so i visited the service center in Pune for replacement but Service center experience was really  bad.  I met with Mr Kamal and post inspecting the headphone he told me that there is a gap in the part where battery is placed, hence it has drained out and can't be replaced even though it is under warranty. I am really frustrated as it has taken me more than an hour to reach service center which is a risk in this Covid situation.I can confirm that this gap exist since the time it is delivered and there is no physical damage. To me it's a manufacturing defect,  refer attached photo of the same.Mr Kamal asked me to send a mail to customer care with the photo of the defect and then company will arrange the return.Customer care no is not reachable, sent multiple emails to their support mail ID but no response. It's a low quality Chinese product,  don't buy it."
Not for Calls,3.0,"Been using this for 6 months now. Here are some pros and cons.Pros:1. The sound quality is decent and detailed.2. Build is good, flat wire makes it sturdy.3. Battery lasts for about 6 hours. Full charge takes 10-15 minutes..Cons:1. Mic volume is too low. Don't use for calls.2. Bluetooth-WiFi interference is there.3. There may be delays in sound when you pause and play a video. Happens rarely.4. Causes tinnitus..Better to use it for watching movies and sometimes music."
"Good product, worth buying !",5.0,"It is worth buying and is best in its price range. The battery backup is great, continuous listening gives more than 10 hours. Listening at high volume will drain battery faster and is also not good for ears. So listening at moderate or soft volume will give you more than 10 hours.Noise cancellation and bass quality is excellent. But high frequencies (treble) are not so prominent as it should be, maybe due to increased bass.Charging from 10% to full hardly takes 1 hour using just 1amp charger. Yes fast charging is good.Bluetooth range is quite good and even works beyond 2 walls and around 9 metres. I placed my phone in my living room and went to my bedroom which is after the kitchen, and it worked flawlessly. But when I moved further to my terrace, I faced the intermittent sound issue. It works at more than 10 metres when we keep it in open or near the door so that walls don't interfere.Range issue is also dependent on your handset's Bluetooth range. Some handsets have poor Bluetooth range, so those who are facing range issue should check with some other handset with better Bluetooth range.Best value for money. I am satisfied."
"Only bass , not true music",3.0,"Boat just focuses on bass nothing else, which u can get local made at 300/- I have Sony jbl n Blaupunkt I can hear each n every instruments in the music but boat only drums highlighted,  that too not original sound. Seems like local item in brand name , over priced."
They Rockzz!!,4.0,"Amazon packaging : Not up to the mark, only comes in a plastic ploybag which is the outer bag, no internal protection per se!Durability : looks sturdy, package also says sweat resistant, only delicate part is the charging port flap :PSound : it rockss!! Bass as well as treblesOne good thing is it wont let you increase the sound beyond a threshold via headphones ( u can do it from phone :P)Noice cancellation is awesome.Felt slightly more protruding, needs to be inserted deep into earüëÇ otherwise chances of falling down ( not on the ground btw)Package contains : charging cable 10-15 cm long, 2 pairs of buds of different sizes, warranty card + manualColour : red + black matt finish.Its post delivery feedback so no idea of battery backup, charging, sweat proof. (Will add later)"
Average product,4.0,"I purchased it as a gift.Sound is okay, but the magnet that holds both of the earpieces together is weak.I have OnePlus bullets bass edition headphones. Their quality is far superior. Although to be fair, they're double the price of this product.Go for it if you want an average product that meets the minimum requirements and looks cool."
"Must buy, keeps hands totally free for other work",5.0,Wonderful handsfree bluetooth headphone. Easily connects to any bluetooth device. Is best for train travel as you can keep phone inside bag and still talk/listen to music with no discomfort. Now a days has been very useful during this pandemic for wfh office calls particularly as its wirefree so my hands reamin totally free & dont have to roam with laptop plugged wired headphone. The earplugs are soft and dont bother even after hours of use. Charging lasts for quite 2-3 days so doesnt need to be charged every now and then.
Not Worth the Price,2.0,this is good brand product butit is not up to the mark and features here are also not that satisfyingbass is there but on a Lowe Profile sideHigh and Mids are are clear but sound pretty low one cant hear in a low volumeNeckband strap is also not skin friendly so be careful with that.Overall 1.5/5No Mangnetic on/offno fast chargingno type CDidnt Like the Product.
Ok...nothing great....,4.0,"Well first things first...it's boAt..so don't expect it to perform like BOSE...Bluetooth... I initially had some issues with setting it up with my mobile, but eventually things got sorted out...Sound Quality....it's ok nothing great...can't compare it to any other brand like JBL, Sony etc...because I didn't pay that much...In the Ear fit...now that's the real issue with it...it would never fit properly...no matter how hard I try...keeps falling off...So overall...go for it if Ur budget is less than 1k...otherwise I would suggest to go for a better device from Sony or Samsung or JBL...."
An honest review after a month - Overall a true value for money,5.0,"Well, I have been using these for a month now and the earphones are really good. The sound quality is immensely saturated. I could figure out the bass, treble and other modules separately. The bass is good for people who are not audiophiles. Like if you're not into sound recording or need minute details to grab onto, its perfect for you. I grabbed the deal in 1k though, so it was a nerve cracking deal for me. The battery lasts for 5 to 6 hrs for me even if I stay connected to the phone via Bluetooth without playing any music. It lacks the backup if I keep using it for listening to music for an hour or so and lasts for about 4.5 hrs or so. Mic quality is kinda okay clear but it catches too much of sounds of around you which can irritate the person on the other line. But on an average a great deal to get your hands on."
GOOD BUT NOT BEST,3.0,This is my third boat Bluetooth headset after boat rockerz 235V2 & 255pro..  I think 235v2 is far more better than 255 series. I will provide its quality as per pros and consPros1. Very good wire quality2. Noise  cancellation goodCons1 Sound quality not upto the mark.. 235v2 far more better2. Whenever u receive calls 235v2 starts vibrating which I have not found in 255 series3. Battery backup not goodSince I have used 235 and 255 series I would say go for 235v2 for better sound quality and experience
"Bad battery life, mediocre sound quality and uncomfortable to use",1.0,"The sound quality is mediocre at best but that is not the worst thing about these headphones. The worst thing is the battery life, it simply doesn't works for more than a day. My usage pattern is quite common: listening to a few songs and keeping it connected to the phone for calls.Another irritating thing about boat as a company is that they are not creating earphones(or headphones) which are comfortable to use. The same is true for this earphone (or neckband if you want to be fancy), it will cause pain in your ear after 25-30 minutes of usage.Overall the product is not recommended, as you can get many other earphones in the price range with better battery life. (I think sound quality can't go down)"
Consider This before buying,4.0,Battery Backup kam hai yr.. 6 hours toh kuch bhi nhi hai or pubG k liye thik hai kaafi hadd tak sound bass everything is good but battery Backup as compared to other brand is low... Go for it .. i received a one side not working..but thanks to Amazon hassle-free return policy i am returning it back...If you want Beat or skull candy like quality simultaneously you can compromise on battery Backup go for it... High quality music 6 hour voice call 8hours youtube videos almost 8 to 9 hours...
Worth the money,5.0,Review after 2months of use.Pros1.Good sound quality for the price.2. Adequate bass (my perception)3.Pairs almost instantly4. Volume control works fine5. Ip68 works just fine serves it's purpose during workouts.6.Magnetic ends of ear buds serves the purpose to keep the headphones around neck without ear buds swaying around when not in use.ConsBattery back up could have been better. Lasts for almost a week on full charge with daily 1hr usage.Final verdictOverall value for money.
Comfirt Quality Regular usage.,4.0,"After a week almost i would say that its most comfirtable and light weight.Appearance is ok sporty touch and black colour looks professional too..Comfirt in Ear, non slipy and proper fitting in Ear gives good noise cancellation.Sound are good at vocal and music both.. Bass is as per other good haedphone and not so so much extra as mentioned here in other reviews and product discription.Batery is ok for mderate use. Charge every day if use is more then  4- 5 hour in a dayIts very very  good for routine listening of music and talk, but if you looking for party type sounds like other big headphone then its not suitableAnd so is orice to be kept around 800-1000 thats too also due to brand"
"Good quality, good price, in good range.",4.0,"Well ...Writing true review after using it for 7 continous days, ..Product quality is good as well as awesome. Also the sound quality is more punchy as well as bassy. Battery is good . It works for around 6 to 8 hours in continous full volume. Also the buds are on lighter side so easy to wear. Microphone is on a distance so some how difficult for microphone usage. Other things are good and best."
POWER  NOT ON AFTER 2 DAYS....and A Blue light always on...,1.0,"Let me tell you about the product in Details,1. Sound Quality is good. It is harmless for ears. Not too loud but traffic noise can't disturb you while listening music.2. Look is awesome but wires are too lengthy.3. Battery Backup 'WAS' awesome. Six to seven hours after 1 or 1.30 hours chargingBUT4. Product is not CHARGING AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS OF PURCHASE. And it is not acceptable. That's why the rating is ONE (lesser than one is not available though)I will change my ratings and review too but after the replacement or refund against this product.And one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes."
Value for money product,5.0,Sound quality is very good even a person without music knowledge will definitely enjoy the musicNoise cancellation is decent standardBass quality is excellentSometimes due to interference with electro magnetic effect. It music gets bit messyBattery life is about 4 hrs and it's really to hang aroundFeels weight less on neck
They are not Okay,2.0,"The problem is its battery life.. worstI had boat rockerz 270 which worked so well once charged.. also.. it has a very abrupt behaviour when discharged..I had kept it on charging for good 3 hours and when turned on.. it started saying battery low in 5 mins .. then switched off.I put it on a car usb charger for 15 mins hardly n it said 100%.The sound quality is just ok... Not sure of its real or fake coz its just like any other local earphone brand.You will start feeling headache / ear ache if you are using it for long time.Also the charger provided with the product is cheap, low quality and the wire is very small in length.The 2 magnets are not quite working..Only good things about the earphone:Lightweight and good color.The earbuds are fine as they fit in and do not get off easily, in case you go on a running or something while these are on."
best headphones at this price,5.0,"I'm writing this after using nearly 6 months. So you can really trust me.Pros:1. Superb battery backup, It takes 30 min max to fully charged, and drained after 3-4 days of usage ( avg. 30-35 hrs backup)2. Designed good, enough comfortable3. Very good sound quality4. Type C port charging availableCons:1. It can better its noise cancellation, but I really don't find any difficulty.2. It can be little bit better in sound quality but, for daily users for office, phone calls, for casual music listening, its good, may be some specific music lovers and who need more qualitative sound may have better option.Thank you."
After 1 and half month use this is my review,5.0,"Awsome ear phones in bluetooth, sound is excelent even drive through phone call is also excellent. This is my review after 1 and half month use1. Sound - it's excellent, it's clear and bass is like dolby sound with max noise cancellation.2.batter- i used for 20hr *4days . i got 4 days charge3. Mic - while driving we can speak clearly there is no disturbanceMore over this bluetooth rockerz 255 + proIs very nice but if they gave magnetic bluetooth off like one plus it will be great"
Go for it....,4.0,"Good Bluetooth in the ear headphones....Sound quality is decent....may seem a little thin, takes time to get used to, but definitely not bad or poor.Battery life too is decent( around 5-6 hrs) when connected.Build quality is good, though you need to b a little careful.All in all a VALUE FOR MONEY deal ( especially sweet since I got it at an attractive deal price of INR 999 during the Great Indian Amazon Sale)."
Budget Bluetooth earphones,4.0,"I had been using it for more than week now. 1) Audio quality is good,2) When I put it around neck, I don't feel it is there.3) But for some reason after long hours of usage ears started paining. I removed ear loop hooks and changed the ear phone tips to smallest size. Now I am able wear them for little longer.4) During call I checked with caller about noise and call audio quality. They didn't complain.5) 3 buttons can be felt easily when you are wearing them. Accepting calls is easier with middle button and other 2 buttons are volume up and down bottons.6) With long press and saying ""OK google"", google assistant can be activated."
Pathetic Customer service.,1.0,I purchase this on 6Aug'2020 and within couple of months one of the earphone stopped working. Initially BOAT use to provide door-to-door pickup Service for replacement. But now they expect to visit Service Center which is almost 25-30km from my place. Is it fair to spend 300-400 bucks going to service center for a replacement of a product which costed 900 Rs.  Tried to contact their Customer Service but every time they disconnect the call or ask to mail them on their email Id. I have email as well but no response. Really pathetic experience. NEVER EVER BUY BOAT PRODUCTS... please share the review with as much folks...
The best I have ever had.,5.0,"I am very impressed by the product. Everything from the sound to the build to the battery is excellent.It is going to be my everyday companion for sure!Plus with the complete trust that I have on boat customer care, warranty and replacement policies , this product will last you endlessly."
Amazing is just a word,5.0,"I knew Boat was good but this exceeded all my expectations.1. The sound is amazing, better than some.wired headsets that I have.2. The highs and lows are captured perfectly.3. Easy to pair and operate, simple and easy; even kids can operate it.4. Been using it for my walks and use it for both phone n music. I keep my phone in my pant poclet and there is no loss of range.5. Have used it for 2 hours and the battery charge is still on."
Awesome is the word for these Rockerz!!!,5.0,The Boat rockerz are awesome. That are perfect for use while running/jogging. They are comfortable enough that you wouldn‚Äôt even feel they're plugged in. Sound is clear and loudness is enough even in crowded areas. Phone calls are good and no irregularities found in voice reception. Battery lasts for over 10 hours even after constant usage. Charging is fast enough. Overall I'm fully satisfied with the rockerz.
Budget friendly good for casual use.,4.0,"So it's been some time I've been using these about a month I guess, and I can say I'm fully content with these, sound quality is good, they are durable, light in weight, fit in ear just there, bass is a bit overrated but I think for me it's ok, voice on call clear enough. So overall a good make all in all, find the below review to check out and decide if these fit your specs for a perfect buy.So when you unbox these quite a good box and you can see through the plastic covering the headphones, once you open the box you'll find some docs such as the warranty card, and the boat pamphlet, and some other doc's related to boat.Make - I think the make seems to be quite good in this price, when I wore them for the first time I couldn't feel the headphones around my neck then, they've just managed to make them light but still heavy enough to sustain around your neck, you'll find less buttons and the best part for me is that they have provided a C-type charging socket which was just a Cherry on the cake for me as I possess a One plus. They've taken care that it doesn't get itchy around your neck and also you keep enjoying your music experience so great work on that front, the wires are a bit long coz they are connected to the end of the heavy plastic material, and I'm afraid I might just pop off one the wires if my activities are a bit aggressive, so I hope they work on that part, the erabuds fit okay in the ear I can feel a heaviness in ear when I wear, them, plus the smallest of the rubber tips just seem the medium size to me maybe because of the external part being bigger in size than the internal part that goes in-ear. So I'm not satisfied with the earbud part that goes in-ear but all in all I think they've done a pretty good job to provide the best quality in this price range.Music and call quality - On the music front I think they've done a decent job, the earphones a loud and packed with extra bass, now what happens is if you are connected and you get a call it just bangs in-ear which could be dangerous if your phone ring volume is full, they are just too loud so it's difficult to guage other music fronts and beats, as far the bass is concerned it's just wow if you're listening to bass packed music. So if you are looking for that detailed music breakdown it's a heartbreak there, and I also happen to get a lag for about .1 or .2 seconds which means gamers I won't recommend these to you, but if you're just looking for casual use I think you can just go for it.Noise cancellation - Actually people have misunderstood the noise cancellation funda in these, so there is no extra feature or a button where you press and get the Noise cancellation mode active, so then what does it mean, whatever they have advertised that is partly correct yes it has noise cancellation but not that at par, it does a pretty decent job though, if you're wearing these then you might wanna press them into your ear to get better results for the noise cancellation part.Price - I got these in a sale price of ‚Çπ1499 on Amazon, so I feel that's a great buy in such a budget, the original price appears to be ‚Çπ1999 however you'll find them at ‚Çπ1700 - ‚Çπ1800 on Flipkart, do remember to check your prices before you buys these.All in all a wonderful product if you're engaged in calls, and casual browsing and streaming videos online, good enough for listening to music, I would suggest a best buy budget friendly."
"Good sound quality ,Partial noise cancellation,  Terrible mic",3.0,"Pros : *Good Sound quality* Partial Passive noise cancellationCons :*terrible in outgoing audio.We cannot use the mic whatsoever. If u try to record a voice note with this , or call someone  , either it will not be heard at all or will sound like you're standing a mile away even if the mic is right next to your mouth.If it's only for hearing music , go ahead , but don't rely on the mic."
A bit disappointed with this ...,3.0,"This is my third boat headphone and unfortunately this one was a disappointment. The previous rockerz versions had the ability to be used while it was charging, which was something that I really cherished.Not to mention the annoying ""Maximum volume"" voice when the volume level is at max. It should have been a simple feedback (a small beep would be great) and not the entire sentence which blocks what the end user is trying to say, making the use of this in meetings a bad thing.Hope boat addresses these issues in the next release."
Seriously amazing battery life with decent sound & call quality.,5.0,"I basically needed a good enough headphone with long battery life.So far, I've never had to hear ""oops battery low"" in this one even after using it and also leaving it on standby for 4-5 days. Fast charge juice it up to full within 15-20 min after i put it on charge from ‚âà80% battery.Sound quality is decent enough, bass is awesome, and they're quite loud as well.Call quality is not bad either.With Bluetooth 5.0, it won't get disconnected if you roam around in another room with your device lying in a different one.At Rs 1500, it's value for money if you want a longggg battery life and decent sound quality."
Lousy headphones,1.0,"I primarily use this headset for my daily bike ride to farm which is full of pot holes , trenches and bad roads. When I listen to music I tend to forget these obstacles and focus on my day to day goals. Day one use was okay. However now whenever I plug this with any of my Bluetooth device, I hear screeching sound just like old days mobile network coverage sound. I tried changing my mobile with other however problem continues. Also if you add another 500rs to will get jbl ones better than this boat rocker. Absolutely waste of money."
Serves my purpose,3.0,"I bought these neck bands for one purpose only, for hands free calling. I will say that the neck band serves this purpose. I have never used this for listening to music, and hence do not know what is sound quality, when listening to music. I generally use only the right ear piece, as it serves the purpose of making hands free call, leaving my left ear and hand free to connect with intercom calling, which may happen simulteneously.I did not purchase ear buds, as i was afraid of loosing them within a day or two. these being neck bands, they stubbornly hand around my neck, and hence chances of loosing them is very less. audio is interrupted most of the times, and I cant hear the call continuously. but I am not able to verify, whether this is attributed to service provider or neck band. but as of now, I havent got a single breakfree call. each and every call has broken sound.somehow these do not connect with my laptop, however have I tried. that does not go well. fortunetly I have a 3.5mm ear phones, which serve the purpose. but these neckbands do not connect with laptop"
It's better than expected....,5.0,"At first I want to mention battery life, believe me I've heard music whole night. Next morning when I woke up with the music in my ear. I quickly check the battery, it was 51% remaining.Sound quality is also awesome with rocking base.Driver cabinets is also small enough to set it up for helmet too...No disconnecting problem so far..."
Won‚Äôt support the basic operations,2.0,"The hooks and ear buds comes off always and very uncomfortable design, the wires are too long sometimes you might feel you‚Äôll using a wired earphone. The sound quality dropped to low after using it for six months I‚Äôm giving this review. You should be very careful cause of the delicateness of the product. Need to hold it for longer to change the song it‚Äôs even better in normal cheap products.The only thing I liked I can use it over IOS or Android or any other model.It‚Äôs Bluetooth coverage is very limited just inside the single room."
Value for Money,5.0,This product was recommend to me by a friend. Good product and connects easily. Good sound quality and also has long lasting battery. Sometimes I don‚Äôt have to charge it for even 2 days after heavy use. Sometimes while speaking on the the person I am speaking to is not able to hear me. Over all a good product and value for money. Will recommend this product.
Annoying Hiss/Clicking Noise,1.0,"Excellent pair of earphones especially for the price of 899-999 (on sale). It has very good range, great sound, IPX7 rating and CVC for clear calls. Unfortunately the right earbud produces a constant hiss/click noise when idle which is extremely interrupting and annoying. Upon reading many other users have also reported the same. Game of Luck I guess."
Decent pair BT earphones under 2k,4.0,"I'll break down my review into 4 parts : Sound quality, noise cancellation and calls(mic), battery and ergonomicsSound quality:For the price range of 1.2k, ( I got it for 900 rupees during 2019 Dasara sale ) the quality of sound is pretty crisp. There is a slight overtone to Bass while the other elements are balanced. Personally, I think this balance is perfect. Given the pricing, I'd rate 5/5 for sound quality.Noise cancellation:For the pricing range, I'd say the noise cancellation is pretty decent. Somewhere close to half volume your noise cancellation works seamlessly while listening to music. On the other hand, when I'm on calls, the noise cancellation is pretty poor. People often tell me that they're clearly able to listen to all the talk and noise and honking etc, from the background but not my voice. So I have to pull the mic closer to my lips to be audible enough to eliminate background noise. So, I'd give 3/5 for noise cancellation.Battery:I play music at a pretty low volumes (some 3 button presses lower than half volume) So, the battery can easily last upto 6 hrs. If I'm watching a movie or TV series, it'll last for 7-8 hours. The charging time is pretty nominal. I charge it from 6:45 am to 8:15 am and it would have gone from 0 to full charge. You could charge it with a 2.1 A adapter for a much quicker charge but I don't know if the earphones can handle that current without getting damaged in the long run (read the institution manual). So, at this pricing, I'd give battery a 4/5Ergonomics:I must say, my favourite part is the magnetic lock. It's convenient and you can simply wear it around your neck like a necklace. It's easy to tuck it under your collar and keep it locked when not using. Looks sturdy though I don't wish to test it ! One disadvantage would be that that wire is a little too long and that wasn't necessary. It's bulky and unlike other BT earphones, you can't throw them in a bag, you'll need to be careful where you put it. If the ear hooks are positioned correctly, you should have no pain around the ear cartilage while wearing them for long durations. I wear it 2.5 hrs a day to work and I rarely feel irritated or pain around the ear.  So, I'd give ergonomics and overall comfort a 3/5Combining the ratings for all the above mentioned parameters, the overall eating turns out to be a 4/5 for this pricing which is pretty decent I'd say. Whenever it's on offer (under 1000 bucks) and you want a pair of BT earphones, simply go for it. I can absolutely vouch for it."
Good choice neckband,5.0,"The neckband ar very good. The quality of neckband is very awesome, the cables the earbuds and the neckband are looking premium. Tge sound is very loud and bass is high. The sound is ballanced. The noise cancellation is very good.when we plug the earphones the noise cancellation works very properly.The charging is very fast. When i open the box the earphones are only 40% charged and after 5 to 10 minutes i plug tge earphones for charging and after 40 to 50 minutes the neckband are full charged. The one thing that disappointed me is that the playback time of neckband. And the mic is also very good. The Bluetooth connectivity is also good."
It's a good buy for less than 1000,4.0,"Pros1. Good quality sound and good bass2. Nice noise cancellation.3. After 2 hours of listening, small discomfort starts in ear, but compared to other in ear headphones this is lot better.4. For on call, u need to speak to Mike and it's very clear in close environment didn't test in openCons1. The band slightly loose for running, I am tall and broad but when I run its keeps on shaking near the shoulders and neck.2. In call if you talk with face facing away from Mike call quality deteriorates"
Its Good if you got Lucky,5.0,"I exchanged my bluetooth Headphones coz They were so Poor in Call Quality and so tanks to amazon they exchanged it within 2 days and the new headset works fine now , in terms of sound or bass quality i was satisfied with the one that i recieved earlier as well, noise cancellation is what youll find at this price is not as good as this one has so yes, the defective one i recieved i was unsatisfied with it but the new onwe i exchanged made me feel Value for my money"
Not the best wireless earphone if you are looking for awesome sound quality,3.0,"I got this earphone on a Prime Day Sale for 999 INR only. Such a great bargain.So I have been using this for over a month now and this is what I have to say:Pros:1. Price. Get it on a Prime Day Sale or wait for it to go on a Lightning Deal.2. Great Noise Cancellation. I have used it in various environment staring from overcrowded bus to setting beside loud sound and the noise cancellation has never failed. It blocks almost 90% of the incoming surrounding noise which is a great plus point.3. Great battery life. 16+ hours of listening.4. Quite high volume.5. Great form factor and the magnets to hold the earphones together is quite strong.6. Boat provides various ear-cups of different sizes.7. One tap Google assistant.8. The wireless range is no doubt great.Cons:1. Terrible bass. My 350 INR Boat wired earphones have better bass than this one.2. Volume could have been a bit higher.3. Not the greatest sounding earphones. Opt for a wired one if wireless is not a necessity.Conclusion:If you are on a tight budget and looking for a wireless earphone, then this might be it for you but if you want a great sounding earphone with nice bass, then look for other options. Boat is a company which you can trust. They also have a great customer support. Props for that."

Connectivity issues after 4 months of usage.,3.0,"Purchased on 20-June-2019BoatRockerZ wireless earphone has started giving connectivity issues since this morning. Now it often gets disconnected and after a few seconds it again connects. Sometimes I have to turn off and turn on to pair againInitially I thought it was because the device was away from the headset and I started holding closer. After several trials, I gave up thinking that could be because I haven't put the earphone on charge last night. But after entire day of charging, when I connect to listen the same issue recurrs.I am now looking for my abandoned wired earphone."
Quality product from Boat,4.0,"After using for a week, it's value for money & there is no doubt about it. I basically wanted these for making calls which it is totally capable of without a complaint, so I am satisfied. Sound quality during calls is very good. Looks beautiful, has good built quality & the finally the main quality ie. Sound & here sound quality is pretty good, gives a thundering Bass at above 50% volume & overall very enjoyable listening."
Stopped working in a week,1.0,It just stopped working after giving off a static sound in 2weeks. Boat speakers used to be good but now with its rampant orders across the country and staunch mass manufacturing facility it forgot to encase it's products with the quality it was once renowned for. Terribly disappointed. Never again will I buy another product from boat.
HORRIBLE,1.0,"The product purchased was working fine, but after a month only one side of the headphone started malfunctioning. Although the product is covered under 01 years warranty, No one is responding to the complaints. Customer care number is not working, emails are not getting replied, online complaint status is on progress mode since past 10-15 days."
"Mic is not good, background noise",2.0,Writing after a week‚Äôs use....If you are looking for an earphone to make phone calls forget this one. The mic picks the background noise. The listener at the other end of the call hears more of the background noise than the speaker‚Äôs voice. I bought this one to take long office calls. Turned out to be a bad choice.Battery life is good.Sound quality of the earpiece is good. So if your purpose is only listening & not taking phone calls this is an ok one. But for that purpose I believe you may find a cheaper one.
Perfect companion in all circumstances.,4.0,"Built quality, Sound Quality, Noise Cancellation, Voice commands, Call quality everything is just perfect BUT biggest drawback is Battery backup. When 60% left and you start using within few mins it directly falling to zero. Which is really pessimistic. However it takes couple days of moderate usage to reach 80% so overall it's a bang for buck. I strongly recommend to go for this sportive wireless headsets."
Amazing product at affordable cost,4.0,"Writing review after 4 months of usage.Instant connectivity, however i find the power on and off voice notification irritating.Charging and charge hold is good. Gives 3 hours approx. talktime in 20 mind charge. I found this useful.  Full charge gives atleast 6 hours of usage (used it more than couple of times when watching series).Noise cancellation is good, voice clarity is nice loud and clear, however is sometimes bassy like the person from other end is talking in a hall., Maybe something to do with the network.Music is above average. Had given 5 stars for music and bass but after 2 months of usage i found the volume drop i.e. even when setting the volume level at it highest level, the output is not that heavy as it was in first two months. Though checked all my phone settings, nothing has changed.Bluetooth connectivity, and range is seamless and fantastic.Overall a good product at the price offered. Surviving the lockdown using this for my office calls and evening movie time.Will recommend this product who is looking for an above average quality at an affordable cost. Don't expect too much for music, for voice calling a best available product."
"It's great 'but', Not actually!",4.0,"No doubt about the product. The quality of music and it's bass will never disappoint you. The only thing that is extremely disappointing is it's Bluetooth connectivity, So it comes with Bluetooth 4.2. You can never enjoy music in an open area where it's airy, Cuz that creates hell lot of disturbances while listening to music, I have used Bluetooth 4.2 earphones before this is the worst experience I ever had, The audio stops for more than 3 seconds if it's really windy. And it keeps on interrupting. You can only have a great experience when you're in a room. Plugging in the earphones and riding a bike is your worst decision (first of all it's not safe, 2nd of all, You can't hear a thing of the music or a voice in a call). So I suggest people to go for Bluetooth 5.0 only! If you want seamless experience. I'm not sure boAt has any device that has Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity."
Best in Class Bluetooth Earphones Under 1K,5.0,"These are best Bluetooth Earphones available in market till now if you grab it in 1K in any sale of Amazon.*The Sound Quality is fabulous.*The body of band is plastic build but it's very durable enough,no need to think about it's toughness.*It fits in üëÇ perfectly without giving pain to your ears.*The connectivity is also decent, it can pair with 2 devices simultaneously (laptop & smartphone) , whenever you turn it on, if the last paired device is near to it, it will connect to it quickly.*It supports Google assistant or any other you use in your smartphone.*And guess what it even works pretty well with your keypad phoneüòÖ.*Battery life is decent as well (will easily last for a working day on a full charge)*Bass is definitely the best in this one.So if you are looking forward to buy a Bluetooth Earphone for the first time , you should definitely without any thought go wmfor this one carrying the Brand name of BOAT & many good user reviews/experiences like of mine."
"Amazing sound, awesome connectivity, disappointing battery",3.0,"Undoubtedly quick Bluetooth connectivity.Portable light and affordableVoice quality is good, liked the neon colourSome issues I wanna discuss in detail1. Earbuds don‚Äôt fit in ears, there‚Äôs no extra pair of earbuds lock, you loose them quick, it‚Äôs kinda cheap material2. There‚Äôs no noice cancelled support and pre fed boat rockers dialogue are annoying3 pretty bad battery! Doesn‚Äôt stand whole day gets drained in like 2 hours of constant music playingRest everything is fine! Battery is disappointing"
A decent bluetooth neckband from boat,3.0,"Here is my review for boat Rockerz 255 pro ( blazing yellow ) . Got it for Rs. 930. Its original price is 1399. If you are getting it below 1k go for it otherwise its not worth it. If you're in a tight budget then only go for boat . Otherwise go for brands like realme, oppo, Mi, OnePlus, Dizo etc.  Okay here is my in depth review explanation.1. Build quality - 3/5.The neckband is made of decent quality plastic. The ear phones are made of metal and has magnets to stick together without falling.2. Sound quality - 4/5.Im satisfied with the sound quality . It produces good bass , and clear vocals even at high volume. No issues with it. It supports AAC which is not that good, doesn't feel the difference.3. Battery life - 4/5.Battery life is good. Gives around 5-6 hours at 80% volume. which is pretty good.4. Call quality - 4/5 .Im not a person who take much calls in this neckband  Call quality is good and nothing to complaint. Both ends are clear.Pros-1. Sound quality is good.2. Latency is very minimal.  In BGMI and most of the games the latency is less and playable. Nothing too bad to complain . The gameplay is playable with it.3. Battery life is good. And charging is also pretty fast . Can be charged in 1 hour.Cons -1. For the price 1399 its totally not worth it.2. The wire length from the neckband to the earphones is a bit short . If you are in a situation to raise your head the band will lift and give a uncomfortable feel.3. These band is more than a year old since its launch so its a bit outdated.4.  No call vibration alert. If you are a person who takes lot of calls you need to reach the phone to know who is calling.5. Joining the earbuds will not pause the content which is a bummer at this price point.  Hope this review will help you to decide . Will update if any good or bad things found about the band. Thank you for reading."
Didn't Even Last 4 Months!,1.0,"These earphones are of pathetic quality. These got delivered to me in August 21 and I am writing this review in November 21. The issue right now is that they get switched off automatically again and again while you are in the middle of a call, watching a video or listening to a song and it is so annoying. The company that seems to be manufacturing this seems to be just interested in fleecing the customers with a low quality product, so its my request to anyone reading this review to not to buy this product."
Very good for a normal user,5.0,"If you are person who cares less about high quality precision bass, treble, outputs and are looking for a neat and practical wireless headset, this is for you.This is such a neat no nonsense headset. The bluetooth connectivity is pretty quick, the range is good enough (keep your phone and move around, it works well. The drop was imminent beyond a good 30ft. It happens with most of the budget gadgets. But why walk a point beyond?This was bought for my FIL. He enjoys it. It's easy for him. Light, easy to fit in ears. Nice quality sound. Good mic. Good battery life. So it's a go-go!"
Fantastic,5.0,"Boat Rockerz 255Pro+Pros:-1. The bass is amazing and the quality is excellent. The 10mm drivers work really well.Music is just pleasant to hear and the vocals aren't suppressed which is a good thing.Signature Boat sound quality, bass is the best, mids are well balanced2. Call quality is excellent.. the mic on this headset is good and gets the job done3. It's very comfortable and light weight4. The quality is excellent and the wires feel really sturdy. Probably the best quality that you can get at this price..5. And the battery is just mind-blowing!!It's so awesome that this headset is unstoppableI thought that battery might not be this good bcz of how good the music output was, but no prob, this headset is an easy 2-3 day machine even on heavy usageYour phone will run out of battery before this oneüòÇ6. Bluetooth 5, the connection is seamless and you can literally connect to 2 devices simultaneously which is amazingI can switch between 2 phones or 1 phone and laptop7. IPX7 rating- just don't worry about it's water resistance, it's beyond amazing, best for workouts8. Fast charging- it supports Type-C charging which is a relief. And it charges very fast with my phone's fast charger.Like they claimed, 10-15min charge is enough for a day..9. The pricing- you get so many features in one headset but the pricing is really mind-blowingI got this for Rs.1100/- in sale but blindly consider this product as the best under Rs.2000/-I'd buy this even if it was priced Rs.2000/-That is how good it is..10. Noise cancellationIt comes with Passive noise cancellation and it's goodCons:-1. Treble isn't the best (it's a typical boat headset problem, not the fault of this particular headset, so don't worry, I'm just mentioning it)It's good but not the best and not much people care about it..2. No app supportI wish it had app support like realme headsetsVerdict:-This has so many pros and it works fantastic. I can't believe how good this product is. A reputed brand and a fabulous product..Just go for this one..Thanks boat for such an amazing productTotally worth the money.."
Not good not bad (but they are lying about the water resistance),3.0,"Pros- Very good battery life, good bass for bass lovers, good design, fits good.Cons- Audio lag in high-end games, can't handle even a drop of sweat, that ear fin thing is way too annoying, it not smooth to connect to a second device if you are already connected to your phone, the buttons are user friendly.Conclusion- If you are looking for a gaming earphones or earphones for running, workout this is not the one, if you are looking for something casual earphones, a long battery life, bass lover you can go for it but KEEP IT AWAY FROM WATER OR SWEAT. THEY ARE TOTALLY LYING ABOUT WATER RESISTANCE."
Sound quality is best and clear.,3.0,"I am using this earphone for the last 1 week and so far everything is working absolutely fine. I really enjoyed listening to music and it is comfortable to wear for a long time. The build quality is ok. It is all plastic except for earbuds.The sound quality is really good and if you are a bass lover then you are gonna enjoy it. Overall, it is the best wireless earphone to buy.P.S - I will update my review after long-term use.Update - There are some issues with it (2 Months review).1- There is a hissing sound that is very irritating and you will hear it clearly during night time because there are no environmental sounds at that time.2- It sometimes gets disconnected while using and sometimes don't get automatically connected at all.(Already paired)3- If you are connected to one device (let's say Laptop/Desktop), then you can't connect it to another device like a phone. (Both the devices are already paired. I am connecting them one by one and dual pairing is giving issues.) It gets connected on vice versa. (First phone then Laptop)"
good deal at this price,4.0,"I got it @ 999/- on the day after i ordered it. Sound quality is not the best but good, extra bass is available which somehow destroy the lows and mids. but decent at this price range. battery back up is also good. i have not charged it,already used it 3-4 hours at mid volume. Call quality is also good.overall a good package from Boat, you can go for it.only con is the bluetooth range. it is very disappointing. if you roam about in the house keeping your phone on your room the connection gets lost!otherwise it is good overall!"
Buy if you can compromise a little for sound quality,3.0,The headphones are good overall but not in every aspect that it offers.Pros:1. yes the battery life. Mind blowing.2. Noise cancellation is good. (or at least i am satisfied with it)3. Lightweight4. Good feedback from buttons5. Good bluetooth range.Cons:1. Not so great sound quality (compared to oneplus) a minute hiss and distortion at high volume levels2. Takes time to switch between devices4. You feel the latency if you observe for it5. Doesn't support aptX as per claim atleast not on my poco f1 which supports aptX and aptxHDOverall i won't say its VFM but a compromised product for the price.
Excelent bluetooth earphones for the price range,5.0,"1. The sound quality & noise cancellation is really good2. Microphones are of very good quality, the person I'm talking to on phone can clearly hear me without any distortion or noise.3. The range is about 10 meters, & the earphone & microphones work even when there are multiple walls in between.4. The battery is quite good, so far I have seen the earphone gives 5-6 hours backup with a single full charge on conference calls. I have not used the microphone till it gets fully discharged, so not sure of the complete battery backup duration.5. The ear guides are a little uncomfortable & creates pain on the ears, but after removing the ear guides I found them very comfortable."
Nice product,5.0,"Very nice product. Good battery backup. I get almost 4 day's on continuesly connected to my phone for calls. For full charge it takes around 1.5 hrs but if you charge for 10 min it lasts you for more than 4 hours continues use for music. For calls noise cancellation is not good, your caller will able to here other person's voice too. But Overall good product."
Good,5.0,I am using it for more than a month now.It voice not the best in quality when heard on the receiver end.Good battery back up. I recharge once in 3 days. Excellent music quality. Good bass.But overall very much satisfied with the product. Good service also I think(Their customer service team also contacted me to check about the product)
3 star,3.0,"The range of Bluetooth is very low. It does not work properly if you are in a different room. Sound quality is good however, during calls there is fluctuation. The person onnthe other end of a call always complain about the irritating noise coming from the earphone, which I cannot hear. To confirm it, I asked my friend to record the call. After listening btobthe recorded call, I could hear some sound like tak-tak-tak. My colleague does not have this issue though. I cannot use it for a longer period of time since my ears start having pain.Otherwise, it a good earphone. Good to buy at this rate."
Returned my Product...,2.0,"I really rely a lot on reviews while buying stuffs. So I take efforts in writing one to help others too.Well, I was actually blowed out by the near to lakh positive reviews of this headphone. So ordered it without 2nd thot, faced two issues,1. Bluetooth range wasnt satisfactory and 2. Constant disturbance. I assumed that may be mine is defective as I still relied on reviews I had read. So I ordered a replacement. Sadly the replacement looked like a refurbished item with no proper seal and packing. Anyways it was the same as I felt on my 1st boat.Additinally, I ordered sony WIC200 headphones. The experience was different. Advantage was good range of connectivity and soft sound on ears.So to summarise, in a line for people who like bass, mostly want to use it for movies or hear music, BOAT is best in range and for people who want good call range and soft sound for music n movies may like to buy WIC200 Sony."
Very durable product,5.0,"very durable and long lasting headphones ,value for money a trustable product. Even have tried many expensive headphones I want to plant to get this for a temporary purpose. Now it became my daily use headphones.It's amazing that how board can give search quality product for such reasonable rate you can trust this I am using this for almost a year now it's so good and very believable and durable I used to even sleep with this for many nights it never had any breaks are cuts till nowrefuse headset very preferable for gym and other physical activities"
The ‚ÄúBoat‚Äù experience !!,5.0,"I feel they are the best in the business. They have come out with exceptional quality, awesome product at the exact right price point. Awesome accoustic experience is what Boat provides and i would go so far to say that they are the Bose of their price point. I have been using Boat rockerz 250 in the past and those lasted well over 3 years while delivering exceptional music experience throughout. The battery started to give way after 2 yrs but that is expected of all these products. The 255 have better sound quality in terms of bass, accoustic, treble if compared to the 250.The wire is a bit too long for my liking but that‚Äôs probably cause i had gotten used to the short wire of the 250.I am sure these will again last me well over 2 years. My brother didn‚Äôt listen to me and bought noise shotz and he is regretting his decision now. Poor sound quality, battery quality, connection issues are some of the issues with the noise shotz.Everyone should give them a try once.I had skullcandy before and they were replaced by the company 4 times in the first year while the warranty was active and i had to throw them away after the warranty expired as the 5th piece also malfunctioned. The Boat experience though has been an awesome soundblowing experience."
Buzzing sound,3.0,Sound quality is not so good .. always a distorted sound is the background like a radio ....bass is super great ..but that buzzing sound make it distorted and yes they cause pain on the ears and then into the head ....
Boat head,4.0,"First of all..,If you are looking for a good Bluetooth headset go for this one.The product is amazing and very pocket friendly, thanks to amazon for the discount and speedy delivery. Was Not very sure about boat headset but this one surprised me..Battery backup is awesome and also displays the battery level on the mobile phone to which is connected.Amazing bass quality and refinement in the audio clarity overall a very decent and good product. Last but not least this carries one year warranty."
Genuine Reasons to go for Boat Rockers 255 pro,5.0,"The product is really appealing in its design.Its weightless. The colors in which the earphones comes are really pleasing. Easily chargeable and holds charge for more than 6 to 7 hours.Its highly user friendly. The earphones are well positioned in affordable and normal price range by Boat. I am able to experience high quality sound. It's highly useful for fitness freaks. In my opinion, I would definitely suggest this product to experience immersive, good quality sound during intense workouts. It really keeps me upbeat and focus on my morning walks and intense gym sessions in evening effectively....!"
worst sounding headphone with long battery life,1.0,do not buy this headphones expecting good sound quality its a cheap headphone built with big battery.i have used oppo enco m1 and found it extremly good in case of sound quality but it has latency problems.boat is good in dual paring and latency deparment and not to mention the big battery but boat are the worst sounding headphone in history of mankind
It's incredibly fantastic!!!,5.0,"I've been using it for over a week now, almost continuously. It really lasts for 40 hours. To my surprise, as they claim, 10 minutes of charging really make it available for the next 10 hours. Before this, I've used many Bluetooth, including JBL, Sony but this one works as it claims. I'm more than happy. It's really worth the price. Rather I would say it's a steal. Noise cancellation works well. I would definitely recommend it."
Product has with wrong sound frequency details in manual with marketing gimmick.,3.0,Product mentioned in manual it is 20hz to 20khz but it's actually it's not I am sound engineer I know what's the real frequency of 20hz to 20hz. Product actually have bass boosted you can't listen more than 1 or 2 hours. In the end product is sturdy but with wrong sound frequency as mentioned. So I am not satisfied with it. Bass lover can loved it. But my experience with this product I didn't recommend who Love overall music presence.
If you want to buy a Boat bluetooth earphone then you go for it .,4.0,Sound quality is amazing......battery quality is very high. I purchase this bluetooth earphones 5 days ago till now it's charge lvl is 80%....it's so amazing. Only one problem is extra earbuds feels or make irritating in ear otherwise all is good till now  .Boat service center also helpful......it's depends on location wise....if you Are  out of area ( service center ) then boat provide you door to door replacement.
F**** Notification killing my ears.,2.0,"I dont why they are making such a loud(FULL VOLUME) notification for each and everything like.""You are connected to rockers 255 pro"""" you are Disconnected/ connected/ ready to pair"" at full volume.Dame it. not satisfied due to this issue."
Value for money,5.0,"Just got this and I must say that the build quality is great. Coming to the sound it has really good bass. Can't comment of the battery yet as I just got it. I will update the review later after checking the battery backup.Edit: So, after using it for few days, the battery easily lasts for a day and half a per my usage which includes 1-1.5 hrs of music, one movie (1.5-2hrs) and one episode of Tv series (40-50mins). I end a with 40% battery left as per above usage."
Good Device,5.0,"It's good product while traveling.Good sound quality, and noise cancellation.The good thing about the device it's goes OFF after certain time if not used and when needed can switch it back ON and gets connected to phone automatically.Good battery back up, approximately 8 hours(continuous-non stop-use) on including calls, videos, music player.But the draw back may be on calls, the person on other end hears the other noises around us than what we speaks.Other than that device is good and perfect."
Boat Rockerz 255 Wireless Bluetooth Headset,4.0,I found the performance of the Boat Rockerz 255 wireless Bluetooth Headset is fairly good. The sound at lower volume is quite good but if the volume is increased there is a slight distortion. The noise cancellation is not very good but it is tolerable. However in this price segment I think the overall performance of the headset is satisfactory. Those who want to go in for a Bluetooth Headset they can try this.
Great wireless earbuds but doesent really do well with sweat and rain or moisture,5.0,"the brand says it is sweat proof ...... i do not feel so i took them for a run for some functional exercise and they give up after a week or so as the sweat seeps in the control pad of the earphones..........that is the only downside to these but they are great sound wise, quality wise really light weigh can go up to for 6 h really great headsets for a price such as that, would really reccomend these if you are not into heavy sweating ....... really great for normal day to day life usage but have to be careful as to not folding the  wires of the earbuds....as the wires withing it gets bound and then the device is disfunctional"
Great value for money,5.0,"These wireless earphones were just amazing. Fits really good and sounds good! Compared to OnePlus bullets bass edition, it has better battery life and bass is little more pronounced. Whereas OnePlus provides magnetic On/off feature and good premium silicon tip instead of plastic, however the wire is  more fragile. At cost difference of Rs. 1200 of boat and Rs. 1600 for OnePlus, boat rockerz 255 pro+ were truly value for money! Just keep in mind that OnePlus has a little better sound latency and hence kinda better for gaming. However I will not recommended any wireless earphones under Rs.2000 which is good for gaming."
Nice earphones with some problems..,3.0,"The headphone is great, but it loses track in between and then behaves wierd.I usually use it to watch movies and sometimes it loses track and the voice breaks. Also delay keeps getting added to the signal. Have to disconnect it form laptop or mobile and then restart the earphone. Upon reconnection after restart it behaves fine for some time, but again the same thing keeps happening.Hope the manufacturer does something for it.It lasts decently long once charged.Sometimes my ears pain after using it for 3-4 hours."
OVERALL its awesome . . . but this BEEP,4.0,the product is all over good in this pricei got it in freedom sale for ‚Çπ999sound quality is awesomebass is also goodno connectivity issuesno discomfort to the earsbattery backup is of 6-7 hourscharging time is 1.5-2 hour for full chargeyou can use them for half hour after 10 minute chargingbut . . . the only thing i hate about these earphones is their BEEP soundevery time i play a video it beeps if i pause the video it beeps and on instagram while scrolling posts if a video comes up it beeps there also and on next video post it beeps again and while scrolling stories on snapchat/insta it beeps there alsoOVERALL its awesome but i hate this BEEP
Not worth...cheap quality,1.0,"The left earpod started giving the crackling noise just after the return period got over... and after that it completely stopped. Not powering on, not charging.. Warranty claim and replacement is not the solution...Product quality needs to be reviewed, recalled, replaced and relaunched with issues fixed... I just wonder how can Boat do such a shoddy job"
Good quality phones at the price,5.0,Got delivery on the same day but it had some issues with charging. Requested for replacement and Amazon was kind enough to replace the item in no time. The quality of reception is good and I can walkover my entire house without much of disruption in the signal quality. The battery life also good. It charges very quickly and lasts for a long time of phone calls/music etc. Overall a good quality of phones at a reasonable price
Bad Quality Plastic,2.0,"The quality of sound though is acceptable the durability of the chipset casing plastic is not very appreciable.The plastic casing housing the Bluetooth and sound control chipset broke /detached in two within one 2 months of using the Charging port alone (Inserting cable.tk port) ,which is necessary to use the earephones.I mean I think it is necessary for the most important component of a Bluetooth earphone to have maximum durability in general but , when it breaks just by inserting the charging cable that's a bummer even against earphones cheaper than this."
Good but needs few attn to details,3.0,"After a month of usage - headphone is good but has few issues like once disconnected, it takes 2 attempts to reconnect. If phone is restarted, pairing has to be done again.Otherwise the product is good with good bass, and ear sound. The voice call is also really good.An adjustable strip would have been good bcos if you fix the earphone in one ear, the other side tends to hang more on other side and have to keep adjusting in between"
"Maybe good enough at Rs. 899, but performance is sub-par",2.0,"I purchased the navy blue edition about a week ago at Rs.1499.The magnets were pretty weak and the sound quality was dismal, especially at higher frequencies. Although the bass is kinda punchy, the audio wasn't smooth. I experienced higher latency on Netflix on my PC, although that wasn't the case on my phone. I returned it as soon as the price dropped to Rs. 899. I ordered the active black this time around, and the same issues persisted but worsened. I got it replaced with the exact same item but to no bliss.I am finally returning this product and going for Rockerzz 330, which is currently available at Rs. 999, and it seems to have bettered the sound quality issue along with a slight improvement in the magnetic field strength of the buds."
Very basic wireless headphones,2.0,"Got these in sale and very disappointed. I had earlier JBL wireless headphones and they were of very good quality then I lost them. Saw ad of these wireless headphones in newspaper and decided to buy as I already use Boat 400 which are awesome but I got disappointed with these, I have to speak very loudly in order for my voice to reach the other party (which looks very weird in public) and I feel that quality is also not upto the mark. Amazon I feel knew about this and thats why these were on sale and non returnable.I am now stuck with them and I DO NOT recommend that you buy these at all.The band got cut on its own where it‚Äôs connected with the small box thingy.Thanks."
Product stopped working within 2 months,1.0,"Bought this for 1000 bucks for my Dad who goes regularly on morning walks. Dad liked it initially but within two months it stopped working as it never switches on. Keep in mind that he would have used it for not more than 10 times.Though it is still under warranty, there is only a single service center in Hyderabad and it is like more than 35 kms away from my place.Glad that I wasted just 1000 bucks coz I have so many other audio systems (home theatre, sound bar) requirement for my new apartment and this experiment means that I will stay away from boAt brand."
Best device,5.0,"Best among the competitors, even better than other bluetooth devises which are double or more in price or so called branded products.Good audio bass, all day batterySays it's splash proof, but I had forgotten it on my garden and it withstand all the rain in night and worked totally perfect after drying üëçüèª"
EXPECTATIONS and RATINGS are MORE THAN its ACTUAL PERFORMANCE,3.0,"##READ IT BEFORE U BUY##SOUND QUALITY not absolutely like HD.. Its Good as compared to others models or companies at the price u get.You need To do a lot of tweaks with eaqualizer in the device.So i didn't like it. TREBLE IS LOW, MIDS ARE BIT GOOD BASS IS SUPERB BUT SUPRESSES ALL OTHER THINGS AND GIVES UNPLEASANT SOUND.NOISE CANCELLATION not as per mentioned on the case. We still hear the things like TV @16VOLUME, HORNS OF BUS, LORRIES AND AUTOS. which actually disturbs ur feel towards music.BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY... Its quite disappointing that even the phone is in my pocket the earphone shows some lag and complete loss of music for few seconds.. It never happened with the other two products i owned. (ALREADY I HAVE BOAT STONE 1000 and ROCKERZ 600 they are awesome in all circumstances at their price).BOAT AUDIO is very good at aggressive pricing and quality but this product disappointed me.****SO I RETURNED BOAT ROCKERZ 255...****"
Boat is not provided genuine product as well as service. Dont buy boat poduct,1.0,product is average just not more and warranty and feedback service of boat is very unfair . I have get defective product like it battery power appear 60% after few minutes it show low batter as 20%  so that try to contact boat service care where she replied like you have send this product to our only service center located in ahmedabad only on center in Gujarat as well as same in other state also and both sending and returning courier charges paid by me sich terms and I have get this product after 10 to 20 days back after repair or replaced . so that i contacted boat's official E-mail but not got any feedback. so that I suggested don't buy this Boat product becoz they not provided genuine product as well as customer oriented service also . wasting your money .
The most irritating messages played by bluetooth device,1.0,"""You are now connected to rockerz 255 pro"" - the device keeps playing this message every min during the call. Even when I answer the call, instead of connecting the audio of the call immediately, it plays this message and then connects the audio. In those 3-4 seconds, we can't hear the other person. Another irritating message that is continuously played is ""Maximum Volume"". It keeps playing this message every 30 seconds during the call until I reduce the volume. In short, if you are looking for a hands free for the calls, don't go for this at all. You will hear rockerz ads more than the other person."
Good product!Go for it.,5.0,"2 days review: Upto now its awesome. Bass is too good.(But if you are melody song lover then MAY BE you won‚Äôt like this product). For loud and bass loving person its the best.Sound quality is 90/100Bass is 95/100Comfort 99/100Noise cancellation 95/100Bluetooth connectivity 100/100Mic quality 99/100 ( At the time of buying I was worried about mic quality as many people said its not good but its good no-one complaint about my voice while talking on phone).When more than 1 lakh review gives a product 4 stars than it will be most likely a decent product.At this price range it deserves 5 stars for bass , connectivity , comfort , noise cancellation and sound quality respectively.I have used many headphones but at this price range its the best.Go for it."
Amazing Product !!!,5.0,"Finding a bluetooth wireless earphones is always difficult when you have so much options available.I have gone through every single video for almost all of the wireless bluetooth earphones under Rs1500 and came to the decision of buying this product.So, the product is almost perfect in every term.Design & Build Quality : 10/10...SuperbFitting : 9/10Audio : 9/10...The bass is very good with highs and lows are also very good. Felt bass is kind of on the higher side but sound is a bit on the deeper side in my opinion.Loud: 10/10Battery : 10/10...Used almost for 3 days without charging for normal 2-2.5hr usageEven bought Infinity(JBL) Glide 120 earphones for comparison but this boat one is more clear in almost every aspect.Genuine Music Lover so consider if these reviews are of help."
NA,4.0,"This is after a month of regular usage at gym.  Sound clarity is good. Bass is good. Battery backup is nice. Noise cancellation is also good. The only issue with this is the range. Too short. Even if there is some pillar in between, the sounds breaks. Except that everything else is fine. As long as the phone is very close by, this works good."
Awesome Sounds Quality,5.0,"Sound Quality is Amazing. We can hear and separate each and every music instrument.We can hear the even very low bits of every instrument separately.Bass quality is awesome.Bass and Treble Balance is perfect. The Ear cannot ache after long time use.Mic is very sensitive. Even on High way with full of wind and even we wear helmet, the crystal clear voice can be listen on ther side.No noise issue.I recommend to buy 1000 times.."
"Well, A product that value for your money...",5.0,"This earphone is a good product in this price range and it's running good. Although some minor issues I have felt in this product and one of them is convenience. There is a knotch above the earbud which is helpful to fit the earplug in the ear, but some people may have different structure of ear and for them it will not for well eg. one of my friend.Another issue was there; just after reaching the battery level to 20% it starts disturbing telling low battery, and within a few minutes it turned off, I think boat should think about this.Otherwise I'm using this product for couple of months, till now its running well and the sound quality is also good."
Pretty Good!,4.0,"I have the wireless on the ear headphones from BOAT (400 I guess...can't remember the model details) for about 2 years and still works well. I am an occasional user of that.But I wanted something for my commute and I was looking for something wireless and with in ear buds to go with my 1+6T. I found these for 1k during the recent sale. Here are my initial impressions1. The sound signature is very very bassy. You need to use an EQ to bring it to your liking. Try listening to a song that has a heavy beat or bass played high to experience your tolerance levels.2. If you use a One Plus 6 or newer phone, go into the audio tuner option in settings and set the 'Sound Enhancement' option to 'One Plus Bullets Wireless's and the EQ preset to 'Pop'. This should balance out the bass and it surprisingly alleviated the mid tones.3. Pairing was east. Long press the middle button and put your phone on blue tooth discovery mode.5. Sweat resistance and durability is something I have to wait and watch as this is just initial days. But looking at the construction quality, I think it should be ok.6. Call Quality - not checked. But I don't intend to use it to take too many calls anyway.Verdict: Good for 1k but not worth more. in fact paying more than 1k and buying something for listening music falls into the audiophile category. For that, you should really invest in an established brand like Bose or Sennheiser."
So Claverley designed . The idea of inline mouthpiece is so useful,4.0,So Claverley designed . The idea of inline mouthpiece is so useful. battery back up is like huge. Overall best buy. I had brought at 1400/- now it became 1300/-. In HDFC credit card it became 1190/-. I don't know why they don't give offer for other credit cards.
Best bass earphones at this price,5.0,So here is my review after 1 month of use1. bass is good and boosted2. sound quality is also nice3. i got these earphones with 100% charging.the conclusion is that i loved it....i found it better than what i was expecting.The built quality is high....in short its awesome bluetooth earphones in this price.i got it at just 950rs on amazon festival sale.So go ahead and buy itü§ó‚ù§‚ù§
Comfortable and best in this price range,4.0,"Can't compare with sony or any other branded ones. But in this price it's good. Silicon material good to wear no feeling of like we are carrying it on our neck . Its comfortable having it around the neck due to good silicon material.  As this is in ear canal type speakers we. Eed to really push it inside the canal 1st 1/3.then only we can enjoy real beats and bass. If you wear it superficially sound won't look great. So far battery , durability,sound ,price this is best one."
"Enjoyed purchasing in 2019, regret purchasing it again in 2020",3.0,"This was a great buy when I purchased it in 2019, since then the price got cut considerably coz of competition, and so did the quality. They've spent more money on hiring celebs, than on product quality.I was so happy with the 2019 purchase that I got it again in Nov of 2020, but this time it did not last even a year, there's no external damage, but the headset started off with regular disconnections without any reason, and now it will only work if I keep holding the power button, like what?I have bought another, but if it has similar issues, it will be my last but from boat. üëçüèª"
Poor Bass,1.0,Looks like I got a fake product. Less sound more noise and no bass. Typically not a boat material. May be I got duplicate. I want to return this but due to some emergency I was unable to do so. I lost interest in buying headphones and mobile's from Amazon. Better to give 500 more to shop and purchase a product after carefull observation
Two time power-failure and replacement.,1.0,"This is a horrible product. The boat's site says IPx7 water resistance. I bought the product on 13th Aug 2021, took it for a road run, and on 15th Aug, it died. Wonder if my sweat makes more pressure than IPx7. Got it replaced in September and it died again after 15 days during a run.  In past, I bought a cheap Anker headphone that went for 2yrs. But this product is just horrible. Can't replace the product so many times. Probably last time I bought from the boat brand. My infinity headphone is doing great, should have stick to that."
Great Product with average battery,4.0,I have been using this Boat rockerz 255 pro for more than 20 days. Sound quality is awesome. Bass is extremely good and the call quality is awesome. None of the person at the other end complained regarding the voice quality. Everything is perfect except the battery. I usallly used to charge once in a day and it comes for a full day. It comes for more than 5 hours on my usage. One important thing is it charges quick . Within 1 hr it charges full. There are 3 buttons in it. Center button is for On/ off / pause/ google assistant and Volume up button is used for volume increase and playing next song and Volume down for volume down and previous song. Whenever you power on and off it will comes up with a voice command. Often the sound breaks for 0.003 seconds and connects backs automatically.  It's not a cons. I'll hereby provide the Pros and consPros:1. Excellent Sound Quality2. Bass is awesome3. Call quality is good4. Connnects two devices simultaneously5.Build quality is awesomeCons:1.Battery is average2.No auto pause feature when the earbuds are joined like there is realme buds and oneplus
"Wonderful product, great sound quality and the best battery backup time.",5.0,"Noise cancellation is wonderful during conversation, Microphone is wonderful, even in a noisy background it delivers great sound. and the biggest highlight is the battery, charges fast and standby is over 10 days with 2 hours of talk time each day, and a couple of hours of music / podcast listening.overall a great product and the best value for money."
The pros outweigh the cons,5.0,"I am using the Rockerz 255 pro earphone for over 2 months now.After receiving the product, when I first tried pairing it, I was unable to do so as my phone or my laptop was not able to connect to it. I had to manually reset the device (it's simple, look it up online), I was finally able to pair it with both my laptop and my phone.I have used it to attend numerous meetings and interviews, and never had any problems with it. It has decent noise cancellation.While it is true that it can connect to both laptop and a smartphone simultaneously, I personally experienced some audio interruptions while listening to music from my laptop, while also being connected to a smartphone. I never have any such problems while being connected to any one device at a time.I only have to charge it once a day, for only about 30 mins. It's usually connected to my phone for about 12 hours a day, out of which I actively use it for about 8 hours. I have very recently observed a minor bulge on the left box (the part where the left earpiece is connected to the rest of the neckband), so I think the battery is puffing up a bit (I am not sure about this). The performance has not been affected because of this issue, and only time will tell if this will ever cause any problems.Initially, I did not like the audio quality of this device. I do not prefer music with a lot of bass, and it feels like this earphone is specifically designed to just amplify bass in any music that is being played. I tried attenuating the bass using the equaliser in my phone, but that worked only to an extent, so I had to download an equaliser app from the playstore to completely attenuate any bass from the music. Doing that, I surprisingly found that the earphone is very much capable of delivering crystal clear audio. As I am not a big fan of bass, I cannot comment on the bass quality of the product.[Edit after 6 months of use: The battery did end up puffing more over time, and the battery life was affected (as I predicted while writing the first review). Thankfully though, as it was covered under warranty, Boat arranged for a doorstep pickup, took a look at it, and sent me a brand new replacement in just 6 days]"
Horrible customer service,1.0,"Never buy the boat product, there customer service is pathetic and so is the product. Within 15 days it stopped working and it's been more than another 15 days that am struggling for the replacement. Boat's authorised service center people are rude and there customer service and service center people are not on the same page.As per customer service the replacement is to be done immediately but the service center people ask you to wait for another 15 to 20 days on top they don't give any acknowledgement post taking the possession of the faulty earphone. I have sti ll not received the replacement.NEVER BUY BOAT'S PRODUCT, NOT RELIABLE AT ALL."
Good Product for normal use nothing fancy except battery life,4.0,"# Best battery backup# Sound Quality is good# Noise cancellation is normal# Bass quality better, but some times feel unwanted# Plus minus button arrangement is different# Play next song by pressing volume up working# Play previous song by pressing volume down working# Double click dial previous call in call list and pressing 3 second open Google assistant# Song play and pause has little delayed compared to other brands# Not feeling heavy  because of that extra control Mount# Indication light is bright but it divert attention in night time, driving become more irritative# Hiss noise is not coming in my purchase veriant (nevy blue)# Battery life is good# They have accepted that this product doesn't come with aptx encoding (added sticker on box in place of that old aptx logo)# Some time sbc feels better some time aac depending upon song quality# Magnatic joins are good enough to hold in one place# Look and feel is average# R L ear piece indication not given in erophones (given on in ear rubber holder )"

not awesome,4.0,after 3 days of use I am writing this review.. I have got it at Rs. 999.001) battery life almost 5 hours of music.  not a problem for me.2) built up quality good.3) most importantly sound quality not awesome. may be good. if u like bass a great then good choice but vocal sound is seemed lower and sometimes not crystal clear. I have senheiser cx180 which costs rs.750. produces much crisp sound and bass.but overall at rs. 999 it is a good deal.

Beware - company is making fraud claims on Aptx support. No option to return!,1.0,"Beware everyone - company is making fraudalent claims regarding Aptx support. This is the only reason I bought this as I know it helps improve sound quality. I have already tried it in 2 different phones - as HD codec, only AAC is listed. No option for Aptx - other Aptx headphones work fine on the same.Build quality is quite cheap and sound is just okay. If I knew it did not actually support Aptx , I would have definately looked at other options.Also, Amazon does not allow to return it (what is effectiey being sold in fraudalent marketing) which also is not a good experience and just breaks the trust we have had when buying things on Amazon."
Duplicate product. Lowest quality. Cannot even match Chinese product.,1.0,Just go t to know that the product provided is not original bit a duplicate on. Lowest quality. Cannot even match Chinese product. One side stopped in a month and other side which gives sound is not fittinnin the ear due to faulty or low quality ear bud (pic attached where placed but the ear phones together so that u see the difference). Had tough time with the customer service which states 1 year warranty but now covid situation has made passed 1 year and customer care isn't responding. So finally gave up. Hope I would have given the money to some poor person....at least some blessings I would have got...please look for some other option but don't even think of this
Defective Product from Boat through Amazon,1.0,"I have ordered many products from AMAZON  but this  time a wrong selection for a Product  from BOATi mean to say about  Boat Rockers 255 sports edition .Got the product today by 1 pm (11Nov)  tried for switching on ,but its not powering on, thought battery low for new product ,so kept for charging  for 1.5 hrs  tried to switch on again  its not powering on..while connecting to charger its showing  bluelight (its means its fully charged), but while removing charger its not powering on.So its clear fact its a defective product. returned the product on the spot to Amazon .Very bad product , i was going through reviews found many of them has faced issue with this producti don't why this kind of product amazon has kept as best seller  and Amazon choice product.Kindly remove this product from Amazon choice their are other best products  than Boat.Thanks"
Review time..!!,3.0,"I bought this boAt rockerz 255 on my friends suggestion, hez using these for a quit while now say months... Whn i ordered i got a defective one...mic issue...crackling sound, buzzing noise.., So replaced it. Now coming to the review, the sound is OK OK at this price range, battery works fine but the more u use u know the electronic products the work time reduces.. they mentioned 6hrs but for me..5hrs max. Again it depends u see. Easy to use.. some devices tale time to settle as i said my 1st  defective product , ot took min to settle down n give a good sound.. untill thn u hv to bear with crackling sounds buzzing noise..(i said with some devices not all, u shld b lucky to gt a gud product at 1st time or else replace/return). Wire is a bit lengthy though if u dn hv a problm with tht, then its fine. Buttons are on right side so difficult to operate while riding bike as we hv accelerator on right side. Overall OK product at this price... Atleast its better than boult curve band/ boult probass space. And now my friend got an issue with his boAts mic...

Only basss it have. My old sony head phone is much better than this..,3.0,I am using this boat ‚õµ F255pro. After 2 month use i feel that it fitting in ear is not so good. You can not plugin to eat for long time. Shape of ear loop is also not good. Sound quality is ok Bass is High but the actul sound quality of every beat is missing. Only bass bass bass.... My previous sony ear phone was much better than this....
Good looks n built but Average Sound,4.0,This earphone looks really good. But sound quality is just average. Bass is heavy but sound is not punchy n crispy. If sound quality is your priority and you have experienced some good quality earphones then you will feel that something is missing in it.In this case don't go for it.If you are an average user who wants a decent sound and a good looking bluetoth earphone then go for it. Buit quality also seems nice.Noise cancellation and ear grip has no issues at all. Average battery back up. But it charges quickly. Bluetooth range is also decent.Overall a decent product in it's price segment.
Average Wireless Headset,3.0,"After using 1 month writing this review.... bit disappointment.. am using this on daily basis when u used it continuously then ears getting pain.. I would say rs 999 wireless headset its average....PROSGood battery life.Fully water-resistant.Decent sound quality.Comfortable, well-fitting.CONSBass and low tones could be better.Utilizes old Bluetooth version 4.1.No storage case included."
It gives what it claims!,4.0,"It is a nice product. I use mainly for calls and watching videos. My friends told me the call clarity is better than One plus bullets. Pairing is easy.I think an average person uses his phone for 6 hours only per day, so just have to charge it everyday like we charge our mobiles. It gives proper 6 hours play back, range is as listed. Inconvenience is only that the magnetic function on the earbuds doesn't switch off and on the device as in oneplus. But if you wanna go for earphone under a budget price, I really recommend this. Tip: buy while the product is on discount, we got it for Rs.899."
Original products have or Not,1.0,"I have found a duplicate product by the name of this original product. So if you are shopping, please check the product when you purchase it... The logo is displayed on all three sides of the original product, I did not find anything like that on it, it has a barcode sticker but there is an exception."
Deserves 5 star but there's an issue with Bluetooth connectivity {Connect & discussed},2.0,If you're looking for a massive better backup go for it what is show's it had proven themSound good.There's an minior issue with microphone.If we talk about it's cons then there's something which I've been facing for long time with all my bluetooth devices like One+ Billets ZMi super bass headphoneMi neckbandMi compact speakerAnd now with this Boat rockerz 255 pro+Even I've tried all these in different Mobile devices but all I got is disappointmentEven I've tried all possible factors to resolve the issue like resting bluetooth settings put it to the Bluetooth pairing whatever...#Keep this in mind while you decide to go for Rockerz 255 pro+Still except that frequently disconnect and connect issue even I have purchased 3 of them for friends...#
Nice One. But not 100%,4.0,"I have been using Boat headset of same range for the past 2-3 years which was wired. I feel this is not the same as the wired one. The quality of sound was still clearer/bass wise/ shrillness wise in the wired one. Still does its job. Able to take calls during my jog with its mic,able to change songs with the buttons on the sides, everything works great.  good one."
I can confidently say go for it.üëç,5.0,"See I'm writing this review after rigorously using it for 1 month. So it's my honest opinion on it. No BS.1) Sound Quality is really very good. I personally like it. Now I don't know of others taste. While listening music it feels good as it gives balanced output.2) Among all I'm quite impressed by it's battery life. It really goes on long after continues use I've noticed it & even quickly get charged also once put on charging mode toh anyways battery ka toh muje nhi lagta problem jaldi aane wala h.3) I've handles it in various ways and also put  it in various ways in bags sometimes thrown here and there and main thing I've use it in rain recently for really long time I was riding and suddenly rain came so at that time came to know the quality of it. It's really nice. I've used it in rain for almost 4-5 times in heavy rain although that's different thing that I later on after 10 min covered it because intentionally I don't wanted to damage it.4) When you are riding a bike and if unfortunately you put earphones in ear which you shouldn't do it but if someone does also then the problem is that by air flow the üëÇ earphones get moved away because of air from our body which sometimes make us uncomfortable while riding. So for that you need to tuck earphone's inside your tee or shirt or beneath your collar of shirt to get hold on.5) It's a very light weight earphones don't go on my words you will feel when you take it in your hands.The only thing they should have provided is more earphone buds of various size they didn't gave anything with box.Overall till now I don't have any hard feelings or negative feelings toward it might be because I haven't I think experienced, that's why. Good to go with this product. üëç"
Too many issues. Not worth the price.,3.0,"This product is good, but not worth the price. I found three issues:-1- bass quality is poor (poor than the boat 225 I used, and regardless of its description saying ""extra bass""2- hissing sound on connecting.3- no proper volume boundaries. When it is on vol. 1,2,3, the sound is very low, and increases suddenly when taken to vol 4. On achieving minimum volume, the earphones tell ""minimum volume"" with a volume which is full I guess. Lol.Overall, I hated this product, and have issued it for return."
Best in class but battery backup is low,4.0,I already had boat rockerz 400 which has good battery backup upto 9 to 10 hours so i brought this for 1299 in an offer.Talking about pros1. It has great design with metal body feels premium.2. If you listen music equalizer than believe me it has some really good bass.3. It has a great connection with i think above 10m which is again great.4. Battery charging is really fast i mean this charges the earphone from 0 to 100 in just 45 mins.5. Sound quality is good i can hear all the instrumental sound clearly.Cons.1. Battery backup is very low at 70% volume it will run for only 5 to 6 hours so to get more battery you need to lower the volume which is not good.2. Without equalizer the vocals and mids are good but bass is very low.The only reason i am returning it is battery backup otherwise this may be the best wireless neckband under 1500.If battery backup ia not an issue for you then you should definitely buy it this is best.It only lost my 1 star bcuz of battery otherwise it deserves 5 star.
Product is goot but doesn't last long and no customer support for the product,1.0,"I was quite satisfied with the product till the time there was no fault in it, once the fault occurred in left earpiece within 6 months (Still in warranty period) then it's almost impossible to use the warranty as you will never be able to connect to boAt customer service, If you call their customer service they keep you waiting forever, the email id provided is invalid and their customer support is only available between 12pm-6pm and so far Amazon customer care has also not been able to resolve this.Even if the product is good but now i regret purchasing such product whose service centers are very limited, which makes them reachable through phone or email only which they never attend or they provide invalid email id."
Very useful and good sound quality,5.0,"The working range of the wireless was far better than I had expected! Attaching two devices at the same time, many times resulted in 1sec sound drops periodically which was a bit annoying, but then it's a feature I don't think I would really want to use - one device at a time it's good enough for me and no such issues thereüòÄ Overall, a very satisfying productüëç"
I am not buying this brand ever again,1.0,"Sound quality was good while it lastedProduct didn't last for more than 30 days. It just refuses to come on. Tried calling the service agency, but no response. Wrote an email to the company, no response from them.I have edited my entire earlier write up. Typical Made in China product. Talk claims on quality, but fails miserably to keep up to its word.Please do not buy this product. Total waste of money."
LOOPHOLE IN WARRANTY (No Warranty.),2.0,"BE CAREFULL!!!!! Bought this product 8-9 months ago.1) Now It has started to automatically disconnect and the left one isn't working.2) First of all Amazon doesn't take care of the warranty.3) You have to directly contact boat support.4) I contacted their customer care they didn't pick up.5) they messaged me an address of their service center near me. I went their and they refused the warranty.6) this bluetooth earphone has a charging port which has a rubber lid which is about 2-3mm it is connected to the earphone through a very delicate rubber piece. It is so delicate that  it doesn't matter how much you take care of it, it will eventually tear off and get lost. Now that 2-3 mm price of rubber has no technical purpose not one. But it has sabotaged my warranty.7) I cannot claim my warranty because of that 1mm piece of rubber8) This is a LOOPHOLE delebrately made by BIAT so that customers cannot claim the WARRANTY.9) I bought this for 1499/- and cannot claim the warranty because of their clever loophole."
Everything is Good ONLY until 1 year,2.0,"Bought this headset about an year ago. Now it stops working on right side and works only on left side.Most of the bluetooth or wired headset, i have purchased having same issues. Either one side stops working after a year or so. Is it how these headphones are designed so that customer should buy a new one?Better to go for a cheaper one and replace it with new one after one year!!!."
Feeling good as I got it free with huawei Y9 phone,4.0,"Dear All,Let me write the genuine review of this product.The product was delivered on time,Guys, I am using this product since 2 last month and I have discovered an excellent product.The product is much better as compare to other costly international brands.Likes :* Excellent bass* Noise cancellation support* Value for moneyDislikes:* I expect more form the local brand in terms of quality of material used e.g. plastic quality and packaging box.Overall suggestion you buy with this price..!"
It is good you can go for it!,4.0,"Pros:1) Product design is compatible and flexible2) Comfortable during work eg., gym, walking, or travelling3) Quality of sound is near 4/5 which is good if you compare it with othersCons:1) Battery backup is less2) I don't recommend if you want it for gaming or movies at home,(cz you don't need wireless when you are at home)Overall product is nice 1000 rupees it is good deal. 1st understand your need then go for wireless headphones unnecessarily don't go for it! I do running and gym so it was necessary but for gaming I don't use it! Take decision wisely cz wired one gives better quality always in same budget!"
Sound & Battery is super,5.0,"I am writing after 4 days to delivery,  Sound is ossam & working from home so use for office meeting calls & it‚Äôs great!Yes  little havy in look wise but in performance it‚Äôs amazing and i love it.I use 4 t0 5 hours daily and 30% battery reduced in 4 days.If you are really looking amazing product then go for it.Thanks"
Great headset and sturdy build,5.0,"Great headset for music lovers. Solid bass, loud volumes and volume control separate for the headset in addition to mobile volume control which is a huge plus. Good sound quality on audio calls. Did not try while jogging, so unabl to review the moisture wicking properties much. Good length to the earphone cable and good battery life. I purchased it for 949 INR and h nice good VFM. Overall I would buy again.Design wise, I like the Boult wireless better than this as the wire tends to hang long down your neck when you are not using the earphones  Otherwise a great product to buy!"
I personally don't like it much,2.0,Writting this review after using it for 1 year and a month.Sound quality is good with good battery back up but bass overpowers everything which i think most indian customers like but not me.Also my mic stopped working partially after 3-4 months and completely after 8 months didn't go for replacement that was my fault but it's mic is not good trust me.Plus two days back suddenly they are not charging they were okay a night before idk what happened to its life for me is little more than a year.It's upto you to buy it or not.
wrost return policy.,1.0,i order this today and after using for 4 hr continuously i find these earphones a little irritable  to my ears. so i apply for return request but later i got to know that this product is not eligible for return. it was mention no where that i could not return it. how do we end user got to know about it ? atleast highlight it somewhere so we customer can know this before buying it. Please be genuine so customer can trust u. although i dont trust you anumore.and your customer support also worst.  they behave like pre program system that speak only certain things. if something is not in their scope they become helpless instead of helping us.
Great battery backup,5.0,I'm writing this for pro+ model which supports 40hours battery backup though there may be some terms and conditions to get that much backup. I loved it. I'm using this for official purposes. I'm a guy who will be on call for 3-4 hours a day and loved to listen music continuously. With this usage I'm getting a battery backup for 4-5 days. So I need to charge once in a week approx. Coming to noise cancellation it is not up to mark. Sound is good.
Boat,3.0,"It‚Äôs just okay.. because it is not meet my expectations, dual connectivity is not stay able and when one phone connection is working (like call ongoing) another connection is disturbing ( disconnect/connected) with connection voice notifications. It is very irritating. Boat needs to solve the problem. Rest is ok like, volume/Bass/battery/noise cancellation etc.If anyone buy for calling purpose,try One plus z neckband. It is amazing dual connectivity, and battery backup is awesome."
No Brainer - Go for it,5.0,"I am not an audio expert and don‚Äôt know much about bass /treble etc. The earphones sound fine and last a good couple of years. This is my second purchase exactly 2 years after I bought the first one. At Rs.999 - it‚Äôs the best value for money earphone out there. No brainer- go for it. The ordering experience at Amazon was also great. They initially shipped me an empty box with nothing inside. When I escalated the matter to customer service, a perfectly good replacement was sent the very next day. Truly world class Customer service."
Not working,1.0,"It is not working now,  though within warranty period. Purchased on 2nd July 2020. Need to be replaced as per warranty policy. Kindly arrange for replacement.Very bad experience. Product Stopped working now. It should be replaced as it is well within warranty period.Neither Amazon is owning up nor customer care of company is responding.POOR"
"Excellent for rough use, average sound quality",5.0,"Satisfactory for battery life and the day long use.Sound quality is average. Bass is good.You will not feel very good on music. So if you are music lover don't go for it.Attending lecturers, simple songs, online classes run good on it. It is best for online classes and attending lecturers but not for music üé∂ lover.Battery life is awesome, 37hr. Charging is superfast. Don't test in water üí¶. Light weight.It is not for music üéµ, but for only hearing sounds like attending lectures.Microphone is not so good, but average. But, it doesn't make much difference.Value for money only for rough use purpose.For Better sound quality which is for the music lovers  - house of marley smile > Sennheiser > sony > jbl > boat ‚õµ."
OK type product,3.0,"I bought this product after checking out so many rating and reviews. i bought it around three month ago and with passage of time, it's sound quality, working hours and connectivity is degrading.I don't know how does it happen, in my office there is a disturbing noise during connection and it connects perfectly as soon as I move out of that place, funny it is. Anyway, if you are looking for really good product, i must say you need to increase your budget. i can't blame brand as i have wired earphones of same brand and those are perfectly working, but i am disappointed with this model."
6 months of frustration for 899/-,1.0,"The worest Bluetooth earphones...if you put mobile in front pants pocket it will not properly connect...if you put in back pocket it will not connect at all...it will only connect if you hold mobile in your hands...what a damm worest product...If you want to buy frustration and anger for 899/- then go for this... probably the worest product from boAt..Appreciate then in decreasing the happyness index in India with the help of  Amazon...Only buy this is you want frustration, anger and irritation for next 6 months...but show that on boAt earphones not on your mobile..."
"Good for normal usage, mediocre sound quality.",4.0,"Rockerz 255 pro+ : Using this product since 15 days and the performance is pretty good. The sound quality is a bit low, but again the biggest usp is its battery backup. It goes for about 5-7 days without charging upon regular usage. The range of the bluetooth is also very good and connectivity is maintained within a normal household. The bass is okay, wouldn't say it's great, because the sound clarity goes down on high bass setting. Many times sharper beats are skipped while playing the songs. The only thing which is bothersome is the those pionty silicone attached in the bud, which I removed within two three days because they made buds heavy and were not helpful in any way.Pros: battery, noise cancelling, range, economic price, type c charging, bass, fast chargingCons: sound clarity, ergonomics.Overall worth a buy, if you do not care too much about the sound quality and need good battery backup."
Gone in a Month.. Beware,3.0,"Boat started showing its business. Got earphones with brand image. Everything went well upto a month , then one side got off.Yes there is option for warranty. But it doesn't mean that product gets out of order in a month.Bass is not up to mark, as other boat earphones I have.Hope company starts providing complete products,without compromise."
A very good product,5.0,"after a month of using it, here is my review.The battery last for about 5hrs of continuous usage. The connectivity over a long distance is better than most earpods. calling connectivity is smooth as any other earphone. And lastly, the sound is soft and easy to listen to, it felt clear and doesn't hurt my ear."
Poor sound quality and harmful for ears,1.0,"1. The sound is too blurry and it's very irritating. It's like you are listening on some loud speaker.2. If you keep the buds in ear and not listening to anything, you start feeling ear pain and headache.3. Not able to use it continuously for more than 20 mins. Everytime I had to remove it, rest and then use.4. The magnet on the bud is useless and its has very less attraction and buds gets detached very frequently. Also the magnet neither stops the song nor it disconnects the earphones. Thus battery is not preserved.5. Build quality is also very poor. The one is received looks like reused.6. Total waste of money."
Worst is less for this disgusting product,1.0,"This may be the worst product ever deliver by amazon. Packing ?? What should I say ....it worst, the packet torned already. About the headphone this is worst too, it has some kind annoying countineous sound, while listening, don't buy it ...just don't it is the worst. It cost 1499 and it utter waste of money. It does not even deserve a zero rating but unfortunately 0 is not available, so I have to give 1. It is worst product , worst worst disgusting."
Mic is a disaster!,3.0,"Everything about this product is good except for the mic. It captures everything that is happening around me but not my voice lol. It's kinda funny as well as annoying because during calls you have to either choose a quiet place or simply talk the old school way i.e. directly holding the phone. It seems like these earphones will be great for spies like Mr. bond where he can just stay mum and let his comrades know his location from his surrounding sounds lmao. I am telling you, this product can save people who are in trouble and can't speak while hiding from danger, they just need to call the police and wait for them to deduce where that person is by hearing the noise coming from all around him/her.3/5 for the sorry excuse of a mic.4/5 for comfort and battery.5/5 for music clarity and bass.Overall I'd suggest some other BT product over these for overall better performance."
"Good, but not the best.",4.0,"Pros:1.lowest price.2.Best in class battery backup.3. HD audio support by Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor.Cons:1.low density plastic, which can reduce durability.2. Cable remembers every fold mark due to its low Quality.Still keeping the price range and battery backup, one can consider buying."
Very very third class company n service of boat...please don't buy any product of boat,1.0,Very very third class service of boat company... I purchased products 2 July 2019...it is including  1 year warranty... One side ear bird not working after 6 months I filled complaint on may 2020...they did not give me service for repair n replace...

Very third class company
Lovely product,5.0,I love this product basically I order this product for personal useI buy this in just 999 rupees and I love this to be very Frank if you are getting this in 1000 or 1100 rupees it is value for money and basically those who are playing games and need headphones with the surround sound this is basically for you guys only because I used to many products and which generally legging the sound or you can say the sound delay I am using airpods as well. To be very Frank it make sound delays and that was around 10 times more expensive from this. And the conclusion is this is the best product you can buy in 1100 buks
Use for 11 months and one replacement in warranty,4.0,Using for 11 months now. Use it for music and office calls. Reasonable sound and ok mic. I am satisfied. The range is around 6-8 ft (ca. 244 cm) but in open space it is more than 12 ft (3.66 m). The charge is for 3-4 hrs of continuous running else with my calls it is good for 8 hrs+/ . In last 10 day the right side speaker stopped working. I raised warranty (11 month/12 month) and got a new replacement from service station - while I had to wait for about a week for the service station to get replacement.
Very nice buy @ 1000 bucks,5.0,"I am using this for last 2 weeks now. Using mainly for online corporate meetings. I got it in a deal @ INR 999Pros:- Very nice built quality & ergonomic design- Well fitted in ears & also has option for 3 sizes of ear buds- May range upto 5 to 6 metres in absence of any obstacles (Haven't tasted beyond that yet)- Clear & excellent sound quality for songs & videos (For meetings, it depends on your network. But still found it very neat)Cons:- Bluetooth connection & switching devices takes little more time than expected- Battery life is very short than expected But charging is quickOverall:Worth & must buy at INR 1000. It's actual price is INR 1500 now. So you might think longer before booking this & might want to compare above features with other products at this range."
"Overall Best one. Less noise generation. Battery is 11/10 Yes, beyond the expectations.",5.0,"40 hour battery backup is mentioned is description but in my case, it lasts 6 to 7 days( on lite use i.e. 5 to 6 hours per day media playback and connected for 10 to 12 hours per day). All products of boat have a common issues , when the wire is rubbing with your clothes or with neck, an unbearable noise is generated. All other features are beyond the expectations but noise generation can be improved by boat. Other neckbands with silicon type smooth material may be the good choice if you hate the rubbish noice. Charging time is also very less. I got it in 999/- after 100 rs cashback (if you pay using Amazon pay then hopefully you can get 10% cashback upto rs 100).Some audio legging is there in these earphones, it can be upto 0.5 seconds. You can notice is easily when watching any video. A bit heavier than the wired boat earphones. Looks are exactly same as shown on Amazon."
Genuine Review,4.0,The boat wired earphones (225) which come at the price of 500 is quite affordable and value for money if u r comfortable with the wires.I found a bit more bass in this product.. . .Bt 1000rs just for bluetooth and a litte bit of bass is not something which I would go for.Rest is all ok...And.. The delivery boy worst ever handling of the product.Kamina mu thhoda aur ladata to pit jata. Jaahil kahi ka. Utterly idiotic behaviour.
What else do you want!!ü•∞ü§©ü§©,5.0,The battery life is so good i purchased and got on 14th august and today is 23rd August and i didn't charge it and till now its 40% and also the sound quality is very good and once you wear both the earphones then you will not be able to hear anyone except from what you are listening and also the bluetooth is very good you just have to connect once and then just turn on the earphone and you are automatically connected....one of the best bluetooth earphones i got till now!!üòÑüòÑ
worst customer support. I suggest never to buy it,1.0,"worst warranty experience .I registered a warranty complaint in March .still in November their is no exchange done by boat and it is also a tough task to contact boat customer support every time I tried to contact the waiting time is too lengthy I get bored and myself cut the call and never had a talk with them even after too much waiting. two times they said we are shipping your product. now on nov 19 they suddenly said your warranty expires  we can not do anything buy a new product ,even i had claimed in early march"
"Not worth to buy, look for other options if you looking something pro",1.0,"- Replacement product covers with full of sand and dirt around it, i think it directly shipped from sahara or cairoüòÅ- Not feel special about this product as audio quality is normal, battery even discharge in 4-5 hrs of continuos usuage with normal sound, I'm really very upset with this purchase.- Voice is not audiuble clearly to other, many times while on call due this alrady replaced it twice but still not satisfied with that.- Below Average product if you looking something good try other product.- Other great products are available with same price or little higher with better features and quality. - After six months of use, it's stop working. Charging for hours and this thing us not getting on, what a waste of money üò°."
Good bass and good battery backup. Mids and highs are not upto the expectation level.,5.0,Not for music lovers. The bass is good but I found Mi dual driver wired earphone has better sound quality when it comes to playing songs. I use it for office works like attending Google meets and calls and switching to youtube video in lap to avoid frequent plugging in and out from mobile and lap. Battery backup is very good.
All rounder product,4.0,"This is a nice product by BOATEverything is good (music,call quality,bass,treble,instrumental sound,vocals)Only thing it misses is that these earphones misses the comfort in ear üëÇThese are designed for people with kinda big ears but if you will use it frequently you will get used to itOtherwise these are very niceBut not recommended for heavy gaming"
Good one..,4.0,"I have researched the available wireless earphones in the market and chose this one based on the reviews and YouTube videos. I am using it for my Cell and while watching movies/programs on my Smart TV. I was unable to connect to my laptop due to Bluetooth issues on my laptop. I may have to use dangle on my laptop.Likes -1. Its easy to pair your devices with this earphone.2. Sound quality is good.3. Noise cancellation is good.4. Light weight and stylish to use anywhere.5. It is water resistant (Not water proof, remember). One time, I have used it in the moderate rain as well.6. Easy to carry and not bulky. Provided magnet keeps both earbuds at one place, so it won't be a discomfort when you are walking/running/in Gym and not using the earphones.7. Decent battery backup. I use 2 hours at a time mostly. In a day, I use it for like 3 to 4 hours and I only charge once in 2 days based on my usage. If you use more than that, then you may have to charge it everyday.Dislikes -1. As they advertised, I am unable to pair two devices simultaneously.2. Its an irritation to charge as the battery pin will not fit with adapter at one go. You have to carefully insert it.3. Unable to answer the call via ear phones. You have to answer it on the cell phone and talk via earphones. Same goes for cutting the call.4. Initially, there was discomfort to keep the earphone in the ear for an hour itself (while walking). After that, Its ok.My conclusion - Good one to buy."
SAVE YOUR MONEY.,2.0,"After 3 months of usage1. Company claims for an 8 hour battery backup : It‚Äôs not the case, nowhere near. I got these solely for my gym sessions lasting 2 hours every morning. Despite leaving it overnight on charge and the indicator does show fully charged with a blue light, these earphones have deceived me on multiple occasions and the battery didn‚Äôt  even last 2 hours upon complete charge.2. Bass & Overall Volume : I was aware of its low bass prior purchasing, however the overall sound/volume has also fallen by 20-30% of what it use to be. In 3 months, this product has become nearly useless.3. Poor Noise Cancellation/No noise cancellation : You can‚Äôt use these to make phone calls, unless it‚Äôs 3 am at night. Even if you try, the other person barely hears you but everything around you like vehicle honkings, dog barks.Summary : I‚Äôm not even comparing this product to any other brand or any other product of the same brand. Simply the way it worked 3 months ago for which I have given 2 stars, it fails to do so now.So guys, either save your money and skip this or save some more and get something else."
Think twice before buying!!!,3.0,"I also own a Bose premium headphones which I think I cannot wear everyday to gym, so I bought this product for my day to day workouts. Comparing it with Bose, sound is not that crisp but for a Bluetooth earphone under 2k it worth it. I really like the beats and sound is pretty awesome too.Full marks for that, but I find it pretty annoying while working out in gym. There is a U shaped clip at the end of which two wires are attached which connects to earphones. The sturdy clip has to hang round your neck all the time. If you are running, the clip might start rotating and that would slowly force one of the earbud come of your ear. Pretty annoying...believe me, you have to turn the clip time and again to hang it around your neck in correct position. Also, while doing ab crunches it will keep on falling back and take both the earbuds along with it.I was mislead with the pictures, I thought it is all wire and no clip but its not. Just wanted to point this out so you dont make the same mistake ;)But if you are not into too much workout and want it for travel, then connection range and awesome beats is great deal.Cheers."
Poor quality.. no clear sound,1.0,"This is the worst thing,  i buy at amazon...i already bought 2 earphones of boat rockerz 255 pro,  they both were good but not better than tagg inferno.. still the sound quality was good,  base n noise cancellation was ok...So i bought this earphones,  keeping in mind that they will be of some lesser quality than 255  pro but just after 10 min of use.. i knew they are  like some local earphones... even after with maximum volume on my phone... i m not able to hear clearly... forget about the noise cancellation n sound while i m eating...  i was not expecting the same with boat vompany...either this earphones are defective or this is the inbuilt poor quality... i don't know...I even don't want to use them.. but there is no refund policy... only replacement is available..i suggest everone please do not buy this.. even after that.. i would say avoid boat product... because my boat stone speaker 1000 also show poor performance just after 1 year of very low usage.. Hopefully boat rockerz 255 pro earphones which i bought fr my brother approx 6 months back..  will not show d same poor performance.."
Noise cancellation not upto mark,4.0,"Ordered this product at 699 (03-october-2021) in Great Indian festival sale of Dussehra received on October 7th 2021It is 5 days now still 60% available.I take calls for 8-11 hours a day as I'm a stock brokerNoise cancellation is poor. Everything will be heard.Bass is good in full volume, but when volume increases battery will drown fast, as it is argued to be best at 40 hours with 50%voulme level.With full volume my brother usually getting 11 hours battery backup.Overall it is a good productI'd rate 3.5/5Only con is noise cancellation."
okay okay ... please replace it,3.0,"well, i have brought this product four months back... good buy.. i brought it for 1499/-i would suggest to buy this at this price which is currently stating..999/-sound quality is good what all i needed, apart from this battery life is enough good around 6 hrs.In 4 months right side is not working... now i want to replace this immediately as this is something not expected...really not satisfied with it...giving 3 stars as its good in sound &  battery.."
Good Product,5.0,Overall product is good. Works flawlessly in all conditions. I would rate 5/5 on overall performance. But sound quality for listening music is 4/5. For Music enthusiast bass quality is slightly not up to the mark. But for a general user its the best and Im overall satisfied with the product. I highly recommend the product for day to day usage.
Bluetooth connection failure on this headset,3.0,Hey guys...I have purchased this Bluetooth headset 50 days back.... Boss and trouble is okay not very good as like I heard that boat is awesome brands for these all things but not getting all things good...and now I am getting some issue as like battery life and most important thing is that when I am start to using this headset then not able to hearing proper music and video....voice is coming sometime not coming...I mean Bluetooth connection is going automatic off and on....that is very big problem I am facing....I have not excepted this type of major issues on this brand....can anyone help me please
Not worth buying........,2.0,"Worst experience... Not worth buying at all... Gifted to my husband last yr... One headphone stopped working, charging started draining off quickly, everything bfr 6 months,. N when m trying customer care for replacement as it's in warranty.. no response even aftr compliaing.. Disappointed by boats company customer service and product...."
Good Product - Can Buy,4.0,"This is a very good product, but if you can buy Boat Rockers 255 Pro,then you should go for that product. It has amazing clarity & is a completely value for money earphone. This is why I was able to give this product a 4 star rating whereas I have given a 5 star rating for Boat 255 Pro..Also, if you are buying this piece, always do that during the sale time as the price lowers down to 999."
It's is the best and the worst reasons,4.0,This headphone is the best but it is fake that it supports apxt it only supports SBC and AAC but mobile gives warning of AAC audio codec may break the audio so some times it gives low quality and if in AAC Mode bass is 6/10 and in SBC bass is 10/10 but if you are playing BGMI in SBC mode it will give a bass effect to guns like m24 and awm and footstep in SBC is 0/10 and footstep in AAC is 9/10 and i recommend to play games in AAC mode which really gives 3D audio and if you want to hear music I recommend keep the settings to SBC and one more thing if you hear the music in AAC mode then you will need to hear there music in 80% volume and one more thing if your are watching video or trailer or games then AAC mode is the best I was watching Trailer of spiderman no way home in AAC mode in full volume I was feeling I was in theater. Latency is very good or the best in AAC mode and worst in SBC and about the quality it may break within 1 to 2 years or within 1 year if you will not use it properly I recommend using boat neckband instead of ROUND CHEAP HEADPHONE OF BOAT
Excellent Sound Quality at this Price,5.0,"This is my second purchase of Boat Rockerz 255. The earlier one is being used by my wife. I went to Reliance Digital to purchase some other headphone. I almost finalized on some other product when i got demo of this product. It was way better than what i had planned to buy. To differentiate i listen to the 3D Barber shop video on YouTube. On comparison, this definitely got more points. This is one product i always advocate for. Using it for three month, will post long use review after a year of use. Wires from the unit to ear could have been short though."
"Review after using , worth reading",5.0,"I'm writing this review after 7 months of purchase...I think we shouldn't write review for such items too early....here is the review..#Advantages- 1. AWeSOME sound quality  2 . Pocket friendly (only@999 during sale, 1399 or sometime 1499)  3. Lightweight to carry anywhere  4 . Fantastic colour varients available.# Shortcomings - 1. Sometimes doesn't connect with device , takes too much time( usually after charging).2. Multiple devices- connectivity doesn't function properly...3. Very short range ( 10-15 meters in real)"
Waste of money,1.0,"I purchased these earphones about a year back after reading the great reviews on Amazon. The first thing I noticed is that the bass and noise cancellation were really poor.Initially, there wasn't much of an issue apart from these two things. Eventually, the battery started getting drained very quickly despite charging them regularly. After a few months, I started facing connectivity issues. I had to reconnect them to my phone every few minutes.Overall, I'm not happy with these earphones. I'd recommend the OnePlus Bullets over these."
Best Bluetooth neckband,5.0,"After a month's usage,Pros:1. Clear Music, Clear Voice, Good Noise cancellation in Mic.2. Excellent Range crosses 15m radially, I'm using it in a place where there are many interfering devices in 2.4GHz band.3. Good Bass, but not the best4. Connects 2 devices at a time, but plays from one at a time.5. No random disconnection, used for long hour calls with Windows laptop and Mobile too.6. Battery life is around 8 - 10 hrs, depends on call duration, and volume level.7. Comfort on ears, very light weight. Choose earbud size accordingly.Cons:1. I paid Rs.1490/-, while in 5 days price was Rs.1049/- and now again it Rs.1499, so watchout for price before buying.2. Battery indication on your mobile for this device, shows 100 to 80 then directly to 0 sometimes, or 100 to 80 to 60 to 0.3. Charging time is clearly 1hr 40min. Which is 1hr in 255 Pro. Still not a Con hereNote: Do not use while riding 2 Wheeler(not recommended too), Mic area here is exposed to air or else covered up within your Helmet, so the on other side your voice will be heard with lot of wind noise/disturbed/feeble."
Excellent for everything you need including casual gaming,5.0,Writing this review after 1.5 Weeks. This is an amazing product especially the sound quality and bass. On heavy usage (6-8 hours a day) this earphone should last for a week which no other earphone under 2000 can offer.If you do casual gaming then this is okay for you but if you are a hard-core gamer then can't recommend. While Playing BGMI/PUBG the earphone behaved weirdly with footprints but other games like Clash Royale or COC and even Call of DutyMobile this game is amazing (if your phone supports APTX the experience may be better). This earphone also has some kind of passive noise cancelling which is good. It is good for cycling and walking and Bluetooth range is more than advertised. Inside a house the range is 20-25 metres. Outside home in open area the range can go upto 50 metres (yeah I tested it).Mic quality is really good no problem with calls.If I get 50 upvotes I may be updating the review after 2 months.
"Good, but isn't great!",4.0,"Sound quality is excellent..noise cancellation is great and bass as well..but the problem is with the connectivity..I use these earphones on my OnePlus 7T and this earphone disconnects just beyond 10 ft..One more prob is, when the battery reduces to 20%, it automatically disconnects from my phone on its own! Battery life isn't bad, isn't good either..can run for 6 hrs in a single charge! If you can spend ‚Çπ500 extra, can go for OnePlus bullets wirelesss Z!!Edit: the battery is turning out to be awful as the days pass by. Even when the battery stands around 60%, I get to hear ""low battery"" indication for few times and it goes off! Bit disappointed!"
review after 6 month use,5.0,"decent battery lifei am not into heavy bass and awsome sound clarity so i dont care much about music quality. but i can say that one can live the music quality but if you are music buff and looking for some high end earphones like bose or beats or high-end sony in your mind, this is definitely not for you.mic works wellbt connectivity is good and pairs parallelly with multiple devicesbetter than ear buds as these earphone works with helmet and body is also of good qualityi feel comfortable to wear these while workout with the exception of running.while running you should put this inside shirt to avoid the neckpiece from jumping and create annoyance but i never had issue of ear buds coming out of ear during workoutbut sometimes i feel battery life could have been even better"
The best neckband available.,4.0,"The sound quality is great with 3d surround effect and the color is great. However the main and probably the selling point of this Bluetooth neckband is, it promises 40 hrs of continuous backup, at mid volume when fully charged. And it's not just to say or claim; it delivers that much backup without a doubt. I am a heavy user and still a charge it after 3-4 days. My previous tws needed a recharge almost thrice in two days. So, a relief there and it has dual pairing option too (which was also missing in my previous TWS earbuds). It definitely is a great buy at this price and have purchased a total of 3 for my family members and myself and recommended to one of my friends as well; she too likes and loves it üòú and not to forget about the after sale service boat offers; it's incredible. Have been using boat products since last 2-3 years and had a great warranty experience as well, barring one last year during the lockdown.So, overall it's a good earphone to go with and you will love it for sure üëç"
Issue with the right side bud,3.0,"When I started to use the earphone, irritating sounds were coming from the right side bud. As the replacement period was not over I requested for replacement and the Amazon team did their best to replace the unit as soon as possible. But now the replaced fresh unit is also began to show the same issue.Irritating sounds are coming from the right side bud. When I gone through the review section many have mentioned defects about the right side bud. So the right side have got something serious issue.Manufacture should definitely look into that.Now I am going to return the product to buy any other brand. Note that sound quality and battery backup are pretty good."
Product with gradual defects,2.0,"Boat is building its products to look like stylish and solid. I got this teen green bluetooth earphone which I was happy with the style, decent sound features. But the real problem started once you use the product for sometime. Within 3 months the ear buds, ear support have started become loose and getting out. Now just after 1 year, one side of the earphone has stopped working. So they make these products with less durability and aims for usability of around 1 year max. Then there is no point of buying these well showed off brands...I would recommend not to buy this product if you are looking for a earphone with proper use with minimal problems. You can buy this product for lesser use and delicate usage purposes."
Good at what it does!,4.0,"This bluetooth headset is a nice one. After almost 1.5 years of usage, it is still doing a great job.The box contained the boAt Rockers and three pairs of ear-tips ranging from small to large size.The battery life is not amazing but it can suffice for a full working day with a lot of calls and streaming internet content. Battery is still in good shape.It shows battery percentage in multiples of 20. For example, after 100%, it will show 80% directly. No issues with that.The bluetooth range is decent. It tends to disconnect when the device it is connected to is say, a room away.The microphone quality is also decent because no one complained about it.It is certainly not the absolute best in terms of audio quality. This department is highly subjective but, a pure, neutral sound cannot be expected because of the emphasized bass which I enjoyed. The mid-tones and the high-tones tend to get muffled a little bit but then, that's what we must expect from any earphone that has added bass to it. It is definitely enjoyable.There exists latency but it's negligible. One might not notice it unless exclusive attention is paid to the same.If you want that added bass and neutral sound isn't your cup of tea, you can check it out!Noise cancellation doesn't make a major difference because the ear-tips are in-ear style.However, it has a micro-USB port that it uses to charge.However, with the likes of Realme Wireless Buds, OnePlus Z and Oppo Enco in the market, this is not the best buy but it's still a good buy if you're very tight on budget. But 1.5 years ago, it was definitely a great buy.Cheers!"
One of best budget Wireless,5.0,"Well after using Boat Rockerz 400, JBL, Motorola i bought this one and its defiantly worth buying in this range. Bass is average not too much nor less. Looks premium and best quality build. If you got budget 2k buy any Rocekerz from Boat and must read all details. This one is Good for outside coz IPX7"
Worthy earphones under 1000,4.0,"Updating after using for 1 year:Best under ‚Çπ1000, premium quality bass and noise vancellation, fits good in ear. 3 different sized buds are given.Cons:1. Not suitable to put on during sprint run. Best for music lovers during jogging and walk.2. Most common problem i.e., either side of buds stop working. In my case, it happened after 11 months due to invisible internal wire connection cut off."

Only for listening music not recommended for calling,2.0,"ProVoice quality is good and bass is also good.BUTThe con is -1. Its range is very less. Maybe 1 or 2 meter. Thats the lowest quality Bluetooth range exist.If you move 2 meter away from phone then the earphone is useless.2. Noise cancellation is very bad, when on call , the person on other side will hear more noise than your voice. This need to correct as it is impossible to use it for calling in little noisy environment forget about more noisy."
Music quality is good with worst mic,2.0,"Hi,Any Update on this Ticket number is 1107094?please let me know when I can expect my product?I have tried to reach New Customer service number +91-2249461882 its not working. can amazon help me on this?and also written email to support@imaginemarketing.freshdesk.com; info@imaginemarketingindia.com; help@imaginemarketingindia.com  their is no response.boAt Rockerz 255 what I have brought from amazon have issue now I have written a mail to claim warranty to boat,From BoAt they collected headphone on May 23rd 2020, after that there is no response even I have tried to reach customer care of boat but none numbers are working,BOAT Ticket number is 1107094"
Boat rockerz 255 actually ROCK,5.0,"Hello, boat rockerz had been in my cart from 4 month. I was waiting for good deal. Once i ordered but it saw out of stock. This time i grab th deal. Boat rockers 255 is super awesome sounds quality ( better than expected ) as they said bass is very good too and even noise cancellation is well define. You cant compare this with rs. 4000-5000 product. All i want to tell you that boat rockerz 255 gives double compair to it's price.As many of the buyers said thier box was opened .....mine was perfectly seal. (Sold by : appario retail private ltd.)"
It stopped working in 3 months!!,1.0,"In less than 3 months this speakers are dead. Cant use them as the battery is dead. goes from no charge to full charge in 5-7 min and doesn't get switched on at all. what a useless product and complete waste of money. Now three months down the line cant return as well.. !!!Thought, boat was a sensible and good company selling genuine stuff... was fooled."
Best Bluetooth Earphones !! Go for it. You won't regret.,5.0,"The best Bluetooth headphones I have ever used. The Best in this price category.Pros:1. Unbelievable battery backup. I am getting 1 day battery stand by. I use in office from 9 am to 7 pm then the battery lasts throgh out the night.2. Best fit. The earpieces will not fall out how hard you shake your head.3. Light weight. It is so light weight you can not feel the band on your neck.4. Stylish look.5. Magnetic parts on the earpieces make them stick together.Cons:1. Sometimes you feel like the wire is lengthy.2. There is a voice notification when calls come ""incoming call"". It would have been superb if the voice notification says the contacts names."
Can be better but definitely needs improvement.,4.0,"I had ordered it because I had expected more from it. This is my second Bluetooth inear headphone (first was the old LG HBS 730, mind-blowing device). Anyways, the sound is OK - not bad but not good. Noise cancellation is good, voice call audio quality is clear to the other end, the buttons are good but can be more tactile.My only gripe is that the music audio quality can be better. Bass should be more powerful and the mids, treble should be a bit more clear and refined.Also, I suggest that they should add the two volume buttons + call connect/disconnect button at the left side +  a vibration motor and keep the right side only for multimedia buttons (play/pause/rewind/next/previous).But, since the price was much less in Amazon sale (below 800), it is only fair for the quality we get. I will hope they fix all this and release their next version, even the price is higher."
Good earphone but now have problem within 8 months of purchase,3.0,"The product has a waranty of 1 year (My purchase is in July 2019,  now May 2020). My one side earphone is not working now after use of 8 months. I use this mostly for office calls and movie watching. Seems to me not long lasting product.Now I'm residing in Bangalore where Govt marked as Corona red zone, and want to raise a complaint on warrenty. But what i hear is that, we must visit service center for warrenty claims.I'm OK with this but why not register complaint online and then visit center? If the lockdown continued more and i might miss warrenty period to claim the same.Please first take the complaint online and that means the defective product is highlighted and we can then visit the store later for replacement or repair.I'm writing this as a proof of defective product that i have. Also  i spoke to service center (DVG road Bangalore - 09886114663) and recorded the call for future reference."
Value for money but quality of material average,3.0,"Good value for money,nice battery..we ca say long battery life upto 40hrs(30-35 hrs medium use,25-30 hrs high use,20-25 extreme use actual)..nice color..nice fittings.ConsWarrenty not covered some places. Registration process is not good in any boat products. so it is not exceptional.. sometimes customer care service is remain silent or inactive.After registration of complaint..pick up service is very average.sometimes almost zero..I am using this almost 3 months but confirmation of registration Emil or sms not received yet...So buy it at your own risk.but product is good.. overall 3 stars.. registration is biggest con.."
Sound & battery great but Build is fragile,4.0,"Used for 6 days.Liked -Clear call qualityGreat battery lifeEasy pairingGood range for connectivityDidn't like  -Build quality. Wire quality not good as per the price range. When you wear it, appearance is not that great because wire hangs around the face wierdly unlike other brands. Not stylish but sound quality is good."
Not satisfactory. Total waste of money.,1.0,"+ Really pathetic customer service. Called thousands of time at their fort store but no one answers. Even if some one answers they don't service properly. Received call from some pratik guy he said he will ask someone to call but it's been more than 3 to 4 weeks no update. AVOID  BOAT.. VERY VERY BAD BRAND AND AFTER SALES SERVICE..+ The ear grips get too loose. I have already lost one, ther is no support from BOAT customer service team.  The performance is not upto the mark. Doesn't work when the phone is kept in the pocket.Range of bluetooth breaks after couple of meters.Total waste of money."
must buy,4.0,"got it for 999 in prime deal dayGood sound outputbattery lasts about 5 hours at a stretchsound quality good for music - okayish for callsThe ear grip does not let this fall off even while on treadmill/ joggingnot heavy on the neckbuttons are easy to operateonce paired to your phone - connects instantly the next time you switch it onbluetooth range- two average room sizeGreen Black is a better vibrant colour , then plain black  or red black"
Add 400 bucks more and go for one plus,2.0,Cons:1.Cheap built quality.2.Continuous hissing sound when not playing any music3.Continuously blinking blue light.4.Sound quality is average.Pros1.beast battery2.good bass
Worst Product and Terrible after service,1.0,"The Product is very average and couldn't sustain for 4 months of normal use. Started giving issues with one ear piece . Buttons are also quite delicate . Thus contacted the Boat Service center, they arranged for the pick up and all. However its been over 20 days there has been no update. Despite several reminders over email. Funny part is the customer care number doesn't work only. Pathetic service and worst company. There are many good head phones are in the market go with those brands. Please do not go for this one as you will be conned for sure."
"Product is good, service is worst in India",1.0,"Product is good, works as expected and if and when the product fails to work, please do not, DO NOT ever give it to Boat service center. I am waiting since over 2 months, they do not reply to mails, customer service calls also not fruitful, they just read out status. Very bad experience.On their website, they write #1 service, laughable.Pl get it repaired locally, the product is not worth the wait to get repaired from such worst service center who don't even care to reply. Checkout internet for such customer harassment where many others are suffering.Super pathetic service."
Boat - 100% customer heart winner,5.0,Boat produces best quality products & I appreciate their warranty policy.Just before 10 days of warranty expiry I found one of the ear pieces is not working & I asked for replacement they accepted for repair/replacement. They find fault with the earpiece & they sent me a new one as a replacement.I am very happy with your customer relationship.I will definitely recommend boat to everyone & also I want to purchase ur new airdopes.
Good but not best in budget,3.0,I have bought it 4-5 days ago and i am not happy with this. there are few point noticeable .1) Audio Quality - is Good but not very nice as it have over Bass. so you cant feel the song. you need to adjust the levels.2) Fitting - cause it is light and not flexible this wont stay at your neck. i can drop very easily if you are riding bike or running. also the earbud are very big in size.3) Charging/Battery - i did charged it more then one time for now as its new so i am not sure how long it is gonna work. but i feel that the charging port is only working with its cable only (as it has universal charging port so it should charge with any mobile charger also)overall good but expensive according to its quality.
Decent quality for the price,4.0,"This wireless Bluetooth stereo headset is of decent quality for its sizeHigh frequency sound is reproduced fairly transparentlyMid ranges are decent tooLow end bass is a bit boomy for my likingAt first look, the piece is well made and seems durable. Only time and usage shall tell.Do note that the neck band, while being flexible can't be rolled like a wire. So don't buy one of the round cases with the hope of fitting the headset into it."
Good product.,3.0,"Overall good quality as expected from boat but nothing wow factor is there.. bass level could be more better.. only battery performance, water resistant level is great. I would recommend to buy rockerz 255 pro which is already available in more cheap price.."
Best buy under 1500,5.0,"You need not to look for any other product if you are looking for earbuds in this range. In amazon sale I got it for 899/-. I even own wings earpods worth 3999/-Trust me this pair compete with wings premium quality earpods.. Super base, awesome sound quality and excellent notice cancellation with comfortable to ears.. I selected this pair after searching almost 15 items and m happy with this one."
Read carefully,3.0,"Please read carefully1. The earphones look good and are light weight but the design of the eartips is disgusting , they are very hard and are not perfectly bended at an angle2. I can not wear them for not more then 1 hr3. The battery is not good as shown I am getting only 4 hrs of playback4. The sound quality is average  it is not of a 1600 rs earphones kinda like the 600 rs realme buds noice. Cancellation is averageSo think twice before u buyAlso I got the left wire tangled and after 2 days it is not coming in it's original position"
Very good product.,5.0,"Very cheap product. And voice quality is very much higher it displace full voice in ear üëÇ.I have used Skullcandy inkd wireless but the voice is very slow in comparison of this wireless. It comes with 20 min fast charging and cable and 2 extra earmuffs. If you have to fill charge and you have time you have to charge it for 1 hours. 6 hours music playback time continuous upto 10 hours . Power off stand-by time 24 hours. Comes with IPX7 water resistant facility. Very good facility. Light weight sport product. Extraordinary colours. Comes with Qualcomm chipset. Charging compartment is on side that's great. Many versions available in market comfortable design. When an call came on your mobile it says ""Incoming call"" until you receive or reject it. Backup is very good. One thing is cord have to reverse upside from the compartment in order to make for to adult neck and years. Very great product in cheaper rate."
Very good product with one drawback,3.0,"Though it can connect with two devices simultaneously, you cannot use it for same. If it connects with mobile first then it cannot connect with laptop. So first disconnect from mobile, restart Bluetooth of laptop, then you can connect with laptop first and after that with mobile.And for people working from home and taking RDP access of office should not dual connect this with laptop and mobile. There will be 10-15 second latency for RDP response or many time disconnections, if connected to laptop and mobile simultaneously.But yes, sound quality is very good for the price. And battery backup is unbelievable. After one full charge, It lasts for 4 days with 50-60 % volume usage."
Boat is worth to money paid,4.0,"Recently I bought this product for Rs 1399, I have received the product one day earlier to the delivery date. The connectivity of the product is good but the range of the product is upto 10 meters. There is no any noise disturbance in the product and the sound quality, bass and the clarity in sound is impeccable.We can connect to two devices at a time, where we can switch from laptop to phone when there is a call on phone.The material over the neck is not much flexible, there is chances of breaking and the wires are bit long.One interesting thing was the delivery boy was using gloves, mask and was carrying a sanitizer in the pandemic lockdown due to Corona virus outbreak."
awesome sound and bass quality awesome power back,5.0,1- box got damaged i expected it would be fake and already used later when i opend and easily to connect and it connects and plays above 10 mts sound is awesome and bass but i wont say noice cancellation1-for sound ill give 5 stars2-for base 5 stars3-noice cancellation 4 starsfirst of all i like the battery persentagethey mention only 6 hrs play back with full charge but i personally experienced it came 11hrs play back continuously thats why i fiddajust i upset with box damage but any way we wont take any boxnxt when comparing to quality it is awesomeextra earmuffs are came but it is not looking good just old black colour but i had already stylish red earmuffsi attached to that now it came awesome looknx when we compare to charging correctly 1hr30 min it takes but gives 11hrsso i suggest u can buy directlyif u effort more u can buy boat 225 pro i think it would be awesome
Best for connecting tv or mobile,4.0,"I'm using it with my fire tv or mobile and it works well, not heavily into music so not sure about bass and other related aspect.While used in mobile call and it perform well without any call cut or any other disturbing voice and no caller raised any issue for voice issues, I also own one other board bluetooth speaker so sound, connectivity and durability is good even here in this device magnetic earphone and wire are of good build.so if you want to use it for tv or mobile viewing and some calls then you can go for it."
Great Sound. Poor Mic,3.0,"This is first time I have bought a wireless neckpiece.After receiving the product I started testing it's Sound quality. And it gives awesome sound along with good Bass.But.... When I started calling using this, became very disheartened.Very very very poor Mic condition. To whome I was calling they are unable to listen to me clearly.Then I replaced the item and got the new item. New item also giving the Mic issue.Very unfortunate from a renowned company like Boat.I am returning this product!"
Good headphone but very bad battery experience. Hope it is replaced.,3.0,From last one week the battery has suddenly stopped working. It does not work for more than 5 mins and charge does not report above 60% when connected even after 2 hours of charging. It was perfectly fine for 2+ months with around 45 mins of continuous playback time and around 6 hours of standby time. Please replace the battery or provide new unit. I had a lot of hope from BoAt Rockers brand on long and reliable operation Thanks
Review after using one month. Consider before buy,3.0,Review after one monthI bought it in 899rs during sale.good sound quality.Good bass.Noise cancellation is good.Build quality is average. Doesn't give premium look.Keys work fine.Battery is not enough if your using all day.As per my experience it works upto 4 hours. If it decrease to 40% then it will work for 15 minutes max.It's only problem I faced yet.
GREAT PRODUCT üëçüèª,5.0,"This is by far the best Bluetooth earphone at this price segment. I have used almost 7-8 bluetooth earphones & this one is best.The sound quality is great, bass is just perfect & above all it has a good noise cancellation quality (many people doesn't go for thia feature but yes it's a great feature to have in this budget).I highly recommend this one to everyone."
"Useless for jogging, Wi-Fi gets slow down or stop working when it's connected",1.0,"It's not good for jogging! Don't buy, if you want to use it for jogging! I wasted my money for this stupid bluetooth earphones! They start falling down again and again when you start running üèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èI found out new problems with this Bluetooth headset, Wi-Fi doesn't work or slow down when I connect it for listening to songs! üòëüòíüò≠"
Rocking Sound for a Cheaper Price.,4.0,"I bought it for 899 rs during Amazon Big Billion Sale. Amazon delivered it on time. I am writing this review after one week of usage.*Pros*1. It's light weight and easy to use.2. It can be paired with your phone very easily.3. Sound quality is punchy and it has decent noise cancellation too.4. Call quality over this earphones are great and no one complained from the other end.5. It's cheaper than most other competitors at this quality range.6. It is great to use without the protruding rubber ear petal holder. So, remove it and use.7. The battery with stood almost for 4-5 hours average.*Cons*1. The battery percentage option of the Bluetooth earphones on your phone might show 100% for some time and it may jump to 80% after a while. It can't be trustworthy, because it may suddenly jump to 20% and may turn off immediately. So, never trust this battery percentage option.2. It has a decent range of Bluetooth connectivity, if you move 5 feet away, you may experience sudden dip in the quality of music or call and the clarity deteriorate.3. The ideal charging Ampere is not mentioned in the user manual. People may tend to use high Ampere chargers and ruin the battery.4. ""People also bought together"" suggestion for a pouch along with this earphones is misleading. I bought that zip pouch and you can't keep this earphones inside that small pouch. Because, the neckband of this earphones can't be rolled or curled or bent.*Final Verdict*Go for it, to experience a decent pair of Bluetooth earphones at this cheaper price point."
Cheap price comes at a cost,1.0,"For 999, this Boat Rocker is rock solid. Pairing it to my phone and laptop simultaneously. Google Assistant works but to ask to play music you have to unlock the phone. Will review the battery life later which seems promising for my usage. The earbud and hook also fit in my ears properly.Update: After 7 months of usage, the charge port malfunctions, and now after fully charged, it just won't start.  I was hoping it to last at least a year."
Bass based headphone,4.0,Boat Rockers : Mainly concentrated on heavy bass in equalizer bas mode is excellent. But other modes are just like normal headphone sound. Battery back up excellent i mean on full volume [100%] exactly gives 6hours music playback. And normal very low 30-40% volume gives playback upto 9-10hours. Disadvantages of all Bluetooth device is need to charge every day we don't have enough time to charge our cellphone these days who else will plug both device and Bluetooth headset at a time for charging. Please go for wired headphones.
Only One side is working at the end of 7th night,1.0,"Bought it recently, got it delivered on 7:30 pm 17th Nov, 2021. Using it since then working fine. But all of a sudden only right side of earphone is working and left side is not working anymore. No physical damage, no mishandling, used it 5 mins earlier it was fine and at the very next moment its gone. I feel like being cheated to be honest.The funniest part is I never thought of returning it even though its music quality is not that good, but now I had to, so when I checked the returning policy today, Nov 25th, the window gets closed last night only, Nov 24th.I mean is it planned or something!!! That with 7 days return policy item it will work fine till 7 days only? I am feelings so cheated now can't say anything.I request Amazon Customer Support or Boat customer care to help me out in this. I don't know where to go now."
Wifi Reconnecting Issue..,2.0,"If our phone is connected to both wifi and boat blutooth headset, WiFi automatically disconnects after the phone detects boat headset and later WiFi automatically reconnects...and this goeson. I don't know why this product has reconnectivity issue ... review after 10 days of purchase.. If there is any option to return the product definitely i will return this Wifi cancelling product."
Okay but need few tweaks.,4.0,"Some disturbance always comes through speaker after hearing some message tone or some music. I don't what it is. It's kind of some electric leftover pulse discharged a some kind of sound through the speaker.Also when ever I cut the call, automatically music starts. Where I never played a music before the call.Rest is fine. Bluetooth connectivity is good. If we receive a call in one mobile and cut , it automatically switches to other mobile if any call is waiting there. That I really loved."
Absolute Garbage,1.0,Received the product with a broken seal. The box inside was dirty and the battery was dead. Charged it up and paired but sounds terrible. High bass and treble. Bought it as a gift. I'm unable to return it for a refund. It's only offering a replacement. I'd rather discard this and forget about it instead of getting a replacement. Please stay away. and the delivery guy tossed it inside my house when we weren't home.
Good one ‚ô•Ô∏èLoved it,4.0,"The color looks same in the picture shown and also looks classy. It has good noise cancellation. It‚Äôs definitely a go for those who are looking for a BT at this cost. Sometimes if I wear it for too long it‚Äôs paining, like more than 4 hrs or 3 hrs . It has a very good grip and not falling of frequently.The best part about this headphones which I like is that it has a auto sensor to power off the headphones when it is not connected to the phone."
not a very great item,3.0,"while the sound quality is satisfactory, this earphone is very poor in terms of connectivity. even with the mobile in hand, the bluettoth connection keeps breaking. the battery indication is also very superficial. just after 60% it suddenly goes down to 10% within 10 mins  the shape of neckband is also not very convinient for use during jogging. it tends to come out . overall it is not a very great product for the price. ine must try sony or even mi."
Poor battery... Think before buy,2.0,"I am a regular customer of Amazon and I bought this Boat rockerz Bluetooth headset after seeing some positive reviews and Indian product.  But unfortunately it is a Chinese product and imported and  repacked in India. Sound quality,  noise cancellation etc are good but the real drawback is battery.  You have to charge multiple times in a day to enjoy this headset otherwise it is of no use.  This is biggest drawback of this product.  Better to buy a wired headset instead of this.An honest buyer.Thanks"
Good Buds for the price But Extremely poor customer service,2.0,"So i have used this bluetooth headset for a month as my daily driver, left side speakers just stopped one day while listening to music so i logged a complaint with customer service and they came to pickup the defective one in next 2 days, after that from last 15 days i didn't heard back from them, even the customer care numbers is useless since nobody picks up the call there. till date i have not received my replacement or repaired headset. overall good headset considering the price but extremely pathetic customer service towards customers from OEM, I would suggest rather go for Phillips, Sony, Mi or any other reputed  brand since they provide excellent customer satisfaction."
So far absolutely PLEASURE to own these pair of earphone!,5.0,"I have been using this earphone since a week now, the overall experience is just superb. Few advantages below:  - It easily get connected to 2 devices simultaneously  - amazing noise cancellation  - On/Off voice instructions  - Paired or UnPaired voice instructions  - One full charge can last more than 2 days (depends on usage hours from person to person)  - Once paired, it easily gets connected with iPhone or Android device. We don't have to explicitly search name and click to establish connection.  - Overall sturdy build quality and durable material, feels very good and light weight.I am enjoying my music on this earphone, BOAT: Job well done, Kudos!"
Long term review of an awesome earphone,5.0,"I'm writing this review after having used this earphone for mora than 20 months. Its been used while jogging too and it's still working top notch. Noise cancellation is good, sound quality and bass is beyond compare. I would say it was definitely a good investment. Have bought the newer airdopes for my sister which just look better but this is my go to earphone for video conference. Buy wiithout a second thought. Only downside is the usb 2.0 charging in an era where all my devices have a type c charger."
Good not very good,3.0,"It's been a month, I'm using these earphones.The product is good, still I would say for this price it could have been better.It's solid & has very good sound quality.Easy to carry & smart looking but it sometimes takes a lot of time to connect with my phone & the part of it which holds it into the ear got loose already & it got out of ear a few times.. on the charging point of view it work pretty well.. 30 mnts charging is enough more than 3-4 hours continues use. All & all it's good but a lil expensive."
Best if used for listening to songs alone...,4.0,"The headphone is really good until you are using it for listening to songs but not good taking calls, as it doesn't cancel the outside noise and the surrounding noise is more audible than our own voice to the receiver.. but it is best for gym purpose as it completely covers the ears and no other noise from the surrounding disturbs while listening to songs and also it has a tight and comfortable grip over the ears.."
Okay!,2.0,"The very first thing I would like to mention is that the neck band is very flexible its a go to product for comfortable wearing, its non movable when u plug in your ears ,it will not fall even if ur running ,gym and other routines ,controllable and  smooth product are some pro'sTalking about the con'sif ur a music lover u will not find it attractive because its bass is okay upto 70/80% vol rise beyond that would be difficult,pairing issuesNoise canceling i would give 4.5/5  make sure while ur on a call put it in a 50/60% vol till 70% is appropriate beyond that would not be better!!"
Amazing purchase with some acceptable cons,3.0,"Review edit -after 3 months.Buttons stopped working after 3 months.Have to press hard to operate.Product quantity is below acceptable level at this price point.Amazing purchase.Pros -Sound (lows, highs, miss) good and acceptable.Bass is amazing. Thump is good and feels like premium.Ease of use - pairing is quick, everytime.Cons -Battery is a little bit below acceptable limit.Helmet fit - possible if you have loose fitting helmet like Vega crux front opening helmet.But not possible with Vega ryker/bolder series as these helmets have tight fit."
One of the best bluetooth headphones in this price range,4.0,"I purchased it one month back after comparing it with so many products. But to my surprise noice cancellation , bass and sound quality of the product is just amazing. Even compared with JBL LIVE200BT which costs around 4200 , this headphone is far better than JBL one.just go for it if you want to have a good wireless headphones in this price range.Only Con i came across is the battery indicator is not working properly it suddenly jumps from 40 percent to low battery but actual battery life is as claimed around 6-7 hours"
Average product.Poor connectivity reach . Loses connection easily,3.0,Not an hour has passed and I started disliking boat rockers headphones . It's poor connectivity that is the main reason. I tried it over call and played music but it has poor connectivity. On call it has a reach of  meters only which is very less this means we have to carry phone in pocket everytime. While playing music it has connectivity upto 6-7 meters but if you change rooms in-between the connection loses. Though sound quality is good. Overall product is average though is also cheap. So a nice tradeoff. I give 3 star .
Good Quality Product.,5.0,"boAt Rockerz 255 Pro, while being lightweight in design pumps out your favorite tunes with powerful HD sound and deep boosted bass. The 10mm drivers installed to ensure that you get an exceptional sound experience with articulate audio reproduction with a blend of pitch-perfect frequency response. The sound produced by the boAt Rockerz 255 Pro ensures that you differentiate music from noise and hear your favorite artists the way they were meant to be heard."
Good Only for Listening not for Calling,3.0,For listening to music it‚Äôs very good. In fact Awesome.For making calls its not worth it as People will keep on complaining that they are hearing all surrounding noises better then your voice. May be because of bad location of mic or poor quality of mic.Noise cancellation is just a myth. It doesn‚Äôt happen in this neckband. Infact other person will hear more noises than your voice. But still at ‚Çπ999/- its good... at least you are able to listen to music perfectly.
Must buy product,4.0,"In this price range, its a good one.Earlier I was in doubt that how tha mic may be ?But the mic is so much clear, even its that clear so that the next person can even hear the background noise highly if you are not in silent place.Sound quality is good. Battery backup can be improved. As of now the backup is okay okay.Powering on, incoming call messages are good.Bluetooth connectivity is also good.Overall a very good wireless headphones with mic."
Truly amazing,5.0,"After using around 3-4 months..This is one of the best earphone at this price(‚Çπ999) wait for the offer.Noise cancellation is truly awesome. I m living in a place where the wind speed reduces the speed of the vehicle, and when i was using JBL earphone then the person i was talking to get irritated due to the sound.But this cancels all this wind sounds.And yes bass lovers.. u can expect an average bass as compared to a precious earphones. U can adjust bass through Equalizer if u need more bass"
Overall good at this price,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†For price , this is very good product , I got this product at Rs-1099, and this is original product ,If you also want to know this is original or not , then you follow this step - first if you on the Bluetooth a male voice was came not Chinese and second step when you're connect with phone then there are two options are provided you have to choose sbc codec or aac codec this is sign of original Bluetooth 5.0. üî•üî•üî•üî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Best quality at a pretty good price!,4.0,"Till now I have bought couple of these Earphones, and also recommended it to my many friends. Also I have used Boat's other products too, their USP is the best quality at pretty good price. And about this product, its the Best Bluetooth Earphone to start with. Its Price is really low as compared to other Bluetooth headphones in the market. It has a superior bass quality that one can not get even in higher priced earphones of other brands. Just one con I can say for this earphone is its age, my first one got dead when it just passed 1 year,  but it depends on your usage too. But I will say definitely go for it for its low price and its quality in sound and bass. Boat is really a nice brand, its all products are worth a try!"
Do not expect much. heavy technical issues.,2.0,"a normal quality product. there are some technical issues with it.it automatically disconnects with the paired smartphone when using and connects with some other device if its Bluetooth is ON.do not buy it, if u want to use it with laptops. it won't pair."
A Good deal,4.0,"I was not sure about the product, especially when it comes to under 1500 bracket, but after doing some research, which I'm actually good at i bought these ROCKERZ 255+ PRO. My soul reason was the need of a back up wireless earphone, as i have oneplus buds. Being said all this, these never disappointed me, even on a heavy use. Battery backup is upto the mark, sound quality is average and build quality is not that bad, easily value for money. In this price range i.e.1200-1400, this is the best deal. My review comes after 3 months of use."
"Terrible earphones, horrible sound experience",1.0,"Sub-par audio quality, music sounds like hollow like it's from well, call quality is terrible, game performance is horrible and bass is just too much. Overall a very bad earphones. Please think twice to buy these really horrible earphones ever."
Best quality earphones in an affordable price,5.0,Giving  review after using it for a week.ordered on 16th oct received with in 2 days.brought at a price of rs rs899.sound quality is good.bass is perfect and with immersive sound quality.noise cancelation is too good even when u play audio in low volume level u can't here an external noise. Watching movies and listening songs using this earphones is really a bliss. Bass quality is good. Connecting to device is very fast. Lastly if u want to buy this product then go for it sure.
Pretty awesome.,5.0,"Got mine this Monday, been using ever since and the battery life is simply great, used extensively specially for voice calls for around 6-7hrs a day, music for like 1-2hrs a day and the battery is at 70% now, Boat did awesome with it's battery.Connectivity is pretty quick be it with my phone, pc or both of my LG & Samsung TV's, never had any disconnection issue.It doesnt hurts my ear even after having it on for hours.Noise Cancellation is great on this one, bass I would say is above average.But over all what I liked most about the BT apart from its battery is the call quality, never for once anyone ever complained about call/voice at all.So far the build looks pretty solid but time will tell.For only ‚Çπ1,499 its worth every penny."
"Battery issue, slow charging,too much bass, high latency, slow charging,no proper playback",1.0,"Not enough music back up, whenever you are in a mood to listen music the battery just dies no matter whatever volume. Slow battery charging. Sometimes it's irritating can't relie when u are traveling...thts the biggest issue with this headphones. Not enough range when ur on a call. High latency. If you u have the headphone for more then 4 hrs it has a typical connectivity issue...have to disconnect nd connect again... battery shows 80% which should last for around 4 hrs but dies in no time...it would recommend to not buy this headphones looks fancy but of no use"
Worth Buying,5.0,"It is a good product. It's lightweight and gives amazing sound quality whilst cancelling all outside noise.It is also very handy and the earplugs stick together because of the magnet when you leave them hanging in your neck which helps to keep it from moving too much. The neckband is a little flexible which prevents any discomfort on the back of your neck. It doesn't take much time to charge it and the battery lasts easily for 4-5 hours. You can pick up and disconnect calls and reduce and increase volume. It is also easy to connect to your phone.Overall, it is a good product and one can buy easily."
Product got damaged after 3 months & got good product in return in a very smooth process,4.0,"Using this product since 2 years. & Somewhere in dec 2020, ear phone had some technical issue.Since I had warranty, I had raised a request for exchange. Along with me, one of my colleague also raised a request.Exchange process took around 10 working days but it was very smooth & got timely update on phone & got another product. Overall nice experience with boat rockerzz.Coming to the product, using new earphone from 1.5 years. In WFH, had used this product extensively but didn't faced any technical issue.Audio & mike quality is very good & it fits for everyone. Would recommend everyone to buy it."
Asymmetrical Right Left sound .. please read before you damage your hearing,2.0,Within 3 months of use this earphones is sounding 3 times louder in left ear than right. I manually need to change the right left balance in setting.  This has potential to.damage your hearing especially if you use it in gym as sometimes we tend to not notice this during workouts.Please buy OPPO instead before you damage your hearing in one ear.
Good for workout but can't surely say value for money.,4.0,"I got it at 1299. I do have Sony bass and infinity headphones so comparison will be with them- Delivered before estimated time.- sound quality good (not good at max lvl)- noise cancelation work average.- bass quality is also average.- Build quality is good.- its do charge fastly as they said.- playback is around 6hrs.- overall can't say value for money as now you can purchase airbuds while 100 or 200 extra, but its ok to have it while exercise as less chances of dropping it down."
Not durable...wont purchas a boat product ever,1.0,"This product is really not durable.I would suggest not to purchase this product..i bought them for workout purpose as the company said they are sweat resistant.The sound ,bass and noise cancellation is good.But these earphones are not durable.They malfunctioned 3 times in one year mainly due to battery.And their service procedure is very tiresome.They will send a courier service to your doorstep and then the earphone will be couriered to mumbai after which it will be inspected and get repaired/replaced.It almost takes a month and sometimes 2-3 months.And many people whom i suggested to buy these,their earphones also malfunctioned after sometime.So ots better to opt for some better product than this."
Fair deal,4.0,"My neckband got delivered yesterday and it was on time. The Boat 255 Pro+ was fully charged. I tested it for full one day and from morning to night, it only consumed 20% battery. The sound quality is good though it would've been better if it had bit more bass. The sound is clear while making call with no lag. To sum it up, it's a fair deal. I love it's battery performance and that's what I bought it for."
Good speakers and best battry backup,4.0,Using this for 3 months now . The sound quality is good but not the best .battry back is the main thing in this blutooth even with good quality sound it won't be useful if you have to charge it in some hours but 255 pro Plus has from my use a week worth of charge . On using it almost 10 hrs a day watching movies and all it has a stand by of 5 days . But if you use it just for short period of time but mostly in standby . It will last upto 7 days on single charge . I bought 3 of these for my frnds and family . Mainly for battry backup. It also has good speakers but not the best but it's ok . So no prblm.if you want battry backup go for this without any thoughtüëåüëçüëç.it has the best in class water resistant also . Fast charge in below 45 min for full charge from 0% to 100%. Best for battry.
Excellent earphones,4.0,"Sound quality is good. Build quality is also nice. Its flexible and u can twist  or fold it which is not possible in most of other bluetooth earphonesEdit: I am giving this review and after 10 months. It is still working fine and I carry it around my neck for 10-12 hrs a day for almost 4 days a week. It's bass effect, sound quality and noise cancellation all are well balanced. It's build quality is really awesome and I have recommended to many of my friends."
Bad experience as all 3 got spoilt,2.0,Had ordered 3 pieces for my husband and children  and all hve got spoilt . 2 r not owrkong at all and in q.one one side works .There is no After service of boat company even of it's under warranty . Very bad experience. Called Amazon but they said u hve to go to the boat service center for pick and drop if it can be repaired  which is very far from my place.

"Good ""Made in India"" headset",3.0,"Update -One left ear-piece stopped working 20-Aug-2020. Purchased July 2019.Original review -I read somewhere that BoAt products lead to drop in pricing by JBL, Jabra and others. Now I know why. At much less cost the headset delivers. I am facing a problem in charging. Full 100% charge lasts easily for a day. But next day it shows 80% charge and after a while drops to 20%. I have never seen 75% or 40% charge, it is 100%, 80%, 20% and Off. Will update after contacting customer support."
Best in this segment with unbelievable battery backup,5.0,I am really impressed with battery backup. There is no need to charge for an week even moderate use for call and listen music for couples of hours on daily basis.Quality of material is also very good even though rough use.Sound quality for Music lover is good but not the best as we know Sony is the best for Music qualityOverall I am very satisfied and definitely recommend this product in this range.But if you are planning to purchasing just for listening to Music and budget is not concern then go for Sony
Great wireless Earphones by Boat but battery indicator an issue,5.0,"This a great wireless Earphones and the green color looks really cool. The quality of sound and bass is also satisfactory at this price range. It's worth the price. The charging speed is little bit slow I feel. And with continuous use it can work for like 7 - 8 hours. I felt if the battery life could have been better like if extra 2-3 hours was there then it would have been great. And one issue I found was with the battery indicator for this earphone, it's not that reliable. In just 5 mins the battery indicator which shows 20% suddenly drop to 0%. They could have improved the indicator and made it more reliable and efficient. Otherwise it's a great product."
Disappointing quality,2.0,"This isn't my first Boat earphones and I must say first time I am disappointed with the quality.1. Falls flat on bass... definitely not for bass lovers2. Volume output is pretty low3. Mic quality is an absolute turn off4. Very long wires, feels weird to useReplaced the first piece thinking it was a manufacturing issue but found the same issues with replacement as well so finally returning it."
Received used/damaged product,1.0,"I have purchased this product during great indian sale. Seems like the dealer is interested in selling the damaged products during the sale .I have received either damaged or used product ,the product looks too old and the brand name ‚Äúboat ‚Äú written on the product is faded even the colour of the product is faded and it was in dirty condition full of dust , charging port cap is broken thus missing also both earbuds are different from each other .Worst condition of the product.So much disappointed with this product."
Good bluetooth earphones in a budget segment.,4.0,"Sound quality is decent for both music and call quality. Noise isolation is there bu it can be improved by using the proper set of eartips . Fortunately there are three sets of eartips provided. I am not a bass lover and this earphones produce a lot of boomy bass. It mutes the finer instruments in jazz and new age music.Battery is like 5-6 hours while listening to music. Calling takes much more battery life. And charging is fast. Takes around 1.5 hours to charge fully.One very irritating thing is that at 20% battery level , the headset will inform you almost every 20 secs. We understand that battery level low is to be informed but not so frequently.Also DO NOT go for the aqua color as it's quite different than what it looks in picture. The actual color is quite pale in comparison to it's picture. Thats a big deal. Color should not be misleading."
Worthless,1.0,No idea about the actual product as I received a horrible and defective piece... I have used boAt products earlier but this time the packaging looked like it was opened and used for 3 years and then someone packed and gave it to me... The old was worn out... The seal was non-existent... The left earphone doesn't work and the earphone only switches on when charging... Have been charging for 8 hours still doesn't not switch on if removed from charge... Highly disappointed is an understatement...
Real life experience - overall review!!,3.0,"Cons:1) The build quality of the product is really questionable. There are spaces/gap in between the battery compartment. Hence it does make it vulnerable to sweat & water.2) Also, This is the second retail unit which i got after replacement & the length of the two sides are not equal. There is a slight difference between the 2 sides.3) The buttons are tactile however the volume lower button is not tactile at all. You can't feel you are pressing the button. Might be an issue with the product. It might be a defective product (manufacturing defect)4) The magnetic bond between the two headsets is very weak. It5) This is a serious quality concern & Boat as a brand should adhere to the quality of their products.Pros:Apart from the cons mentioned above, here are some of my observations which i liked about the product.1) The bass level is good - this is a bass heavy earphones. As most of us like it.2) The dynamic range is also good. Will get a bit of a surround sound effect.3) The passive noise cancellation is also good. Once you plug it in to your ear, you will not hear any sound from outside.2) Also the mic quality is good. The other person on the other side will hear your voice - crystal clear. CVC Noise cancellation technology has been used - software based.3) The call quality is nice. You will hear the sound crystal clear. No drops in connection.4) Battery life is extraordinary - after a day's normal use - 10% battery got drained out.5) This is flat wire - hence doesn't get tangled.Conclusion - overall its a nice product, keeping aside the build quality/manufacturing defects."
Poor bluetooth range & receiver in not audible,2.0,"First time I ordered and received a product in which the bluetooth range was very poor & not audible to the receiver while attending calls. So I raised a request for replacement. The product which I received for the second time also had the same issues, so I retured the same. Very poor quality & unsatisfied with the product. However the delivery was ontime, packaging was good & service from Amazon was good."
Awesomeness as usual..! üå†üå†üå†üå†üå†üå†,5.0,"Ordered tis for the 2nd time as a gift.. Using one past 6months+ great sound quality, Bass treble noise cancellation, call quality.. Too good.. üëåHad Ordered a neon last time wich looked good, got a red one this time n it looks awesome, kinda shiny metallic red colour is what it is n man it looks ammazzinng...!!!!Worthy of its price..!"
Great Product with best Customer Support,5.0,"This product is very good. I say, best at available price. And moreover, the customer support is impressive. Had an issue with one side earphone not working after 7 months of usage. BoAt replaced me the product with a brand new one. This is what delights the Customer.Thank you for such a great service in such a competitive market.And with my verbal marketing, 8 of my office colleagues, family members bought this product and they too have a best experience with positive feedback.Thank you BoAt once again for the great product and service offered."
Dual Connectivity is of no use as it never performs perfectly ..,3.0,Sound Quality is Good not too high and Clear as well..Bass is not that much good and it does not have any Bass Booster mode... Overall Sound and Bass combination is good.Range is also good u can get a clear uninterrupted sound even if u are 2 or 3 room apart from your device.But here comes the main issue THE DUAL CONNECTIVITY its just bogus... In practical it is almost impossible to use this facility because when you connect the Laptop and phone simultaneously Prob 1. There is no auto play/pause system when u switch media play from mobile to laptop or vice versa2. When your mobile is connected and you are playing audio from laptop its actualy breaking and this problem is persistant until you disconnect your mobileSo Dual connectivity of this earphone is just Bogus and very disappointing ...My 3 star rating is only because of dual connectivity issue...
Got Duplicate product fail to claim even after having all billing details,1.0,"I planned to buy earphones for gifting to brother, it was stopped working in just 3 months , when go to service centre I come to know that I got a duplicate product, contact to Amazon help line & sent all billing details, but they were not responding, not even call  , very much disappointed,how to believe in reliability on Amazon's product & after sell service.Very much disappointed I decided to never ever buy from Amazon"
Warranty not honored,1.0,Company does not honor warranty and the product is no good- 1 year reviewThe product is so so in quality. One of the ear peices stopped functioning in a year. Still company refused to honor warranty despite due information sent to them. Overall utterly disappointing.
Good Quality - worth the price,5.0,"I am an old school type and does not really gets comfortable with the gadgets and accessories. My role at my workplace demands approximately 50% of my time on the phone calls. After giving so much consideration and thoughts about new mobile phones does not have the earphones jack support system, i had to buy one bluetooth earphones. BoAt Rockerz 255 Pro in-Ear Bluetooth Neckband Earphone, it turned out to be very comfortable and i am happy with the product quality. I have the freedom of not holding my phone all the time when i am on the calls, no entangling & detangling of my wired handsfree.  It is waterproof. It is light weight. Grips so well. The color is so... so... amazing that it absolutely adds up to the entire product.Worth Worth Worth Buying."
Replacement of product not working,1.0,"The product of Boat Rockerz 255  sports in ear did not work to my satisfaction and I tried to replace d product but no positive response was received from Amazon. Country went under lockdown and all services stopped for 4-5 months and the product could not be repaired, however as per Govt of India's Force Majeure clause all warranties should be extended accordingly. I once again request Amazon to repair d product or replace it"
Good,4.0,Its Almost 2 months since i am using this headset. Since last one week i am experiencig a small glich sort of problem with this one. Like if i am watching a video or movie it cancels itself and voice gets in normaly so i will have to reconnect it again. I am right now checking on the occurence again.Overall the product is good. Flexible and comfy to carry around. Charge stays through out the day.
"A great headset, worth its price",4.0,"I have been using this set everyday for the past 3 weeks and the battery life is impressive. It can last about 8hours of total usage, even spread out over a few days. Charging is incredibly fast.Sound quality is good, volume levels are adequate - you will rarely have to use the max volume, but the bass is slightly muted for those who want the 'boom'.Personally, 2 things bother me - it refuses to pair for calls with my Oppo Color OS though it allows me to pair for audio (Youtube etc). This could be an OS issue more than the headset though it seems to have the same issue with OnePlus as well. There is a welcome message and a goodbye message that loses its novelty very fast."
Awesome headphones,5.0,Simply amazing. The sound is just brilliant and if you can get it for 1000 bucks then even better. Beat is very punchy. The bass is held together very well. Mid tones and table are perfect as well. No issues with Bluetooth connectivity. Battery backup is great. I haven't used it at a stretch but I feel it should run for 6 - 7 hours on full charge. If you use it while jogging it does hold but not the most comfortable. They can fall off your ear while jogging.
Unreliable,1.0,"item stopped working within 15 days,  completely dead. charging also not showing anything, reading the other reviews its clear that there are many ppl who had faces this issue with the earphones it suddenly stops working and shows no signs."
Good sound with base. Nice feel,5.0,"Good sound with decent base. Infact it has simulated base on the right speaker. Nice rich feel. Wires strong. But what I don't like is that I have to press for 3 seconds to go to the next song. I don't know whether their missed call facility for registering for waranty is working. I emailed them a couple of times to confirm, but they have not even bothered to respond."
"Utilitarian. Not recommended for WFH, calls, etc",3.0,"Bought this in June 2020. The very first thing I noticed was a slight tinny quality of music, and slightly fuzzy audio. Another issue is an oversensitive mic. I bought it for WFH, but received repeated complaints of high background noise from the people in call. I had to relocate my entire setup to resolve this. To be specific, the TV in the next room could be heard clearer than what I was saying, even the dialogues. I also have a Boat BassHeads wired earphones, it didn't have these issues (it has an UNDERsensitive mic, but that is any day better)I was pretty disappointed, and got it replaced, but the issues persisted, leading me to believe this is what I can expect from these earphones. Recently, I also started experiencing a significant audio delay (~1-2 seconds) in both directions. This may be an issue with my particular piece as well.Other than these, the product is good. Its durable, easy to use, and the convenience of not getting bogged down by wires can never be understated. If you are okay with wired, go for wired. But if you are like me and need a pair of wireless earphones, keep the above issues in mind before ordering these."
"After 1 year and 2 months of use, Rough use.",5.0,"Pros,1. Charge - 2 hours for 8 hours backup, 1 hour for 4 hours and so on2. Charge complete - Blue blink without break, depleted - Red 7-10 blinks3. Takes time to connect? - Keep Switch on button pressed for 5-8 seconds right from switch on, don't stop pressing in between.4. Can connect 2 devices.5. Sound Quality - MEETING: 10/10, Gaming - 7/10, Music - 8/10.Cons:1. Band starts losing their touch and become jagged at earphone heads.2. Dual connection issue - Alternates sound from both, hard to manage.3. Buttons start to become less interactive with more pressure required to press them after 3-4 months.4. After 10 months - completely jagged pain to manage.5. After 1 year 1 month - One side(right side, depends on your use), no sound from earbud.Overall - 8/10Better performance than many competitors."
its value for money product,3.0,but I have observed there is delay and lag in connecting the devices and on-off suddenly it will disconnect from mobile and again connecting in 2 mins. this problem needs to be rectified and NOT a great experience with connecting two devices at a time feature.
Best Battery Backup Earphone,5.0,Boat earphone sound quality is always at good side but I am surprised by the battery back up of this 255 pro+ wirless earphone. Once it's fully recharged then it can easily goes till 7 days by using 7-8 hrs on daily basis. I have purchased green colour earphone a month back and so far I haven't found any issues. üëç
can be bought,3.0,"IT IS VALUE FOR MONEY. Its been a week since I have been using Boat Rockerz 255+ Pro.............& can say this1. Connectivity - The range is excellent. The connection, on the other hand, can be improved. Many a times I have faced difficulty connecting simultaneouly with both of my devices. Either it doesn't connect at a time with both or is disconnected automactically from one to connect with another.2. Battery - If I had to give points for battery out of 100, without a flinch I would give 200.3. Comfort - Not good if you have to wear for long period of time, or in your helmet. Its the only con I have come across which can change your decision to not buying these.In conclusion, it can be said that if you want a comfortable thing, this is not it but rest assured that everything else is up to the mark."
Awesome battery backup.,4.0,"Amazing battery backup. Lasts for days without charging. But can't be used for prolonged period of time due to uncomfortable fit. The buds are made of slightly harder material due to which ears starts to hurt after some time. Not recommended for continuous use. Otherwise great deal for 1k budget. Audio quality is average. Can't expect more for this price range. Bass is decent. Sound level is high. My device volume was mostly below 50% indoors and it was perfectly audible. At maximum volume distortion would be there due to the slightly lower audio quality. Overal, a decent product. I would have returned it if not of the battery backup. Coz it's highly uncomfortable and I typically use earphones for longer durations. But I can't because of this. I'm keeping this so that I won't need to worry about charging it. Calls are ok. Mic is also decent. Controls are also fine. Dual pairing works. Can play audio from one connected device at a time. If you are getting it, get some other silicon tips for better comfort. Otherwise best deal for this budget in my opinion, which is mainly focused on battery backup."
Go for it guys!!!! They are superb!!!!!!,5.0,"I love this earphones!! I had done a lot of research when i was buying and then i decided to buy this... Now it's been a  7days and i still have 20% battery... I'm a student so i use  it daily for my online classes for about 8 hrs and I'm really surprised by it's battery backup... Now let's talk about it's sound quality -- guys it's superb!!! I'm really impressed with ths sound quality, even at high volume u won't feel any distortion in sound quality , bass quality is boom! No words for bass ,it's awesomeüî•üí•üí•  I'm really happy and satisfied with the product and I'll definitely recommend it to you guys!!"
"Sound codec , Automatically turns on and off",2.0,Just ordered this product and when it got delivered within 2-3 days it disconnecting sometimes itself and then I requested replacement after that within the period of replacement delivery I saw that it has AAC codec which is a low codec than Aptx codec they have mentioned that it supports Aptx but it has AAC codec and sometimes it's latency gets high itself and it has a hiss sound in background you won't notice in daytime but you'll notice at night.
too great charging speed and better than rockerz 255,5.0,"this product is soo good, i have tried both the rockerz 255 and 255 pro, and 255 pro is too good. it charges so fast, that you cant imagine, i was listening to my lecture, when it told me, ""battery low"" i put it on charging while using it, my lecture, finished in like 30 to 45 minutes, when it got over, i checked its battery, it was full, even when i was using, it got charged to the fullest so fast, and i pretty much use it a lot so the battery life is rather above satisfactory"
Cheap move by boat,4.0,Boat has played very cheap this time. It is printed that aptx is supported by headphones but in reality it does not. So boat has stick a new sticker on the box to hide the aptx printed. This is very cheap stunt by boat.
Not impressive or suitable for Apple devices,1.0,"The product is decent, however certain flaws.1. This item is not a right fit for apple devices. Whenever there is a volume increase or decrease in apple mac or iPhone or ipad, it gives buzz sound.2. It often disconnects from the devices and reconnect.3.it often started giving welcome note without even i am disconnecting the device.4. Does not connect to 2 devices at a time.5. Very long cable in the front and often goes down to your tummy if you are moderate person in size.If you are good to invest couple more bucks, you can get either realme or mulo bluetooth earphones which are better than this."
The detailed and useful...,4.0,"You know its only good for music not for games and anyone who want to buy first check the size of your ear because mine was unstable and was falling down again and again ... In fact , I returned my earphone and instead bought boAt Rokerz 400 headphones that is better as, for music is amazing and wireless and in gaming foot sounds and so on are amazing and you can either choose wireless or wired (cable given with headphones)that is why it's make more adorable... I prefer choose wired headphones or earphones for gaming..."
Not as per my expectations,2.0,Pros:1. Battery life is amazing.2. Turbocharging and super fast.3. Bluetooth connectivity is good. Pairing is fast.Cons:1. Sound quality is mediocre.2. Bass is too loud and thumping. It irritates sometimes.3. Design flaws. Appearance when you wear it. Not stylish.
Nice one,4.0,"Received today, Ordered yesterday Night, I am using first time bluetooth earphone, i not a fan of heavy bass and i am also not music centric person, i only buy these because of calls, and calls are good i don't know about outdoor conditions like traffic etc. bettry backup is good, out of the box 100% i used these almost 3hours still it is 100%.sound is similar to boat 255, little better than 255, my friend is 255 not too mucb difference.According to my usage i think it is good, i am giving it 4 star because i don't like heavy bass. i like balanced sound."
Purchased 5 Pieces and all works GREAT,5.0,BoAt Rockerz 255 Sports is my first ever wireless bluetooth earphone ever. First I bought one for my use and after listening to it my colleagues started purchasing and even I bought it again and again to gift it to some of my friends and family members. All are working fine and absolutely mid blowing sounds. Loving every bit of it.The best out there for sure.
Buy Under ‚Çπ1300 anytime. ü§ôü§ò SOUND IS LIT!,4.0,"Everything is perfect in this earphone, but giving 4 star just because of the earphone wires are too long and they irritates. And when i use a single earphone it irritates a lot.Well coming to the weight and sound quality and earphone fitting!- Sound Is amazing full of bass, and fine quality of tereble. (I personally enjoyed listing songs it this).- Weight is negligible, i dont feel that there i something on my neck. Perfect.- Once i put the earphone inside they neither fell or nor they pains, even if i use them for 5-6 hra.- Battery is pretty impressive i used it for 5 hrs and still the battery was there. And its supports fast charging which really impressed me a lot.Overall its a nice earphone but there can be some more features like auto play/pause thorugh magnets.Low latency mode. So that one can play games and do editing too."
Disappointed,1.0,"Damaged Product and Packaging.Though this item was packed in another bigger carton box with air bubble cushioning and few other items, this particular item was damaged and the deal was open already.Thought, at least the product should do well, but the product failed to take charge and power up, which clearly indicated the product was a formerly returned item due to malfunction. Rather going to manufacturer warranty and repair/retirement this got resold.I've had many ear phones from BoAt and really love this brand (in the wireless category) alternating to House of Marley (in the wired category). But this one was shear disappointment."
Good product by Boat!,4.0,"Nice product at INR 999. Noise cancellation is really good. Great bass. The only thing is, once you've it connected, if you change the volume using buttons on the earphones or via mobile, it pops a sound every time. It becomes annoying then. For phone calls and video calls, the other person can hear you properly. The quality of sound is not at all compromised on call. If you are going to be on a call for long time, I'd suggest to keep the volume low. At higher volume I got a headache after a while. Do go for it for daily use like listening to music/podcasts or frequent calls.Edit: Been using this for a year now (August 2020- August 2021). No major issues. Only it has begun glitching the sound once in a while. I have been using this earphones daily for atleast 4-5 hours for last whole year. No problems at all. Worth the price!!! Buy it already!"
Poor pair of headphones,1.0,"Big cons for a wireless headphones in 2021:1. Magnets barely hold, and don't pause when connected. Music/audio continues to play and doesnt stay in sync with the phone/device.2. Material used is quite annoying and just too long and dangles too long around the neck.3. Cant pair multiple devices at once, and smart switching doesnt happen."
I blindly recommend to new buyers,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†This is my first neckband and first boat product. It is really good the sound quality and Bluetooth range everything is good at this price. The power backup is good, it's 3 days after delivery still I haven't charged it. Having 50+ percentage of charge. I using this for 9 to 6 Work from home and watching movies. I am using 8 to 12 hours a day. This is the best product at this price range. The one star reduced because of the length of wire it's little bit longer and the neck support is not that table. When you lie one side it sometimes falls down and the type C cable they provided that won't suit any Type C port. I tried with my phone and laptop also but it's so tight won't gets in. I also asked other people having this boat rockers 255 pro+ they are also having the same issues. The ear support that I removed it created some irritation. Other wise the sound quality, bass quality are at the best and mic is also pretty well and ear buds suits well. It's doing more than the worth of ‚Çπ1500"
Waste,1.0,"It worked only for 5 months.. Then it stopped working.. As they claimed the product is having 1 year warranty, I spoke to BOAT costumer care and sent it to service... They took almost 20 days to get me the product back.. But it's ok... I understand as there is lockdown.... But surprisingly... After getting back also.. IT DIDN'T WORK...... Since then I am trying to contact them.. But it's not connecting"
Not so good,1.0,"Honestly i dont like this earphone coz it is not comfortable in ear and slips.. when you tightly grip your ear feel pain after few minuts... I have make refund order but as per this product no refund provided. Only you get replaced same earphone... Oneplus earphone is better than this in comparison to bass, sound and comfort."
"Very worst after sales service, product is good buy if product got faulty then u have to throwaway",1.0,"Plz dont buy Boat products, as it has very worst after sales service, no customer care support, u can't message them, u can't mail them, mail will bounce back, customer's care nmbr is always busy, u can't connect to them.And at last u will feel helpless as I feel.I have been waiting for 2 months but there is no response form there side. Nobody cares about you once u purchased their product, there is no after sales department to support customers. Only the thing u can do is u can just raise a TT and send the faulty product to them, and you need to wait for years to hear from boat.TT: 1255029"
Stopped working just after a month's use,2.0,"I bought 2 pairs of these for my office work. These do not connect with MAC!Also, 1 pair stopped working just after a month & when I tried to register the complaint on their portal, its showing me that the service centre is closed due to pandemic. There is no other alternative suggested. I just wasted my money on these. DO NOT BUY THESE!! Wastage of money"
No connectivity,3.0,"For me, comfort matters the most. And rock boat-rockers has no comforting after wearing them my ear starts hurting, I thought it new that's why they are hurting so decided to write a review after a month and after a month it still hurts me in the ear and I cant be able to wear this at least for a minute. They are no doubt very uncomfortable. talking about the music it's average it was my first product from the boat and probably the last one, they didn't maintain the dignity of their product and paying 1500 for this product is like spending your money on waste.And the connectivity is worst it didn't connect to my laptop for 1/2 an hour in starting I'm a student and I bought them for my classes and they take 20 mins every day for getting connected it's a waste of money I must say...otherwise its your choice.."
Excellent call quality - mic is good. Simultaneous pairing to laptop is good.,5.0,"I returned a true wireless bud from a different brand, because hte mic was not sensitive. Got this due to past experience with the brand and this type of earphones. This is really effortless to use on calls. I purely use this for calling, and I don't have to bring the mic closer to my mouth to talk...i can talk naturally with both my hands free, and the other side can hear me clearly. This is the only thing that matters to me, though music too sounds awesome. Even the bass is good, nothing to complain. Pairing is good too, with simultaneous devices (phone + laptop is all i tried, and it works fine most of the times i.e. it will give computer audio, but when a call comes, it receives that too seamlessly). Sometimes though, you will have to repair it, like other bluetooth sets, while using 2 devices simultaneously."
Okay product,3.0,"So, Here's me After using this headset for around 8 months now.Pros:1. It has a great bass,2. Good noise cancellation3. Quite better sound clarity and4. Decent battery for 4-5 hrs when used cont.Cons :1. Stopped working from one side in less than 10 months.2. Bluetooth range is okay, not best( Can be counted in pros on this price range)3. Probably there's no Pick up Warranty support for this model.4. In aesthetics, Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.Over al 3.3-3.5 Rating out if 5."
This is amazing üéß,5.0,I was very hopeful to buy this boAt neckband and the amazing part is this neckband didn‚Äôt disappoint me at all. This is a great partner for me not even in official hours for 70-80 calls per day but after that soulful music with best sounds quality.Playback time deserves a big thumbs up üëçüèªJust charge once and forgot for entire week ü•∞
"Good product, pathetic sales service and warranty issues.",3.0,"Product is good but service center is pathetic. After using headphones for 8 months one side of earphone stopped functioning. So we raised a complaint on boat website ( as that is the procedure to complaint and claim warranty ) on 18th sep we have raised complaint and today is 27th it is still pending. Calling up their customer care is a big task , first of all it is very difficult to get connected to their executive and if you are lucky u get to speak with them. But they will give false promises and pick up of your product doesn't happened either.A product is good only if AFTER SALES SERVICE IS GOOD, otherwise people won't purchase it again."
Battery backup is horrible!!!!,1.0,"Bought this earphones considering the good audio quality mentioned in reviews. People who bought it forgot to mention the horrible battery backup of this earphone.I got my first earphone, and battery used to go down to 80% after a 10 mins call... And after a 1 hour call.. It would just be 50%. I thought it was a particular unit issue, so got the earphones replaced.And the same problem started happening in the new piece as well..As of now dumping this earphone and get a new one from another brand."
writing review after 1 year and 10 months,4.0,"finally on 15 jan 2021(bought 21 march 2019) this stopped working that is one side not working so i am all fine with the product till the date every penny is worth and the sound quality is amazing the battery life is till good , you can expect the life span to be of 2 years and not more betn they are the best in the market for 1500 price point"

Useless overrated headphones,1.0,"So here we go again. You move away from boat cause you have used it and it hardly works for more than 3 months.One of your supposedly tech expert friend buys a new boat headset and goes crazy making you think if the new product is really as good as he says.You read reviews (should be paid as most of them are positive) and start going over the technicalities.Amazon has a sale slashing the prize by 500.You go ahead and buy one.Boom!! Three months and one side of headset goes either blank or too low to hear anythingYou try for a replacement but they point you to a shop on the corner of the city (Imagine my plight as I stay in Bangalore)You throw this useless headphones away and go back to your old Sony headphones which look so outdated now but seems to work just as perfectly as it did since the day you bought. Oh, it's couple of years old as well."
Waste of Money I wouldn't recommend.,1.0,Second bad experience with boat earphones. Its been a month and found so many issues. Mic is not responding properly. Have to speak louder everytime so that the other person can hear me properly. Toggle on both devices are very difficult. Donot go for boat devices i would suggest its total waste. Noise cancellation is 0.
"Good sound quality, best battery, worst design earpieces to stay inside ears.",2.0,"Good sound quality and best battery playback time in this price. One of the worst design I've ever tried. The wire is too short from neck collar to the earpieces and worst choice to join the cable to the earpieces. Its at the end of the earpieces enough far from the ear plug to pull out the earpiece from ears again and again like some sort of lever by pulling then downwards, and these wings kind of things are not supportive enough to make them stay in your ears. If the cables were attached near the earplugs instead of the outermost end it would be much better and if the ""boat"" have provided some kind of hangers which could have like hanged the earpieces to the ears instead of these wings it would be best then."
Excellent quality overall,5.0,"I m using since mid March 2020. Getting appx 8 hr battery life for continuous usage of like listening to song, video, etc. One full charge a day is sufficient for the entire day. Best part is the bluetooth strength is for 20ft distance without wall in between. Device remain connected while I go to another room leaving the mobile in a separate room. I got it at 1399/-."
DUE TO HIGH BASS.. IT MISSES OUT TREBLE. Sound quality not up to the mark.,3.0,1. Sound quality is not good if you like slow Romantic songs or you're Neelesh misra story listener then this is not the right choice for you... Because due to high bass.. sometimes it misses out treble.. which is a big No no.2. Person on another side gets very compressed sound while talking on the call.3. Gives you 6-7 hour battery back up on full charge. Gets charge quickly. Battery gets drain too quickly after 30%
best if u purchased of 899 . amazing product,4.0,"best in this price , bass is good but beats are nI'll get straight to the pros and cons of Boat Rockerz 255 Pro Bluetooth earphones.PROS:1. Sound- compared to the non-pro version, it seems to me that there's slight improvement in quality. Not that it is very noticeable, but a slight improvement.Bass- has got good quality and quantity of bass compared to others in the same price range. The bass is clean, tight and is not muddy like realme bluetooth earphones.Vocals- the vocals are clear and crisp.Loudness- it is loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment.2. Comfort- the earphones are comfortable to wear but without the ear guides. Maybe that's just me, but wearing along with the ear guides gave me pain in the ears which eased off once the ear guides were removed.3. Design- it is of neckband design that is comfortable to wear. The buds have got magnets in it which helps it stick to one another when hanged down so that no tangling occurs.4. Colour- comes in some trendy colours like yellow, teal green, blue and red. The youngsters would love this just for that.5. Fast charging- gets completely charged in just an hour and has got high voltage protection too.6. Sound isolation- nothing to brag about but comparable with others in the same price segment.7.Mic- the calls were very clear. The person at the other end told me that the voice was audible without any disturbances and indeed very clear.8. Connectivity- this has got the A2DP feature. So dual connectivity is present and I did not experience any connection drops of any kind.9. No Lag- there was no lag experienced while playing PUBG.CONS:1. Battery- this is the biggest gripe anyone could have with this earphone. The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers. Though there's fast charging one would expect headphones in this price range to last at least 10 to 12 hours but not Rockers PRO lasts for almost 6 to 8 hours. That's what I got out of them and that was not enough.2. Price- the asking price of 1599rs is high. You may get it for 1200rs during offers. Even then it is not value for money because of the poor battery backup.3. No auto on-off with magnetic buds- the feature which is present in Realme bluetooth earphones. This feature could have improved the battery life of this pair very much but alas it doesn't have it.Final words:Boat Rockerz 255 Pro bluetooth earphones are good in terms of sound quality and trendiness but lack in terms of battery backup. Though there are several pros than cons it all comes down to the battery life and this one loses out on that badly.Other options in the same price range - LoodAudio Everloop (good @1169rs), Boat rockerz 255( when in offer @ 999rs), Blaupunkt BE50(999rs during offer or even @ 1399rs), Sony WI-200( pricey @1699rs and high in treble), Realme bluetooth earphonest clear comparetively to jbl or sony ."

Defective product. Don't trust on this retailer,1.0,This is worst product fullfilled by Amazon. I got defective item or all the items are same. Noise cancellation not at all working. Battery drains from 60% to 20% in just 30 to 40 minutes. After that every minute it irritate battery low audio message. Earbuds are very hard.From last three days i am waiting for pick up.  Worst experience from Amazon.  Don't buy anything on Amazon Prime days.  If they can't provide delivery on time in normal days then how can they do in peek time.
Donot buy as there no after service,1.0,"I would like to say , the quality is good cor the price but one side stops working after 1 or 2 months.Thats not an issue because its under warranty.BUT heres why u should NOT buy this product.No service at all. You try calling the service center and you just dont connect.I registered a complaint 15 days back and literally no response.I have 8 products of boat because i thought its value for money but with no after service whats the point."
Good product,4.0,"It's good product. It's bass is good. Sound quality is also good. But it's earbuds is not good. It's earbuds is totally worst. After wearing more than 3 or 4 hours you can feel some pain due to earbuds. Battery backup is excellent, I think no other products compare with its battery backup, After full charge you can use it atleast 7 days definitely on regularly use upto 7-8 hours per day."
Call Quality!!!!!!,4.0,"Purchase for mostly calls, its decent, noise cancellation is badhiya, BASS QUALITY is THIKTHAK, vokals is everge, not up to the mark, battery is exlant, 3/4 days no tension for changing, BUILD QUALITY is ok, not for hardcore music lovers, gamers, but overall good package in dis price rangeüëå!!!!!!!!"
Best in battery backup but with few demerits,4.0,"I have used the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z earlier which was very good inbuilt quality and sound. The battery-saving option using the magnets in the OnePlus model was its USP which is not present in this one. The Bluetooth remains active and connected all the time which drains the battery but on the contrary, the battery life is quite high as claimed by the Boat, and gives you that extra time gap to recharge it again. All in all the earphone is good in bass and sound quality and since it has a huge battery life, therefore, the battery-saving function can be compromised. Price is also competitive."
Low battery. Horrible service for return,1.0,It worked well for the first 2 months. But the battery is a huge problem from the beginning. Hardly works for 6 hours. You have to daily charge it. After 2 months the sound quality suddenly dropped to just 10% of the original. I requested a return since it was in the warranty period of boat but my product got merely picked up and since 10 days I have been trying to contact them to know the status but to no avail. Looks like they have disappeared now at the name of return. Horrible service from boat
Better not Best,4.0,"1. design is good or say just okay.2. Plastic body.3. Battery backup is great.4. Bass is too much, should be little lower.5. Connectivity is okay with iPhone mostly connect automatically on power on.5. Call quality : okay not good bt in price which is Amazon offering it is good. Where no noise, call quality is good. Out side, too much wind sound reach to other. Still to check in crowded area perhaps not build for.6. Bluetooth range is good.Conclusion: below 2000/- anyone should not expect good call quality. Rest is good. U can choose this wireless earphone 255 plus pro without hesitation."
Satisfactory performance after month too.,3.0,"First time bought this wireless earphones. Therefore can't say much . But yes, it is a satisfactory experience. Play time is good. In single charge you can complete your one day easily if you are not a heat user. For ther users who continue operat with this gadget will disappointed with battery back up. Connectivity is super fine. Once pairing done it again connect in no time.Give range upto 5 meters only or voice will interrupt. Call quality is super fine on both side."
its not as great as it advertised,1.0,the sound quality is avg compared to oneplus earphones of same price its like cup of water in front of an ocean(one plus).it does not auto connect mostly.auto disconnect and reconnects.the magnets connecting the earphones are soo pow quality that a simple shake of walking can make the buds wander around( not connecting with magnet).its a little but bulky . the ear gaurds along with the earphones are a little bit rough at some times it hurts also.one plus point is its battery it is huge .last mostly 4-5 days of single charge and regular usage.not recommend for workout people .one problm i found is that when i try to change the song using the controls in head set it automatically dial up my last called number its so awkward to say sorry i wrongly called u .to multiple people due to this issue.
Good pair of bluetooth headphones,4.0,"I bought this bluetooth after reading many reviews onlinepros:1. O mahn the bass is really good being a bluetooth device2. in ear fit is good3. battery life is decent, I never used it continuously for more than 1 hr or so4. you can pair it with your PC & mobile at the same time, basically you can pair it with two devices at the same timecons:1. the wire seems a bit odd then you wear it, its just too long according to my liking, I mean it should be similar to **Boult Audio ProBass Curve Neckband in-Ear Wireless Earphones**2. ear piece is a bit bigger in size3."

Boat 255 not worth a penny,4.0,"I have bought this headphone an year back and it was really outstanding. Based on the I ordered boat 255 and it was not upto the mark. When I connect it to any laptop, the laptop restarts sometimes without notice. When i connect to Samsung phone ...the bluetooth disconnects and reconnects.. boat 255 - not worth a penny ..."
Overall a mediocre product,3.0,I have been using this product for over a month and i come to an conclusion i could have bought another better wireless earphone Sound quality is good specially BASS is good but it does lack range.It has only range of 4-5 metersand MIC does not offer much while calling i have receive complaint that other person cant hear me properly unless you are stationery at any given place battery goes off unexpectedly from 55% to 10% at any time but battery can withstood up to  8 hours i should have chose for another option. I recommend you to buy another product or if you get this product under 1000 then you can this instead.
Very good product,4.0,"Sound effect is very good, clarity of voice is very good , worth buying .This is immediate feedback within 2 days... ( Since  i am using BOAT SPEAKER... that's why i am giving immediate feedback)Only Improvement needed in finishing of volume and power button, headset cable seems bit flimsy we need to see the robustness of wire,"
May be a duplicate product delivered,1.0,Not as expectedI think i have received a duplicate product.My friend have the same with excellent music experience thats why i have purchased but bass is too low compared to him.May be a duplicte product is received.So it is not recommended to purchase from amazonReview after using one month and comparing with same product of a friend
Good product less cost compared to other brand,3.0,Good product less cost compared to other brandPros1.less cost2. Long lasting battery3. Water and sweat resistCons1. Normal sound quality2. Quality of wire should be improved
Best but only for single year usage.,5.0,"I am a bit too crazy about my earphones to sound systems so I need best and in good budgets too and I bout this on sale it cost me only 1k so bought 2 of them. 1- of them is not working now but another one is still in use but battery backup is not giving much backup now it has been a year. I'm having fun because it has given me the best experience of sounds, bass and battery backup till the time. It's worth buying and best for heavy sweats and medium ran too. I took my earphones on 1-3 points of volume and it gives me backup of 10 to 12 hours at the volumes. I say its the best in this price."
Best bt headphone under 1500,5.0,"I used this headphone since 15th october ... today is 6th november ..build quality is great .. Styling is also great..I am getting 6-8 hours of battery backup with standby for 4 to 5 days... awasm battery backup..Coming  to sound quality,,, the punch of bass is just solid,, the midrange is also great,, high is little bit low,, but ok,, overall very very good sound quality... i was not accepting this type of sound quality ....also sound output is very loud...if u have a budget of 1.5k... just go for it.... u will be happy for sure.. and in this budget point,, there are no headphone that will compete this BOAT...A QUALITY PRODUCT FROM A QUALITY BRAND....."
"Good deal, recommended.",4.0,"Good 1 @ Rs.910. I bought it during sell.Sound clearity is awsome.Bass quality is awsome. Fits ears well.Bluetooth connectivity is good upto 10 feet distancePerfectly balances low & high frequency below ~85‚ÑÖ sound intensityAt higher sound level, high frequency bits are noisy & disgusting. But you can eliminate this issue if you adjust equilizers.Satisfied purchase"
Worst product and worst service regarding replacement,1.0,"Am just using this product from Aug 2020. Recently in this month (April 2021) the battery got expanded and the chare also drains within 2-3 hrs. so I just applied for a warranty replacement on 15th April, also they picked up the next day 16th April. and the shipment also shows it was delivered at the other end on 20th April. Due to Covid-19, they've been mentioning commonly in their website as, 'there will be a delay'. so i just waited for 9 days till now. its being frustrating that, still i didn't got any notification on this. so i trying to contact their team via their mail and their customer service number, i can't even talk to them. no one is picking the call and also no reply for my mail. WORST SERVICE & WORST PRODUCT!!!!. i decided not to buy any product from Boat anymore."
Product box damge Already someone used this product.,1.0,Boat is good company and sound quality is best in this range. I used already 2-3items of boat. Amazon shipping is also good but this time i recived a used product so i replace my order . Now lets see what happened.
Too much Bass,5.0,"The product itself is all that was mentioned in the title, everything was exactly as I was told. It's amazing!The only thing is, due to the extra bass, other sounds are a little bit underwhelmed.The noise cancellation is awesome, the first few days it was noticeable. I wouldn't say by how much it reduced the noise, but if I had to say at the very least - half - but over time, maybe I got used to it or something, but I didn't pay much attention to the noise cancellation anymore. I believe it still works because it's passive cancellation.Another thing, the earpiece (i.e. the curved rubber part that is there to support the earbud from not falling off) starts to hurt over time (for my ears at least), and if you remove them, they fall off due to the weight. So I can only use them for an hour or two (which is alright, I mean, I'm not supposed to use them for that long anyway).So, overall, again - great product!"
Battery life üëç,3.0,"Bought it because of battery life. For music I have separate pair of earphones(wired). This one is only for Teams and phone calls during work hours.Sound - average or below average (don't expect much in this price) sound covers all bass, balance, high, lows and all other thing you know.Battery life - as advertised."
Good deal for the price offered,4.0,For the price it is offered I would recommend this . Noise cancellation is surprisingly good . Sound quality is also impressive but not the greatest for sure . Bass effect is more . Fit the ear perfectly and doesn't come off . Wire and exteriors are made of plastic but serves the primary purpose . Bluetooth slightly deteriorates when you keep the phone and move to another room with too many walls obstructing . But overall is a good deal . Battery lasts upto 6 hours .
"Great Sound quality, great noise cancellation, great battery, below average 2 device connectivity!",5.0,"Most honest Review after 1 month use!  First, sound quality and noise cancellation is best in class! Way way better in comparison to Boult earphones. Fitting in ear is awesome too! And battery lasts at least 2 days on full charge! The only issue is that it doesn't always connect to two devices as claimed! My Boult earphones didn't have that issue! They connected two devices perfectly! This one doesn't, even tho claims to! For the rest, it's best in class! If you're looking for earphones, these are the best! Might not look the coolest but the performance holds it on top of its competitors!"
Good earphone,5.0,"I love the earphone. I worked a 6-hour shift and played music nonstop. The volume is loud and clear, so I had it turned way down. The noise-canceling is good. They are very comfortable and do not fall out. You can tuck the neckband in your shirt and only see the earplugs. I recommend these."
Multifunctional button doesn't work properly. And some time the sound is fading away.,1.0,"Hopeless... The multifunctional button doesn't work properly to open google assistant where my weried headfone of 400 can do it easily. May be it is only happend with my item...and i think they send me a used item.. Now I decide to order it from boat official app or website, where don't have any dissatisfaction. I got some discount about 200 that's why I ordered it but got only disappointment. Also delayed in delivery."
They're Actually Good,4.0,"They're best at this price point , before buying them i did my research and i was right , it's amazing , the only thing i didn't like is the right side piece fall out of my ear alot whenever i try to use the control buttons , maybe my ear is built different , but from sound perspective , they're really great , bass is also really good , clarity was on point as well .The best selling point for them is the battery , no other product is offering 40hrs battery."
Fantabulous investment!,5.0,"Pros: excellent sound production even though it's bluetooth; I've stopped using panasonic wired earphones because this product produces better sounds. The mic is positioned perfectly and the other person can hear well. Bass is very good indeed, I connected it to TV and the movie sounds were mind blowing, felt like a movie theater. Battery back up is really impressive and lasts a whole day for me, it depends on how you use it though. Charging time is another pro because it gets fully charged in an hour even when connected to laptop. The chance of losing these are minimal thanks to magnets on both earphones which attach themselves when not in use.Cons: the band gives me allergy because of constant rubbing with the back part of my neck (this is just my issue as I suffer from skin related allergies). The lights on the earphone are too dim. The bands on the earphone which give it a unique style are hurtful, so I removed them totally and also changed the ear buds to red (used panasonic buds) . If you are a fast walker like me and when not in use, the earphone will swing like a pendulum, so I put it in my front pocket or shirt (this is not a con really).Conclusion: absolutely great earphones and bluetooth is perfect üëå don't waste your time looking for other options unless you have high expectations with bass and other features."
Awasom as on delivery date 05/05/21.,4.0,"Not a Good product.On 24/06/21 it stop working. Could not able to connect with any bluetooth devices. Though this device is within warranty period unable to contact service provider in this lockdown period.Well, I change my review. The service provider pickup the errotic product from home & service it & supplies at home. It is running fine. I am happy with it.  Thanks boat for prompt action."
Best Earphone,4.0,"Best Earphone,Thanks to Amazon Seller and Delivery Agent.Advantages:1.The build quality and color is fantastic(4/5),2.The quality of the sound is crystal clear(4/5),3.The (Bass)(4/5)on this headphone is very nice,4.This is a great headphone for playing games.....Drawback:1.Sometimes the connectivity issue occurs  2........Nothing......."
Lifespan of earphones less than 8 months,2.0,"After using this product for eight months, it's right ear is not working,While playing online games, my friends hear some tic tic sound coming from my mic,It's loosing it's bluetooth connectivity from any device,It's taking longer time to wake and sleep the device.Don't use it for more than an hour as it will damage your eardrums, mine have been damagedConclusion sound quality,notice cancellation, but poor long term build quality.Lifespan less than 8 months"
Good sound quality and un believable battery life.,5.0,Writing this review after 7 days of extensive use of headphones. I bought this on 22nd Aug 21 and was fully charged. I've used it on daily basis with my laptop and phone for calls and meetings as well as listening music for 7 days now and it still showing 40% battery is remaining while writing this review. It has good sound quality and extraordinary battery life. Go for it. üíØ value for money.
Don't go for it.,1.0,"Don't go for it, I think this one is failure a model, first time I purchased Rockers 255 pro,after using of 5 days there was an mic issue due to that I replaced through Amazon, after receiving the replacement product after using of 20days again mic issue as well connection issue also, now the replacement window also closed by Amazon, so what I have to do? I don't know? So please don't go for this model it is full of money waste product."
Stopped working in 12 days @#‚Çπ_&--+()))//,1.0,"This is disgusting. The product stopped working in exactly 12 days. Bought on 7 Mar 2019 and the return deadline was a 10-day window. This is utter nonsense. Don't know how to return this damn crap now. I'll need to file a suit rather, for the benefit of greater good.Current update as on 26 April: I got the replacement product directly from Boats company and Amazon played no role or assisted in anyway."
Nothing extraordinary :/,2.0,I had purchased after seeing so many positive reviews but there is nothing extraordinary.  Battery drains after 60% like one minute it is 60% and it goes off after max 2-3 minutes. It does not auto connect even after paring. Have to manually connect every time. Also the sound quality is not at par with JBL.  Now that I have put in 1500/- have no option but to continue as long as it works.. which does not seem very far along.
Overall not recommended,2.0,"Attracted by low price from a authentic company whose most products are upto the mark and meet standards but this earphone lack so many things1. Cheap looks2. Poor material3. Battery shows only three options 100%-80%-60% üòÇüòÇüòÇ only company knows the meaning4. Wire is too long and gets tangled5. Sound quality is good according to price6. No return option, only same product can be replaced by AmazonOverall not recommended product"
Boat never disappoints,5.0,"Instead of taking usual 3.5mm jack earphone.. I really recommend this..Not much of difference with cost..Battery is pretty good..You even get battery level in your phone (iOS to be specific, not sure of andriod). Not much accurate thoughOnly issue is with that tail around ear buds.. When you keep earphone in bag it can fall off easily.."
Best Budget Friendly Wireless Bluetooth Earphone,4.0,"If you are looking for a pocket friendly bluetooth wirelss earphone with a decent sound quality, this product from Boat could be a good choice for you. I purchased it @ INR 999 during the great amazon sale (usually available @ INR 1499). I am writing this review after using the product for 6 months.First let us talk about the features that the company highlights with my comment on it:-- Super Extra Bass - I would not completely agree with this claim although I would say that it has a good bass (Plus I personally do not prefer too much of bass)-- Water and Sweat Resistance - It is definitely sweat resistant and I can claim that as I use it while working. The sound quality is not disturbed with sweat; but not very sure with its water resistant claim. I have been out in light drizzle with this ON; the sound quality did not get affected in the first 10 min, but then it got a little bad. I would not advise to try any stunt with this pocket friendly earphone ;)-- Sound Quality - I would rate it above average. Cannot expect anything better in this range.Now, I would want to mention a few more pointers that I look at in an earphone:-- Noise Cancellation - Not that great with noise cancellation. There are 2 aspects to it. One, the unwanted noise is not passed through the mike. Second, while you are using it, you are not hearing others around you. It provides partial noise cancellation in the second scenario-- How it fits in the ear - Could have been better ergonomically designed. The each support may come out at times and this is the only part where I thought Boat could have done better even at this budget.-- Buttons - Honestly, I do not use it to receive or end phone calls too often, but it works fine to receive calls and adjust the volume. The buttons are on the right side and very conveniently placed.-- How it feels to use it- The product is to be worn around your neck and is very comfortable. although the wire length from the shoulder to the ears is a little long and could have been shorter.I am using this earphone regularly for the past 6 months and have bought one more to gift my sister too. If you have a limited budget, like I did, you can go ahead with this. It is surely one of the better products available in this price range."
Avoid even if below ‚Çπ500,2.0,"Very bad sound quality. Old system of having controls on the wire instead of the stick. Bought it cause it had same day delivery, and my previous headset had broken. Btw, it was a ‚Çπ600 product, whereas this is double the price. Unfortunately, it has replacement warranty only."
Dissatisfactory quality,1.0,The audio quality is good but can not produce audio more than 15k decibels. I connected it to my mac and worked great for 2-3 minutes and then there wall null audip output from the laptop but was Receiving connected or disconnected AI audio. After a power off/on it was difficult to connect to Any device in pairing mode of course. After 3-4 power off/on worked fine but don't want to take any further risk so returned the product being much unsatisfied.
Quality of product and sound,3.0,"So, I'm happy with the sound quality, it is good. But, the battery life is average. Lasted 4-5 hours on full charge.. also the ears pain if you use for more than an hour.. I will recommend it, but I think the 335 would be a better option. Also, Amazon doesn't give you an option of changing the product to another one. You will get the exact same one if you do a return... So plz be mindful bfor placing ur order.The packaging wasn't in the best condition and I mean the box of the earphones.."
Average sound quality,3.0,"Average earphones for the price range,  the audio clarity is not upto the mark , i felt ptron tangent beat has much better sound clarity , i am not comparing the battery back up or charge time here, going by audio quality not worth, bass is good but treble is bad, build quality is good and solid,"
Good earphones,4.0,I have been using since 2 months.battery life is good for normal calls and standby.if we use continuously full volume battery will be 6 hrs.if we use below 60% volume battery life is 2 days for genral calls and standby mode.calls clarity is OK.there is no noise cancellation.
One of the best budget sports Bluetooth headphones.,4.0,"The headphones are good, however the first one broke within one month, and boat replaced it, so kudos. Battery life is enough for one and half of my gym sessions, so I'd say between 5-6 hrs. Sound is clear with good depth."
For music lovers but noise cancellation sucks.,4.0,"Sound quality is good and battery life is also good. The product is strudy and the buttons are responsive too. Charging time is also manageable. Bluetooth range is also good, i didn't feel any sort of disruption or delays when listening music.Noise cancellation of this product is below average."
Super Sound And Battery backup is awesome,5.0,"This boAt Rockerz 255 is Very Best Product to Buy Because in low Price They are giving High quality of bluetooth headset I Am Using Since 2 days I notice that The Buds Of This headset are hard they are paining in ear so I Changed That From other size Which Are giving Extra in box THERE ARE TWO SIZE AVAILABLE OF RUBBER BUDS,Battery Backup and Song base Is mind Blowing i love these Headset I buy this Product in ‚Çπ999 2 days Before from amazon now the price increase 500Rs But MY Rating TO THIS PRODUCT9.5/10:- in Battery Backup8.6/10:-in physical Body10/10:-in sound high base10/10:-buds style is awesomeColours: black is not goodNeon is GOODBUTRed is awezome red colour looks like gaming headset"
Received a replacement in 4 days... That was fast. They stopped functioning. But received it asap!!!,4.0,It was bought due to necessity as my speakerphones werent functioning properly albeit lockdown.Started troubling in a week.The earbuds or whatever u call them werent comfortable at first but then I gradually got used to them.. It maybe becuz i never used headphones before on a long term basis...Now under warranty . lets cUpdate:Replaced in 4 days... That was super quick! The headphones are nice but discharge a lil faster that others.  Still i like them.
Not charging bought just 7 days back,1.0,Dont buy this product. very cheap material also  had bad experience following up the customer service. I used it while jogging and in a week's time it is not charging. My return period has also expired yesterday 18th Feb 2019. I keep it for charging but the red light never glows and also not switching on. Regret buying this product for 2000. Advise not to buy this product very bad quality. Should have invested that 2000 in some other products. I have been a regular buyer in Amazon did not expect this type of product. Please allow me to return this product
Honest Review,4.0,Boat rockerz 255 proWell overall a good product from boat .ProsBattery backup is good.Sound is not so clear like jbl but ya good bass.Fast charge capable.ConsColour (for teal green ) looks  bit ugly and looks like a  used product so dont buy this colour .The colour of wire is skyblue but the wings and cabinet where there r buttons the colour is very bad seriously dude i thought it was a used product but later on observing other buyers photo i realised that it is manufactured colour.The Bluetooth connection takes a bit timeAnd sometimes it didn't even connect.Bought in sale for rs 1099 which i think was a good deal it is best in segment to rs 1400.thank youWill edit this after 6 month
Not so great,3.0,After 3 months usage :The product is not so good as it looks.Pros :Holds charge for long time.Connectivity is quick.Cons:Not comfortable fit.Sound distortion when used in calls.Not so great sound qualityOverall i regret spending 1.5 k for it.Update after 6 months - Charging port got damaged and product useless. 1600 rs gone in vain.
Requested For Return,3.0,"Hi All,I purchased this product, Everything seems to be fine except below things due to that i requested Amazon for return the same and they are1) At low volume of music you will continuous listen the humming sound (Means not music sound, Sounds which speaker generated by own) which is very discomfort for Ear and this is major issue, due to this i requested for return2) Cables length is quite long, Which not looks good when it hang till near to your stomach but above of that (5'6)3) To fit the noise cancel soft bud you have to enter speaker very deep in ear, so for long term in and out activity like this to  your ear probably can make ear hearing problem."
Manufacturing defect and after sale service issue,1.0,I bought two rockerzz 255. A good sound in this price and good backup......But after using 5-6  months both of them had same problem. One oh the ear piece stopped working. One was used by me in Delhi whereas other was used by family members. No wear n tear but still stopped and sometimes give sound for a second or two. It is not easy to get warranty complaint. Neither online nor on phone.Planning to visit service center. So device is good but seems there is some manufacturing defects and service is not also up to the mark which should be as it is growing company....if it continues then Boat will be also like Micromax
"It's a good product, but I do feel sometimes it sound automatically starts distorting",5.0,"It's a good product, but I do feel sometimes it sound automatically starts distorting. It does not happens always but once in a while the right earphone sound starts distorting after using the earphone like for 15-20 mins and that is bit irritating. I think it's a manufacturing defect. I was facing the issue with the earlier headphone too and I replaced it with Amazon. And now 2nd one is alsi giving same issue. But on other hand I have tried using Noise brand earphone and it plays well, it's sound doesn't distorts.... Don't know exactly what's the problem? Either it's earphone or my phone... M not sure! ... But the sound quality is excellent of Boat compare to Noise...."
Go for it,5.0,This is a very good product and very useful 1)Sound quality is very good 2) noise cancellation works very good 3) the two pair of extra ear plugs provided are also of very good quality 4) the rubber hook which is there to provide better stability helps while doing rigorous workout 5) quality of the flat cable and the buttons is very good one can buy it without having a second thought
"Good, but could be better!",3.0,"Overall good. Sound is clear, loud and not distorted. Noise cancellation is proper. In 999-1299 ‚Çπ price segment, I think its worth to give a go.Packaging of the original product box was pathetic, amazon shipped it in a plastic only, without any protection.. very bad I would say.Product price varies within ‚Çπ999-1499. Amazon is ridiculously varying it instantaneously. Despite repeated requests and communications, even though price decreased by ‚Çπ490 in a single day, I got no goodwill/compensatory cashback, which  Amazon used to provide before."
Confused wid Boats or JBL in 1500 to 2000 price range,5.0,"Hi All,I have purchased boats earphones after reading many reviews and asking to my friends who are using boats....from everywhere I got good feedback and when I personally felt good.Meanwhile I check JBL brand aswell costing 2000 aprx with the same specifications. JBL also good one but if u r looking MORE BASS then boats bit more than JBL in this price range.CONS: because of rubbered ear strips...u cannot hear outside sound...coming to JBL u can hear outside sound as well...u don't feel like ur ears are completely blocked with JBL earbuds.Concl:Both Boats and JBL are good... U have to choose based on your Priority and interest n comfort u feel with.."
Value for money,5.0,"I've purchased this one in Big Billion sale at 899/-. I just wanna say,within one thousand, this is the best one IF you want longer battery backup. Seriously boAt has given a monsters battery. One more thing,its IPX7 rating, you no need to worry about collar sweat, headfone will be in safe hands for its IPX7 rating. Truly recommended this headfone under 1k. But I didn‚Äôt get a new cover box from Amazon,an old box was received, don‚Äôt know why amazon has done this..."
value for money,4.0,"I am writing this review almost after 1 year. This product still going on happily , battery performance is still awesome and definitely going to recommend you this product.If 2 devices are connected at a time and if you disconnect any one then it will disconnect other device too, this problem am still facing."
Gr8 product,5.0,"This is a great product that is super easy to use. The controls sit on your neck, so I can use it when I am wearing a helmet, which is a big plus for me. It was easily paired with both my iPhone and my Samsung M31. The charge lasts a really long time. I highly recommend it."
Very good purchase for this price.,4.0,I am using it from last two months.(Rs. 999)Sound Quality_ Moderate (difficult to listen music in hevat traffic)Noice cancellation _ Not upto the markBluetooth connectivity _ ExcellentRange_ goodCharging time is less and has sufficient battery backup ( say 1 day)Conical buds causing pain innear so I removed them.Wires are quite long.Gud to play PugGü§™
headphones 1 side of it is not working.called for warranty on No 02249461882 but it's not working,1.0,After 3-4 months of rare use as like other local headphones one side of headphone is not working ...we called regarding warranty on No 02249461882 but it's is not connecting at all... really don't know if this headphones is made for sport's man's who can use it while doing extensive workouts...how the quality of such headphones like local...
No Warranty support from Boat,1.0,"Hi, After using this product for quite sometime now my product stops charging and hence i reached out to boat for the same. My product is still under warranty and i came to know that for this product which is sold on amazon. They do not have any customer care support nor any place to raise the ticket. They simply display the address to Hyderabad city and when you try to call to those number or reach that place no one is there to help you out with you  concern.I am writing this review with my 1st hand experience and i personally feel that there is no service for this particular product. So, Please purchase this product on your own and if it stops working better throw it instead of wasting any time.Thanks."
Great product,4.0,One of the best headsets in terms of quality.. however it doesn't stay in my ears for long..it falls off. Amazon should keep a return policy for them incase you are not comfortable using them you are stuck with it.. otherwise the quality of the headphones is awesome..clarity is good.. especially on calls you won't hear any additional noise..if you're planning to use it for longer duration choose the one tht'll stay in ur ears.
Sums up to be a good product at low price . Headphones that can be said to be value for money.,5.0,I am using this product from last 6 months and happy with its overall performance. Bluetooth connectivity is good connects faster to both Apple phones and android phones .Battery lasts for 5-7 hours depending upon how much calls and music you hear so at this price it‚Äôs a good product to go for . Noise clarity is good but it‚Äôs average for noise cancellation. Would recommend to go for it .
"Worth for money. Best battery with noise cancellation, with moderate sound quality.",5.0,"This is my 2nd blue-tooth, the sound quality is proportional to the money you pay. Battery back up is really good I used the old one more 10 months and the battery (7-8hrs) performance was still as good as a brand new headset. Now its been 2 months I am using this am happy with the performance. Must buy this product for GYM.Noise cancellation quality is also really good.Can connect 2 device at a time is the best thing. I so connect to my laptop as well as mobile phone this feature really saves time and handy usage."
Super satisfied customer. Hence bought 2 of em üòú,5.0,"Great battery standby is the 1st thing i would mention, 2nd would be awesome quality sound. Pretty loud when u need it and not overwhelming at the same time. Great bass and surround effects. This is my second purchase of boat rockerz 255 and am currently using both of em as i am on calls and music most of the time. Still it gives more than 8 hours standby.Great buy. Very much recommended. Also i have claimed warranty from boat and got a replacement so i can say the warranty claim they make works. GO FOR IT."
Waste of money,2.0,"This is the very worst product i ever bought, its get automatically disconnected while playing songs or speaking in calls. One side earphones are not working properly. If i used for calls the other person on phone keep complaining about my voice (like your voice not clear, your voice is not audible, your voice is very noise etc...). Not worthy for money, if you are use only for listening songs its suitable otherwise dont go for this. Waste of money....... I got a same complaint on the first one i ordered then i get a replacement but that too seems like the older one.."
A bit disappointed,3.0,"I have been using this nearly for a year now, a bit disappointed.The only thing that forced me to write a review is after sales service of boat, these guys managed to pick up my earphones during lockdown when I registered a complaint. I have till date claimed the warranty three times ( while I am writing this it is the third time my earphones are with Boat).The first time- there was a malfunctioning issue it used to turn off on its own sometimesThe second time- the time one of the sidrs stopped working, this was during lockdown it took a month for them to give me a replacementThe third time- the mic stopped working, it is currently with them.3 times there is an issue with the quality of the product you offer, although your after-sales service is good but it is of no use of I have to wait a month everytime they stop working."
BoAt Rockerz 255 pro+ || Awesome earphone from BoAt || Review By Arif,5.0,"BoAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ , I think it's a brilliant neckband/wireless earphone from BoAt in battery life..I received it on 30 may 10:45 Am (with 100% Charge) i using it from after 12:30 PM , and I reviewing it on 5 june, after using 6 days in normal way (6/7 hour daily), it says battery low on 5 june around 9/10Am , then i plugged in charging for 10 minutes , then it shows 60%, then i think it can provide upto 10 hour or 7/8 hour call/music playback in 10 minutes charge, and it takes 1 hour for full charge..Comment by features :* Look : Look is not a premium look, in comparison to others neckband. (335, 330 etc.)* Noise cancellation : Noise Cancellation is good but not excellent.* Sound Quality : Sound is good and bass is excellent with AAC codec, but my phone (Samsung Galaxy J7 ) doesn't support aptX codec then i can't tell anything about aptX codec..  I'm a bass lover üòç* Battery : battery is awesome , it's provide me 6 days after using it 6/7 hour daily (charge from manufacturer/marketing agency or packer)But you can assume as it can provide 36 to 38 hour battery backup..* Sticker : I puted the sticker on earphone left handle and it's improve the look of the earphone..And i suggesting to BoAt that print this as a plastic print on any handle of earphone..* Dual pairing : Dual pairing is good but not excellent.*** Tips/Suggestions From me : Turn on Hall and surround music effects & balance the bass/treble and Instrumental/Vocal from your phone for better sound quality as per mentioned screenshot.After turning on these effects, you will feel that you are in heaven of music world..After using these effects you can't feel irritation in long period of listening music, it provides you soft music..Note : I'm using it, and i can modify the review as per performance.."
Not enough range,4.0,"I've been using this headset for over a year now.Still functions as good as a brand new one. Great battery backup and great audio quality.But the device does not have enough range. If the headset is not within close proximity to the paired device, the audio is interrupted, sometimes it even disconnects from the paired device for only a short distance(like just going into the next room) . It's not a big issue for me, but this is a negative aspect of the device I have to point out.But overall experience is great. I do not regret buying this headset (I bought it for INR 900/-)."
STOPPED WORKING WITHIN A MONTH | DISAPPOINTING CUSTOMER SUPPORT,1.0,"The earphone stopped working within a month after the purchase. No response on charging, no LED light blinking, nothing. Very disappointing!If this wasn't enough, the customer support is even worse. There is no way to register a complaint on the BOAT website, they just tell you the address to the nearest service center.Expecting your customers to visit a service center amidst a pandemic, just for an earphone, is not what you'd expect from a company that literally has the words 'next generation' and 'trendsetting' on its warranty card.This was my first BOAT purchase, which I had made after being impressed by the product portfolio, branding and the fact that BOAT is an Indian company. But with such a disappointing customer support service, I may have to reconsider my future purchase decisions."
One of the BEST Earphones in this price range!,4.0,"One of the best quality earphones.Great Build Quality. I don't think anyone would have any problem with that.Great Sound Quality. Clear Sound.Noise Cancellation. Good but scope of improvement.Great fit. If you are going out for running with this earphone, you won't any issue.Good Bass Quality.Highly recommended if your budget is in the price range up to Rs. 1500.Will leave another review, once I try the one plus bullet earphones."
Quite nice!,5.0,"The battery backup is excellent. Indeed a great companion for travellers and all those who do not have all-day access to charging points.With normal use it retains enough juice to keep running for at least two days, if not more.Water resistance capability is best in class as well. In times of a pandemic, one is compelled to shower sanitizing spray on electronic equipments. This withstands the liquid pretty well.A perfect purchase!"
Awsome quality and warranty service is best which I never get in my whole life,5.0,Boat headphones are based in india.its sound awsome.price is also in range.i really thankful for boat warranty service which I never get in my whole life.my b.headphone sound drop .then contact in customer care.upload my address with bill.they take the product from home and contact every 2days.otherwise msg and mail also.tracking no given also .repaired product given me within 10days.its customer care are really powerful.if customer service is too good then you can purchase any product  from this company.
Redesign ear plug as per 2nd Picture.,3.0,All the features mentioned above meets customer expectations based on value for money . One feature of the product needs rethought in design modification. Ear plug provided doesn't firmly fitInto ear lobe. Very difficult to keep the plugs in place. 2nd picture shows the better design and gives a firm grip.
Not Recommended,1.0,"I have purchased the boat earphone [boAt Rockerz 255 Sports in-Ear Bluetooth Neckband Earphone with Mic(Neon)] on 29 Jul 2020, after sometime it disconnects automatically from the device or produce guitar type irritating sound on call so I raised the support case to replace the product under warranty period.They replace headphones and the new product got delivered to me. The worst thing is that this time the product I got is not the same which I ordered. My product which I purchased was [boAt Rockerz 255 Sports in-Ear Bluetooth Neckband Earphone with Mic(Neon)] but the product I have received is BassHeads 220 N In-Ear Wired Earphones which is very cheap as compared to my product. I have tried to contact their support team but they didn't respond to my emails or call.Disappointed with their service."
This device failed to connect seamlessly while working with MS Teams app calls / meetings.,3.0,The music from any app works fine and bass is average.The main purpose I purchased this device is to connect via bluetooth for calls for computer / mobile and move around while i speak. Unfortunately this purpose was not resolved.  The device fails to keep the connection with computer app or mobile app while in call in MS Teams app even if we sitting in front of computer / mobile. Makes a noise which is undesirable.On the other hand it works fine with music from youtube / amazon music app.So if you are looking such device will solve the problem of
Good headsets,4.0,Does the job for bass lover this product bis exceptional. But not for those who don't like bass because bassless songs are struggle to produce clear sound. Medium is excellent but lower volume it struggle to produce pour quality.  Maximum a little bit na ki barabar distortion on some songs. As per price point no complaints (((((chalega))))
Value for Money and Classy Feels.,5.0,"I bought Black colour Model and After Using it for more than 10 days i am Writing this Review. The Sound quality, Noise Cancellation, Built Quality everything meets my expectations for this price range. The Color Black suits me because it goes with anything i wear and it was cheaper than other color models . I have also used it in Moderate rain and it still works fine, which states truth of IPX7 Protection. Battery life is best feature, i have myself used it for 5 days without any charge . Charges in less than 2 hours (approx 1.5 houds)if completely drained. Looking for a headphones for using and Not Bragging ( Kind of basic look , not too fancy and you can't flaunt with this colour model ), this is the one."
If you are gonna need some good quality music go for it!,4.0,I have been using it for like 3 months and everything is really good. However it has a very big demerit that is the wire length is very high and looks so awkward. The control buttons aare not present in the neckband but in the wire to the right ear which makes the right sided earbud weigh more and causes discomfort when you go outside. It is only recommended for the persons who are not mobile i.e not moving.
Product which is overrated,2.0,"- The quality of sound is good.- It is made in China product, conflicts the claim of make in India.- the ear buds are made of poor quality material. Due to this, it is hard and irritating to ear within short time of usage. It is key for any earphone to be comfortable for ear which is missing here while designing.- Overall quality of material built is inferior."
Expectations not met. Totally disappointed with this purchase.,2.0,"Totally disappointed with this purchase. Had high hopes since I was happy with the wired earphones from boAt which was of amazing quality and lasted for more than a year. Just 1 month into using this Rockerz 255 pro, my right earbud stopped working. I can only listen through the left earbud though nothing went wrong with function buttons and speaker. Was satisfied with the sound quality but in the end I was only able to use for a month. Did see negative reviews but did not heed them since I trusted this brand through my experience. There is 1 year warranty but don't know how to avail the benefits as there was no response from the calls that I made to the numbers provided alongwith. I guess it would have been a great purchase if it lasted longer as I have no other complaints whatsoever on the product."
Value for money,4.0,Got this for 1399 during lighting sale.. it is worth for what u paid.. don't expect toooooo much performance.. it is value for money that's it.. yesterday afternoon I have received this product. That time battery was 100%. It is always connected with my phone.. after using of nearly 12 hours (only connected with phone. I am not using for audio & video purpose. Approximately I have used 2 hours for audio and video purpose) now it's battery is 60%.. it is okay product
Very good product,5.0,"I used these earphones every day for many hours. They worked very well for so long although I used them very roughly. After extensive usage for one year, there is a problem with the earphones as the wire got twisted and damaged. When raised the repair request on their company's website, Courier person came and picked up the product and after a few days, I received a replacement product. The company didn't asked for any courier charges which is a very good service."
"Do not buy, Warranty is a SCAM",1.0,"Pros:Decent bass and clear sound qualityCons:Bluetooth range - not so good.Warranty is a scam :The right side of my earphone stopped working after 8 months , was in warranty so was replaced.BUT the replaced earphone though looks same is of very inferior quality.Connects to only one device a a time (the original one connects to 2 devices)Range is even worseSound quality is ok but not as good as original oneBATTERY: Goes straight to 0 from 80% every single time , since the 1st day i received the replacement.DON'T BUY THIS, better go with JBL or add some money and go with One Plus."
Zero noise cancellation and Connectivity issues,1.0,"After 15 days of research I ordered this product. I got the neon one. The band is flexible and lightweight. I mostly use this while I go for cycling, on the first day, I just kept my mobile in the front basket of the cycle I was not able to hear any sound from the earphone. Later I moved my phone somewhat near to me then I'm able to hear songs. This is the first thing which I didn't like. Second thing was there is no noise cancellation, very poor noise cancellation. People on the other end of the call are able to hear everything from the background. They are not able to hear my voice properly, background noise was so clear that they disconnected my call telling that they're getting headache. After this incident I immediately returned the product. Usually I don't write reviews for anything, whether it's good or bad. But if I don't write many users will buy the product unknowingly. So do not go for this product. It is not good in any way. Leave about bass and all. There's is no noise cancellation and poor connectivity issues."
Worth a Try for Rs. 1100,4.0,"You'll find many reviews about it, but i would like to compare it is my previous realme neckbandMy points1) Megnet is not upto the mark (namesake), realme neckband Megnet is so much powerful2) Megnet does not have any functional capabilities like on/off3) Bass is ok....I mainly bought it mainly for long calls as microfone Housing is somewhat near to mouth compare to others...... for casual music and routine workout.... and it does it well...Suggestions..."
Don't buy warrenty product,1.0,The product was niceBut do not trust the warranty given by the company The whole thing is cheating I have made a request to the company if the product is not working they picked my product on May 21 /2021Product replacement on Twenty Days but So far two months have been completed Continuously I'm calling the boat guys But they bothered me a lot  plz don't refer to others
This is a great product and the battery backup is great and I plan to order it again.,4.0,"This is a great product and the battery backup is great and I plan to order it again. This product was delivered to me on 21-Oct-21 and since receiving this product I have not recharged it even once. It's surprising but it's all about to my usage. I have liked the one product here other than the oneplus bullet wireless z. Sounds quality are good and Bass is also good, Environmental Noise Cancellation is also good and It's perfectly fit to my ears. I would highly recommended to buy it. And thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd Seller and also Amazon to Timely delivered my product.Sounds Quality GoodsBass is also GoodEnvironmental Noise Cancellation is also good I'm mostly using this neckband on driving but carefully on road and background noise not disturbing any conversation."
Worst boat product ever!!!,1.0,"- Audio issue - when playing YouTube, insta video etc. audio is breaking continuously.- Audio is not so good its just ok type- connectivity issue - Disconnect several times after randomly- They claim battery backup 7-8hrs with 50% if volume, but actually battery back is only 4-5 hours with volume < 50%- There is other neckband with low price and great audio quality then this- I just returned this neckband,-DON'T BUY THIS WORST PRODUCT, MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING WITH THE ""CROWD"" :/"
7months use update,4.0,"Voice cancellation is jus not available. In six months off light use (twice a week) already one side earphone has got loose connection... Totally a no...This was my review at 6 mos, I claimed for warranty online, they picked up product and replaced it. Totally hassle free exchange.. So that's commendable I guess.. So giving 4 star sound has been great always especially the bass. Awesome service guysüëå go for it"
A Mediocre product,3.0,"1. The battery indicator only shows in miltiples of 20%.100%, 80%60,40% and 20%. Once it reaches 20% it's pretty much unusable as it keeps on promoting""Battery Low"" which is very annoying.2. The battery does not fall linearly. Almost half if the runtime will cause it to fall to only 80% and the next thing you know you're already at 20%3. he charging takes an eternityüòí4. Build quality looks good, buttons feel sturdy enough5. Audio quality is mediocre6. Would've been better if it had a c-type connector instead of micro-usb7. Audio breaks and/or stutters when you leave your phone in the other room. Bluetooth 5.0 may have solved this issue8. Did not have any issue with pairing and connecting9. Would've loved the auto on/off feature when it the earbuds are held together or pulled apart magnetically"
Earphone cables are a bit lengthy that makes irritation,4.0,"In terms of price range it is a good earphone but not the best one. Sound quality is good, no issues with battery life and also feels very comfortable around your neck. Sometimes the connection was breaking while you are travelling by vehicle but it is not a big issue as it happens rarely. The only thing that I did not liked was the length of cable. It was really a bit long that can make some disturbance to you especially when you are not listening to music and casually hangs it from your neck. However the magnetic effect was working very fine."
Best in range and Serves the purpose,4.0,I personally have a problem with headphones as none of them would fit into my ear during running and workout.But trust me this one is the best as it has better sound quality and doesn‚Äôt slip off.Got this one during festive season at 999rs.It has descent battery backup as well.My marathon run has become more enjoyable now.Thanks Team Boat.. üëçüèº
Value for Money,4.0,"I wasnt expecting the world after reading the reviews, but these seem to work pretty well for the basic purposes. Noise cancellation, as expected is average. Bass is slightly low for my liking but over all sound quality isnt bad at all, especially given the price. I would say, for a pair of everyday earphones, these are definitely a good choice. I have been using them for a week or so, shall update review in a month if need be."
Good for music but not for call - A Honest review after a year of Use....,4.0,"At this budget, this earphone is very good. I am using this earphones for almost a year. This earphone is very good for normal music. Don't expect too much of Audio quality. The call quality is pretty decent. No ANC is available, so if you are in a noisy area or under the fan, it will definitely affect your voice signal at the other end, so the receiver might not hear your voice very clearly. It can connect up to two devices at a time. I am connecting both my phone and laptop at a time, therefore it satisfies my need of having a single earphone for multiple devices. Given the price segment, this is one of the best earphones. Go for it without a second thought if you want one in a budget segment."
Product good but after sales service centres inadequate,5.0,"Hi Boat.!First of all You seriously need to increase service centres in Delhi. Last checked - just 5 for whole of Delhi.!! That's ridiculously low.Purchased rockerz 255 pro on 3rd May, it developed snag on 1 September. Went to service centre in karol bagh on 3rd. Was shocked to see atleast 100 people waiting for their turn to enter 10x10 service centre. Took me 3-4 hours to get the complaint registered. Must add, staff was very courteous. Now will get replacement product in 9-12 days.Please look into this."
Excellent product go for it üëå,5.0,"Boat is a company which is known for it's quality and  affordable prices it's a company you can trust I got these rockerz 255 pro + at 1300 let me tell you about these crazy piece of metal my order was delivered within 3 days  here is my experienceSound quality -Sound quality is excellent  it has 10mm sound drivers which gives your neckbands  a deep bass and clear sound  if you are a bass lover, you'll love it even more ,voice of music never distorts at high volumes even at 100 percentCalling -Calling feature is quite good and sound is perfectly clear you can easily cut and pickup calls by using the multifunction buttonBattery-The best feature about these neckbands is the battery it has a massive 300 mAh battery which is pretty long lasting I used these neckbands straight for 6 days from the day of delivery with daily time usage of 5 to 6 hrs at 80 to 70% volume still it showed 40% battery left which is impressive charging is also very fast 10 min charge will definitely give you upto 8 to 9hrs playbackAdditional features -It has active noise cancellation which gives it a clear soundYou can connect upto 2 devices at a timeBuild quality looks luxurious and it hasCons-Only problem with these neckbands is that sometimes it gets uncomfortable in your ears if used for longer durations"
"Don't work with laptop, Poor voice quality with mobile as well. No deep base as mentioned",2.0,"Poor voice quality at this price, my wired earphone at 455 providing same quality.I have to raise volume above warning level to listen to the music videos from mobile.Not working with Laptop at all, voice breaking after 1-2 seconds.Poor Bluethooth needs to connect manually everything with laptop and mobile as well, No auto connect.So I am returning this item, not useful at all as I specially need with laptop as well.I had Intex 201 Road Headphones which was having 10x better voice and mouth deeper base and 24 hrs backup,  I was used to charge after 4-5 days. I was feeling like theatre with less than the full volume. which was cheaper, I bought that at 999 only."
Ok ok product not up to the mark,3.0,After using of 7 days I am sharing my experience build quality is goodBattery back is good almost 8 hrs long after one chargedThe wire looks weird in your neck the length of the wire is too long it seams touching to near by your navelMagnetic part is work prety well but in only 7 days the logo of Boat is getting fadeSound quality is good but not up to the markWhile driving the 2 wheeler wearing this headphones the disturbance while listening the music online experienced couple of times may be due to lack of connectivity of BluetoothMost bad thing about this device is it captured surrounding sound very quickly/easily better than your voice during on call ppl compleining what's going on near by you so my main purpose of purchasing this is not solved thoroughly as I want noise cancellation during call but it totally failed I purchased in 999 bucks
THIRD CLASS SERVICE AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT,1.0,"NO WARRANTY N NO GUARANTEE FOR THE PRODUCT IF YOU FIND ANY DEFAULT OR WANT SERVICE THAN U HAVE TO WAIT MORE THAN 6 MONTHS . IT MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE MOREOVER NO REPLY OF EMAIL &  CUSTOMER TOLL FREE NUMBER THEY DIDN'T RECEIVED ANY CALL OR IF THEY RECEIVED THEY WILL MAKE PROMISE THAT THEY WILL DELIVERY THE ITEM WITHIN TOMORROW ONLY BUT THEY DIDN'T DO SO.SO, MY BUYER PLEASE BUY ANY OTHER COMPANY BUT NOT BOAT COMPANY.REGARDSXXXX"
Dissapointed with this model.. Thought to return back,1.0,Dissapointed with this model. I love boat heat sets. But this model has many flaws. Speaker volume is very low. Speaker magnets are not that good. No auto switch off and unpairing when we remove the two speakers. Thought to return back
"Have trust in boat,but not this time...",1.0,"Very happy to receive the product well before delivery date,good work amazon.I bought these ones after seeing it's no of buyers,good reviews etc.But the product won't connect to the Bluetooth,It just would not show on my mobile/laptop while connecting through Bluetooth.I might have received a defective product,so can't comment on the sound,but the construction of the device is super good for it's price,packaging was also good,also you can connect to only a single device at a time if that matters.I had immediately applied for refund,as I might not go with boat again.My next most preferred earphones is the OnePlus bullets..."
Stop working within 3 weeks of purchase.,1.0,"I received my boatz earphone of 1 Dec,2021 and it stopped working on 19 December,2021. It would not start still after having full charge. Resetting the earphone also didn't help. And the worst part is the customer support of boat, they keep on cancelling my replacement request, I don't know why but they keeping doing it. Today is 30th December, 2021 and they have cancelled my replacement request for third time. Those who are looking for Bluetooth earphones just keep in mind that the customer support of boat is the worst. You can buy OnePlus or any other earphone with good customer support, because these devices tend to get defective after a while.Thanks for reading this review & regards."

Three cheers for boatüòòüòòüòò,5.0,"First when I opened the Amazon wrapper, I am little bit upset as the box is tampered and seal seeems to be broken, hence I thought the product may be used. But when I have just paired and start listening...just brilliant!!! Under 1.2k I don't think you can find better than this.Pros:Sound is crispy and clearMaterial and designPriceCon:Bass is not so high, but it is enough!!!Love the co. This is my third earphone from boat and I have never disappointed. Whoever want a budget earphone, just go for it."
Noise cancellation technology,5.0,I have placed an order this headset as it have mentioned that it comes with CVC noise cancellation technology but when I have tested this product it doesn't have any kind of noise cancellation feature. Then I have replaced the product but again I didn't get noise cancellation feature with headset. So I have returned this headset and got refund.I really like this headset so please help me with noise cancellation feature for this headset. Is it misleading or I have got defective product both times???
Highly recommended,5.0,"I got this beast for 1300 . And I am happy . Noise cancellation is good . Without songs u can use it to  meditate . I don't know a lot abt bass and all but sound quality is good . One week review , approx used it for 32 hrs in one week without charging and it is still showing 35 % battery . I still don't know abt water proofing and yes connecting to two devices ( phone and laptop) helps"
Comfort is the only issue,4.0,"Pros:1. Battery is superb, I have used it for 10 days with single charge.2. Can connect to 2 devices at a time, this feature is very useful for me during work to connect to laptop and phone.Cons:1. Not comfortable, gives ear pain, feels heavy. You need to keep your head straight cannot move much, may be because of the cable type.2. Cannot use during work out, comes out of ear, specially the right ear bud because of the weight of seperate controller in cable. Controls should have been provided in the module itself."
Honest review after use of one month.,4.0,"In this budget range this is the best heaphone. Sound quality is inadjestubaly great, and bass is good enogh for this price range.1.Sound quality#Good points.*Best quality in this price range*Heavy sound recognisable even in low voice*High and low pitches are identifiable*Great experinece for 6+D Musics#Draw backs*In louder volume music can be heard by third person*long period of use causing heavy ear pain.2.Bass#Good* Good in price range* Gaming sounds are realistic#Draw backs*Extra bass for music is not available3.Noice cancellation#Good*Use for calls*In low traffic Noice cancellation is much helpfull#Draw back*Not Usable in heavy traffic*Weak cancellation in noisy condition4.Connectivity#Good*Bluetooth version 5 is available*Can get the range of an average 10m*No lag in the time of any type of videos#Drawback*Sometimes connection loss in time of calls*Lags experience in the time of gaming.It is the best earphone in this price range. Easily connective to an device and easily carriable and good body condition."
Best but very Costly,3.0,"This product is very good. My wife is using it since a year. We had purchased it for Rs.890/-. Thus Rakshabandhan, I wanted to gift this same earphone to my sisters however price has increased to Rs.1500/-. This product is worth buying however I have given 2 stars less just because the earphone being an old model, they have increased it's price."
Good product in this price range,4.0,The product is good in its price range along with boats quality and confidencepros:Good battery . It lasts about 6-7 hours with moderate use.Design and style is appreciableProduct build quality is fine.The bluetooth connectivity is good. Covers a decent range .cons:The buds aren't comfortable . Ear will hurt after a while .The bass and volume are not up to the mark when compared to wired headset in this price range.Problems with audio while connected to 2 devices simultaneously.Conclusion: The set is good for people looking for the benefits of bluetooth connection. Not recommended for people who wants high audio quality and bass.
Waste of money,2.0,"I gave a 2 ‚≠êfor this product just because of the battery capacity. It's battery is excellent. So being this big battery actually made this the worst, it's actually because of there design. It's really heavy. The battery part(which is the part where the battery,charging,volume and power button is located) is damn heavy and is placed alongside the right earbuds wire(As you can see in the picture of the product). Because of this even after wearing the headset properly, it's always leaning to fall from my ear(especially when I am joggingüèÉ it always falls from my ear(right ear only).  This is major drawback along with the terrible sound quality (very low sound and nearly deadly bass)"
Thank God I chose this one !,5.0,"You get what you pay for.Honestly... Its been almost 1 year and this product is performing the same as it did on the first day.Also it doesn't provide any kind of Delay while you're playing FPS SHOOTING GAMES like PUBG Mobile or Call Of Duty MOBILE.The only issue I went through, is a physical one.The charging port got loose and is now moving internally but it still charges the earphone at a certain angle. Although it just needs a simple soldering and its back to work again.Overall... Outstanding product !"
Excellent features Bluetooth neckband,5.0,"It‚Äôs a very good product. Quality is fabulous. Also it‚Äôs material is durable . Sound quality is also nice which give some extra bass. Battery backup is almost if 7-8 hours and requires 1.5-2 hours for fully charging. The design of the product and the available colours make it suitable for daily use. It automatically turns off if not in use for about 15 minutes. Moreover, it has magnetic earbuds. The product also comes with 1 year warranty. The product got delivered the very next day when I ordered the neckband. I really liked this boAt Rockerz 255 sports Bluetooth neckband. You will also definitely like this Bluetooth neckband."
Don't get influenced by the celebrity ads,1.0,"Absolutely poor quality sound, very low volume, lousy bass. I would have even ignored the sound but for the fact that the earphones just don't fit properly. Even with all the options given. These are only suitable for walking at a leisurely pace for those who are on a very tight budget. NOT recommended for running or jogging as the earbuds will keep popping out. I  returned the originals once thinking I had a defective piece but the replacement too had the same issue. Spend a little more and buy something better."
Facing issue with whatsapp video call,5.0,"When I'm trying to do video whatsapp call, the video paused during the call. When I turn off Or disconnect bluetooth connection the call normalize. I tried almost everything by unpairing the headphones and check all possible settings but still facing the same issue."
Great product!,5.0,"I really loved these headphones. My intent to buy them was for the gym and they completely solve the purpose. They are light weight. Easy to use headphones. I also use them for all my calls now, it is saving me from all that radiation we take from using the smartphone on our ear. Really happy with it."
A small view after using it,1.0,Bad product... within one year right side connection is lost... totally fake product..I was bought it with around 1500 rupees but now it's available with only 900 rupees..but finally products are fake...on the other hand we can't repair this due to absence of service centre...
Good buy but not sure of battery life,3.0,Head phone is good but after talking for some time i noticed a flaw or a fault when the head phone is on 60% and if u r talking it will be beep twice after sometime and it turn off. Maybe a fault not noticed or I have a faulty headphone. Noise cancellation not so good in this headphone and not recommended for Gym lovers as the headphones don't stay put for a long time.
not worth it,2.0,"Its been an year after I have bought this product and I would say it's not at all good. Sound quality, noise cancellation are all fine however in a span of one year I had to send the product thrice to get it repaired. Everytime one of the side stopped working and this was same with many of my friends as we ordered one after the other. For first three months it will work fine but the the problem starts. Even to get it repaired it takes weeks in resending and getting it back."
"Worthful among all competitors in the market , even better than from some of high range products",4.0,"Really a good product from boat , I bought it @ 899/- during festivals, it's a quality product having good bass , very good noise cancellation so you will never get complaint about sound missing while talking to someone and simultaneously it has a good bettry back up as well . Totally worth it to buy it from Amazon, beware to buy it from other portals ,  one of them delivered me a same korain product which is not genuine,  so returned it back and then ordered from Amazon."
Don‚Äôt buy,5.0,I bought these wireless boat earphones but after using them for a month I mean this product really  just disappointed me because the mic is not working also one ear speaker is too and when i complaint about this in the online site of boat they are not allowing me to exchange or you can say they are not helping me out
Worst Seller  Imagine Marketing India  Private Ltd. - Boat brand - Worst Brand  not  trust worthy,1.0,"I had bought this  product on September  2019 , Within 5 month  its once side was not working,I logged a complaint  In march , as per warranty clause  This Imagine Marketing India Pvt Ltd. ( a cheap product selling company) was liable to give  free replacement, Till due date  was  on i did follow up with  their customer service number , they  gave me reason of pandemic and said  their will be delay and  will be provided replacement as soon despite of delay,Despite of several call  I had escalated  this mater to  their administration email id.  And now they have removed my complaint  number 1054133 from their system. And not even bothered to respond to my mail, call back .Already  boat  products are very worst in performance and  this  is not brand product, i thoroughly regret to chose this cheap- boat product , i realized brand is brand Boat - is cheap product selling , it is not at all  a Brand . Pay some extra money but don't go for such a cheap product."
TOTAL SCAM,1.0,"This product is like a total scam. I ordered this product and received a product which had only one side working the other side of the earphone was not working. I initiated a replacement.The next day I received another product which is visible in the photos.The product does not contain the 6&9 of the earphone.This product seemed that it was already used and just handed over to us.This company selling this product is a total scam and would not even give 1 star and totally not recommended.Thank you.After replacement also, the 6 and 9 given are chopped off and clearly it shows that someone else used it."
genuine sound quality,3.0,Before bought this read most of reviews it mentions as  Immersive Sound but this will be a better choice having a more balanced sound1.genuine sound vocals very clear2.High bass3.Less treble4. Average build qualityCompared with my previous Sennheiser CX 275 this one less quality only.if your in very tight budget if you want to purchase Bluetooth neckband go for this otherwise dont buy.
Quality not good being a big brand,3.0,"'boAt Rockerz 255 Pro in-Ear Bluetooth Neckband Earphone with Mic(Teal Green)' product is v good but I have to return back within week after receiving the product  as the net in earphone was damaged.  They replaced within week. After use for 10 days,  left hand side earphone stopped working. Again I have to sent it back for repair. Now, 9 days has passed still waiting for the product after repair. Please send it soon. Thanks."
Unexpected quality product recieved,1.0,"I received the product on 22 Aug 21. Upto 15 days the headphone was ok, but later the button stopped working, neither it offs, i have to keep it on continue, all 3 buttons are not working, did not expected thisfrom boat. Sound quality is good, bass is ok, noise cancellation is not as expected. They say thart there is 1 year warranty, so how can 1 replace my product. I need a replacement for my headphone, now where do i contact, as the replace window is closed. Plz kindly suggest me where to replace the headphone."

"Nice product, great sound.",4.0,"I bought this product in sale, so got it in very affordable prices.my first impression towards the wireless earphones are not so good, as it comes with some constraints in which battery issue is one of the major.but after purchasing this product my perception is completely change, this earphone has a very nice battery backup, I have used this earphones since last couple of months but still I have not facing any issue for use this product. also has a very nice build and durable quality.I recommend to all who wants to buy wireless earphone in affordable price."
Okay product.,3.0,"Built and finish is good. Don't expect much from sound quality it's good by price. Just arrived. First impressions.After use extensivelyPros: best battery, best for binge watching, connection range, calling.Cons: not for exercise, not for running, not for music, No app for updates, earplugs get loose in workout."
Better go for other models,3.0,"Have been using it for past 8 months and below are my observations.Its been an average earphone that does the job.But more than liking it, I am disliking it.Cons:1. We need to press power button for few seconds to on/off and wait for 10 seconds or something to be complete the boot up.2. Doesn't have magnetic on/off features which are available in other earphone of similar range.3. Battery life is low. I am able to manage with office calls for a day.4. Most thing i hate is the long charging time. Takes more than an 1.5 hrs to charge from 0 to 100.Instead of this just increase the budget and go for oneplus Bluetooth Earphones."
Good but with a pain,3.0,Awesome speakers with good amount of bass...at full volume you might get a headache but around 80% sound max you can enjoy your music. Got it delivered today and after 30mins or so..my ear started to pain...not comfortable...battery is not great 100-80% in 10mins usage...my be i need to charge more as a first time..charged it for like 10mins and the was full - the blue light was on and i used...Overall OK product but my ear hurts
Quality compromised however model name is same,3.0,"This is my 2nd boat rockerz 255. The one which i used before had a little bit more clear sound in terms of mids and lows, it was a tat louder aswell. The 2nd One which i purchased 2 weeks ago seems having the same model number but the quality has definately been downgraded, the branding on back of the earpiece has also got washed out in 2 weeks. I beleive this has been purposely done by boat as there is a high demand of this earphone and they are selling it at their lowest price ie 999 during the sales.The people who had the old make and has the new make aswell will definately understand what i am saying. When connected to bluetooth the old one said ""you r now connected to boat rockerz 255"" however the new one says ""you r now connected to boat rockerz"" this is one of the difference aswell.Boat will loose customers faith if the downgrade their product and sell it with the same name."
Terrific purchase,4.0,"Review for this product is always positive as the product itself is amazing.Bass is very much exceptional as we can expect it from any of the Boat accessories.Audio quality is Good.It gives 6 to 7 hours of battery life on continuous music play or movie time. While gaming it gives approximately 10 hours of battery life, I personally tested it.But one cannot put it on ears for a very long time. Ears start aching a little after 3 hrs of uninterrupted usage.Connectively is very good. Sometimes it gives normal glitches but still there is no need to bother about it.My overall experience is Highly Satisfactory and worth buying it!I Recommend to buy it without any hesitation.  Very good product at this price range."
Good for call and bass songs,5.0,I m happy with this. I use this for calling and music the bass is Extremely good and for music this is good but battery life not so good and all things considered good and Sounds is loud not as loud as wired earphone but it good and Bluetooth is really good. Sound is much better than Other can used for gaming too much better results for Gaming Thrill and Sounds but Bluetooth sound delay is there in evey Bluetooth earphone so it can bee ignorable And every thing is good with boat But you also Have to try Ptron it also good to but better hey Ptron love thanx Boat bass ka baap hey maja aagya bass quality se or sound achhi hey ThanxHARSH SINGH.
Bad Bluetooth connectivity,1.0,Worst product I haver seenMultiple try than it will connectI does not support dual devicesNoice cancellation is ok to the extentRange of this product too much lowI buy this product because of nameNow I regret why I purchase this productIf you ask they can replaceI already replaced and they send this worst product as there is one time warranty they take advantage of this send worst productI buy this product without discount means rs1500Now one can understand how bad product is itNot RS. 999Better to purchase product worth RS 350I regret but I can't do anything other than this
Only Replacement item no refund,3.0,This is a good quality ear phones with durable wire. But the wire is very hard not so flexiable and big compared with other earphones. This doesn‚Äôt fit to a pocket for sure. It has a magnetic base which combines two sides when not in use. The major thing is that this ear phones once bought cannot be returned only replacement option is available in amazon which is quite disappointing
"Must have earphone, but its not perfect",5.0,"Love these around the neck earphones, good sound. The only issue, minor detail is I don't understand why Boat placed the minus volume button on top n positive below on control tab. Its the wrong way around. All headphones have the positive on top n negative below."
#Stupid policies #Disgusting services,1.0,I ordered the boat rockerz 255 sports earphones and thr is a problem in the bluetooth connectivity as the signal drops also the battery backup is not good and not working upto 6 hours which they have mentioned in the detailsThe most disturbing is when i asked the customer exceutive to return it its not ina policy and when i asked to ship a replacement order pickup and drop on my new address they are unable to change the address. This is the kind of services amazon and policy they have.#Stupid policies#Disgusting services
Great piece of kit.,5.0,"Absolutely great headset. I have been using it moderately and after over a week, I am still at 60% battery. Haven't charged it once since purchase. The sound quality is very good and the entire headset is pretty sturdy. I especially like the flat wires used and they flex quite well. I don't see these fraying at the joints until the wire just breaks. It connects to Bluetooth with all my equipment with absolutely no fuss.The one thing that niggles is the magnet that attaches the pods together when not in use is not powerful enough and they hang loose at the smallest pressure. Also, I miss the automatic switch-off when you attach the earpods to each other."
Good product for casual user.,4.0,"I got it fo rs.900+ in offer. Worth the money. Quality was okay for 900 but actual cost was 2000+ so for 2000rs its not up to mark. Sound quality was amazing. It cancel noise for some extent. In this price cant expct 100% so 5 star from ma side. Bluetooth connectivity s working fine so far. Can connect 2 device at once. So if u listn song frm any bluetooth device n u get cal from ua phone , u can recieve right away. Overall satufied by it."
Boat rokers,5.0,Battery life was good for few days did not get extension for one day for product replacement  as requested call centre exe but didn't work no service centre accept warranty for items purchased from Amazon .So big no next time  items purchased  from local shops as customer gets service .Too bad
Below average performance at this price,4.0,Not worth of RS 1599/- below average performance.If u music and bass lover don't buy it.If u also gamer lover don't go for it it has high latency rate you'll hear delay voice and sounds. Using this for one month.Not good for listening music.If u drive bike and use this has major problem that right side bud blow away from force air.Company claiming that this can connect two device at the same time it's false.If u connect with Mobile and then connect on computer u have to disconnect from first device and also delay in pairing. If u turn of mobile bluetooth and powern on Headphone it don't connect automatically you have to go to bluetooth setting and connect or on/off bluetooth of Mobile and laptop.
Good deal for a low price Rs.889,5.0,"Got this deal Amazon Great Indian SaleIt's a worthful deal at the price of Rs.899Battery life is around 5 to 7 hrs (not sure of the maximum limit)Good connectivityBass is little higherWire is little long but its best used for sports activities...difficult to hide device inside the shirtGoogle assistant works fineI doubt the durability of the wireIn short, best for the budget sports headset at low cost( Just wait for the deal and buy for 889 then if its not working after 7-9 months just replace it with another deal) just my opinion for low budget headset"
Read full review,1.0,"1.Design flaws: the neck band is oversized & has no spring action to lock around neck thus while running bounces off ur neck/shoulders which irritates & produces rubbing noise.2.Product defects: Bluetooth mic not functioning.3.Return policy Flaws: for COVID precautions, I disposed off the original packing immediately and thus now CANNOT return the item :("
Average prouct,4.0,I was going to buy a Bluetooth wireless headsets but couldn‚Äôt find a single one with good rating and ultimately purchased boat ones and they weren‚Äôt even getting connected to had to return them and purchased this instead.It does the work but isnt wireless entirely.Ok for the price.
Decent audio quality but keeps skipping...,5.0,"I've tried 3 different earphones of the same model and in each one I observed that the audio skips even when the phone it's connected to, is right in my back pocket.While listening to music, the audio quality is decent and battery life is about 5-6 hours depending on the volume levels. On calls, the audio is also decent and others were able to hear me clearly.Overall, it's a decent pair of in-ear earphones within 1500 bucks as compared with JBL."
Best quality and sufficient back up. Connects to devices fastly.,4.0,Connects to 2 devices simultaneously. Sound quality is good. Charges fastly. Nice to buy. Very good mic quality so no issues of voice on the other side. Very useful devices for talking in meetings while WFH.I bought second and my brother is happy with it.
It's okay. Could have been better,3.0,"I bought these for ‚Çπ1,500. And this review is edited after 7 months of usage.Cons:-1.My battery life drained to just 45 min working in 1 month usage. Though it might be because I used a higher voltage charger than what was instructed.2. One thing that I hate absolutely is the the greeting tone when you switch it on or off. The voice is so shrill that it hurts my ear. So that might be irritating if you have sensitive ears.3.Sound quality is average. Base is normal, nothing to hype about.4. Some kind of a plastic coating started coming out after 7 months of usage. But no harm as such to the product.Pros-1. The wire looks feeble and weak, but it is not. More than 6 months of usage and no such complaint.2. The sound is loud. Helpful for the ones who like listening to music on high volumes."
Value for Money,4.0,"Having used Senheissers cx275 wired in ear headphones, I find the sound quality average. But then this is a Bluetooth headphone and for this price is value for the money paid. Bluetooth works upto a radius of 5~8 m with no obstruction between.Finally you get the value for what you pay for though I felt the sound quality could have been better."
Full review after 6 months of uses,5.0,Very good product for bass loverPro:1-. Good bass2- maximum sound level is good compare to other3- fines of earphone just create vaccume like so outside sounds is eliminated4- great battery backup5-charging time is very less6- a indian company product7- very comfortable for long usesCon:-1-design is not attractive.2- sound clearty is just above average3-after 6 month uses range of connectivity is also not good4-bit of heavy
Low quality product. Boat has disappointed me on my first purchase from the company.,2.0,1. Bluetooth range is poor - Disturbance even with a 10ft distance2. Multiple device support is bad - This is no longer a fancy feature. It is much needed. This device cannot connect and disconnect seamlessly.3. On/off switch is weird - Sometimes the device is on and even after a long press of 30 seconds it doesn't switch off and doesn't connect to a device either.4. Hanging magnet - I do not understand why all BT earphones in India follow this design. Mpow Jaws has a brilliant design where the earphones have a slot in the neckband where they stick when not in use instead of dangling near the chest. Mpow Jaws is expensive in India but is cheap in the US where I used them for 4 years straight.Wish that companies like Boat can replicate such a simple technology and design in India as well.
It's must a good buy,4.0,"I felt when I listened any song I got its not as clear as it should be..I'm not not saying sounds quality is bad it's very good enough, I enjoyed a lot with pop songs ...I just saying clearity is not up to the mark but the base is extremely fantastic...one who loves bass in a song that person can go towards this product blindly... call quality is excellent but if you will buy this product to enjoy with BGMI as well ...this product is not made for yours..it happens not only with this all kind boat neckbands has sound letacy problem which gives you not up to mark experience while playing in BGMI...u have to use your wired earphone for this.. overall I love this product..hope for the best how it will be lasting üéà‚ù§Ô∏èüî•"

Worst experience I ever had,1.0,"Worst experience I ever had, waste of money.Received a defective piece, the sound quality is very low.The battery back up was given as 8 hours but its losts only in an hour and that too with decreasing volume.The device is not detectable for phones and laptops. Waste of money, the quality is very bad. I have uploaded pics as well, please think before buying it."
Great earphones üëç,3.0,"This earphone is very good and very comfortable. Very good for bass lovers and noice cancellation is decent. I brought this for 999 so I think it is worth the price. But if you are not used to the rubber tip it has for not slipping from the ears then it is a little bit itchy sometimes but after we are used to it then its not a big problem. The only problem is that there are no service centers near me I live in Thane and the center is in Andheri and the one I got here is not good, they never have the stock and always delays the service. Disappointed with the service"
"Poor bluetooth connectivity, poor batter back up",3.0,"Pros - sound is clear, fairly loud with less distortion, charges very quickly - in 20 min.Cons - poor battery back up, discharges equally quickly (max 3-4 hours). Keeps losing connection with your device even when you are sitting next to your phone or laptop. The connection, switch on switch off notification is very loud.Previously I had a Boult bluetooth headset. It gave me very good connection, very good battery back up and clear sound."
100 marks for this neckband,5.0,I just love everything about this neckband. Had a worst experience using JBL. After that I bought this one. I just love it. It has a fantastic battery life.. songs just sound amazing. Within just 20 mins charging I can use it for almost 5 hours continuously.
"Overall review(charge, battery, design, audio quality, noise cancellation and many)",4.0,Battery backup is good. It lasts for 3 day and night as an average usage.The buttons are too smooth and gets pressed with body movement.Bass is extraordinary as usual with boAt.Charged before 2 days and I'm using with that charge. So I'm not that sure about the charging time.The LED indicator is a bit disturbing at night asusual with boAt.Audio quality is great.Also has a high quality mode additionally.Strictly NO NOISE CANCELLATION.
"Very Poor mic sound input, Not useful for calls/meetings/WFH. Replaced device is also having issue",3.0,"I have purchased 255 Pro device 3 weeks back and I am already having 255 Sports device with my wife. This is my genuine feedback.When I started to use 255Pro for my meetings, there was always someone who complained me about my voice is too low. This was not a issue with 255 sports device. I compared the mic sound input quality in macbook by going in sound input settings and compared the sensitivity. 255 Pro mic sound input quality was very poor than 255 sports. Same issue was when I connected the device to mobile as well.I went to service center in Pimpri/Pune and got this replaced. When I check the same sensitivity again it was still same, very poor Mic sound/input quality.If you have finalised boat, then go for 255 sports instead of 255 pro."
Vinay,3.0,"Delivery service is worst. I was waiting for my order since morning as it was to deliver on Wednesday for God sake I didnot receive any call, when I checked in the app it showed me product is out for delivery. I tried to call the Amazon delivery number since morning, call rings n get disconnected. It was 7 in the evening, I called the number again call connected n delivery guy stated he will come in 2 hours. I was angry like anything, is that a tym to deliver the product ? I said to him I need the product urgently as I had to go out, however it got delivered at 8.30.Coming to the product it is good for the people who are looking for Bass. We cannot hear the words clearly, Bass is too high some times and it blocks ur ears completely cannot hear the sounds around you. Felt dangerous while driving n other situations. Battery will last upto 6 to 7 hrs when fully charged. However I bought it at discount for 899/- it is good at this price range."
Awesome Bluetooth Earphones,5.0,"Wow! More than what I expected.Sound quality - 5/5Bass - 4/5Noise cancellation - 5/5I received the product just some minutes ago so don't know about the battery back up. But I'm sure it must be good too.Overall, it's just awesome in this price range. You should definitely go for it.EDIT -After 11 months of usage, one side of the earphone was not working. Maybe it was because of my carelessness. But thanks to BoAt. I applied for a replacement and I received a brand new piece in about 25 days as it was still in warranty period. Just go for it without any second thought. Amazing earphone!"
"Good bass, Value for money, Magnet feature is good",5.0,"On time delivery and product is good.. the bass wasn't feeling great initially but after changing the in-ear buds with the bigger ones provided in the packing the sound was significantly better with better bass and treble. Easily connected to my mobile phone, Smart TV, and laptop. I got it on 26th October, today is 30th.. I have not had to charge it at all so far.. i use it for a couple of hours everyday.. so battery life also seems decent.It's good value for money. Would surely recommend."
"Superb battery life, built and heavy bass",4.0,"This product absolutely nails battery life, I hardly worry about its battery running out and then comes the sound, it has a bass heavy sound signature which you come to expect from a boat product, it fits well in my ears and provides some environmental noise cancelling, nothing like active noise cancelling but it is something, the built quality of my unit is pretty good using it for about a month now but still no loose ends. In conclusion, it is a good product if you don't want long and frequent charge times like me or you are a fan of boat's bass heavy music then it is perfect for you. Anyways at this price point it is quite compelling."
"Damaged exactly after the warranty expired, the product is good but expected a bit more life.",4.0,I bought the product at 899 in 2019 September on 2021 Feb ie exactly after 5 months of warranty expiring the product has been damaged.Also they do not have much service centers in tier 2 cities so please try to check the service centers also.Product users experience: The product is good has good sound quality but if your planning use it while driving a bike not so good as it attracts wind noise.
Near flawless,4.0,"After using this for almost a month, here is my review:Best things: Amazing battery backup (almost 6-7 hours), very good noise cancellation, comfortable, easy to use, proper sizeCould have been better things: The quality of sound could have been slightly better, I don't have any other complains.Absolutely go for it, best option in this price range. You will not find any other in this range that is this good."
Boat Rockerz 255 Sports. The Perfect Choice!,5.0,"This will give you worth of every rupee you spend. Don't go for boat rockers 255 pro because its almost the same (except bluetooth 5.0)PROS:1. Sound- compared to the non-pro version, it seems to me that there's slight improvement in quality. Not that it is very noticeable, but a slight improvement.Bass- has got good quality and quantity of bass compared to others in the same price range. The bass is clean, tight and is not muddy like realme bluetooth earphones.Vocals- the vocals are clear and crisp.Loudness- it is loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment.2. Comfort- the earphones are comfortable to wear but without the ear guides. Maybe that's just me, but wearing along with the ear guides gave me pain in the ears which eased off once the ear guides were removed.3. Design- it is of neckband design that is comfortable to wear. The buds have got magnets in it which helps it stick to one another when hanged down so that no tangling occurs.4. Colour- comes in some trendy colours like yellow, teal green, blue and red. The youngsters would love this just for that.5. Fast charging- gets completely charged in just an hour and has got high voltage protection too.6. Sound isolation- nothing to brag about but comparable with others in the same price segment.7.Mic- the calls were very clear. The person at the other end told me that the voice was audible without any disturbances and indeed very clear.8. Connectivity- this has got the A2DP feature. So dual connectivity is present and I did not experience any connection drops of any kind.9. No Lag- there was no lag experienced while playing PUBG.CONS:1. Battery- this is the biggest gripe anyone could have with this earphone. The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers. Though there's fast charging one would expect headphones in this price range to last at least 10 to 12 hours but not Rockers PRO lasts for almost 6 to 8 hours. That's what I got out of them and that was not enough.2. Price- the asking price of 1599rs is high. You may get it for 1200rs during offers. Even then it is not value for money because of the poor battery backup.3. No auto on-off with magnetic buds- the feature which is present in Realme bluetooth earphones. This feature could have improved the battery life of this pair very much but alas it doesn't have it.Final words:Boat Rockerz 255 Pro bluetooth earphones are good in terms of sound quality and trendiness but lack in terms of battery backup. Though there are several pros than cons it all comes down to the battery life and this one loses out on that badly."
Not good for runners,2.0,"It feels like some cheap plastic, not a good fit on your ears.Don't even think about it for while doing cardio activities, not a secure fit. The neckband model was a worst choice by me for such activities, should have opted for TWS earbuds.Sound quality is good when at home or some quiet place.The magnetic tips do not stay fit properly due to its uncanny design.Battery life is excellent though, I charge once in 5 or 6 days after extensive usage."
Value for money for price paid,4.0,I am using the earphones for two months now.Sound quality is good. Charging lasts for a day at the most. Dual connect feature is unique and awesome. You can connect on laptop as well as your phone at the same time. You can pause audio/video in one device and play in other device. Band is flexible which increases it's durability. While Sony offers better Bluetooth earphones at higher prices with longer battery life it lacks this flexibility. Noise cancellation does not work properly. If you are travelling and speaking on a call the other person will understand that you are travelling which is not the case with Sony earphones. One should assess one's needs and choose one to go for.Unlike Boat headphones it does not sound outside when turned On/Off (Those who have used Boat headphones will understand this better).
Depends on ur preference..,3.0,"Adding review after using this headphone for more than 6 months, actually i have not used it more thn 2 months, i dont know why , but somehow maby because of charging the headphone was quite boring for me, the headphone has verygood noise qulity,  which is not good for me as used to travel a lot on bike, so i must hear the surrounding sound for safety reasons.  This is my personal experienceRest about the headphone, the sound quality is good, balanced,  bass is also nice. Build quality is awesome.  If u r ok with charging it every day go for it.. i got it for 999.."
Sound quality is good but quite uncomfortable to wear for long or on bike ride,4.0,"Sound quality is good but quite uncomfortable to wear for long or on bike ride and especially with helmet on, it will start aching after sometime of use and very uncomfortable feeling. Also, I feel the band design has a big flaw as it's without a strap to hold earphones and it will come down till or below your abdomen if not in use and on neck.Otherwise, except design it's a very good product quality and output wise.Review after using more than 2-3 months."
ok headphones butt,3.0,"the sound quality is ok but there is a constant buzzing when it plays something. idk if its intentional like some noise cancellation trick or something but thats a small issue. The voice alert in this earphone is the worst. It shouts in a man's voice ""Power On! You've plugged in to nirvana!"" whenever you turn on the earphone at almost full volume. What nirvana? when you turn off the device it shouts ""Adios amigo, powering off"" i mean its ok i might not be a fan of such a UI but i can tolerate that much. But the worst part is when your battery reaches 10% i think, it shouts ""Oops, battery low"" every minute or so at full volume. like we get it the first time man no need to shout again and again. Imagine you are watching some movie or video on youtube and an intense scene is playing, you are completly engrossed in it and suddenly someone shouts in your ears ""OOPS BATTERY LOW!"" man that is super frustrating buy it if u can tolerate that obnoxious voice its the only con i can think of"
Fantastic,5.0,"I am writing this in the month of July, 2021 and I think it's the best in the market in that price range. Let me tell you why :1. I usually have to think when was the last time I have changed this headphone.2. I wore it in the shower to test it's IPX8 certification and it went smoothly.3. I will give 4.5 out of 5 for the sound quality and it your device compatible with AAC then your life is awesome.4. Comes with Bluetooth 5.0 support seamless sync with two devices.*Only con is : when you ware it the vol up key is in the bottom and vice versa for the vol down."
In reality it's poor,2.0,"The headphone doesn't have that good Bass as described. sound quality is also average. It has issues with Bluetooth connectivity when on call, voice doesn't pass other end as it does on wired headphone. Samsung wired headphones are better than this Boat Bluetooth headphone. Price is overrated compared to what they are serving.Charging stays very long and that's a good go."
Defective product received...,1.0,"Hi all,I got a product with defect... The problem i experience is... When ever you going to start or stop playing some audio... You will hear some fussy sound like ssssssss... for 2 seconds.. after that only audio will start or stop playing... this sound comes even before the notification tone...i never experienced like this in any of the Bluetooth earphones... I saw few positive and negative reviews before buying... I was convinced, beacuse of the price...And other factors i didn't like in this earphones is1) the wire is very uneasy to use... The neck part is semi flexible and post that wire length is too much lengthy even for a guy with very lengthy neck...2) the ear piece is not at all comfortable.. it keeps popping out...3) i didn't feel i am using a boat earphones... It looks bit cheap... Of course the price is less"
Will get your job done,4.0,"Well, I was eagerly looking for a neckband and after a lot of research I bought this one . The sound quality is good 8/10 the bass is present and does not look fake . If you are someone who is going to use them with your laptop you will be blown away by the quality it gives after some tuning. I personally loving them . The battery is decent as well easily lasts a day . The only problem which I faced is that when it is idle It automatically turn off itself which I don't like as I have to pair it again. The dual device connection work seamlessly . I never face any issue with that  .Overall it's a great buy I will rate it 8.5/10.Watch for the prices it will drop to 899/- during sales"
Good in this price range,4.0,"First of all, don't expect, it will look like pic... i doesn't look like premium quality. Look is gareeb type. I am bass lover.Baby ko bass pasand hai but itna bhi nahin jitna isme aa rha hai üòÇ after using  2 days i feel bass is over the top. You will miss the originality of song. I have used bass 100 headphones 350rs, and feel that was better. If I talk about pros: connectivity is good. Sound quality and 'bass' is also good in this price range, bettery is awesome.. So with this neckband, I can talk without holding heavy phone. Can watch webseries as it is not heavy like headphones. Can listen to songs... with extraaaaaaaaa bass."
"Only bass, nothing else. No service.",1.0,"P.S. one side stopped working. Warranty only on paper, as such non existent service.I don't even care about anything else if sound quality is below par.I've used many Boat wired earphones and they're decent. Too loud bass always but still you can hear highs and lows and mids fairly clear. This one has just so much bass there's almost 0 clarity."
Excellent Battery life with super fast charging,5.0,"Hi All,This is my first time writing a review on any product..And I felt like reveiwing this produt would help others..The delivery process was quick and clear..Coming to sound quality these ear phones make a way difference relatively whne it comes to noise cancellation and louder..the main interesting thing which forced me to write this review is about its battery life..I saw the website claiming 6 hours and it's true..for me it lated more than that..I started watching movies and stiff from 1 PM in the noon it's still running in the night 9 PM with some 30 % left.. ofcourse had a break of 2 hours in between..So if someone is looking for long hour usage go for this..."
Inconsistentancy in connectivity.  Some times mic stops working,2.0,After 10 - 12 days using I'm getting connectivity issue. It automatically disconnecting itself and try to connect again it showing only connecting connecting bt not get connected.Another problem facing with most of the time while talking on calls after few minutes mic stops the working so another person unable to hear me but I'm clearly able hear that person. In such condition I need to do either disconnect the call and call again or disconnect Bluetooth and connect again.I really want hear reply from boat team about these issue...
boAt 255 pro vs Protronics Harmonic Notes,3.0,"When I compare boAt 255 pro with Protronics Harmonic Notes (little old model) for sound quality,boAt Pros - Passive noise cancellationboAt Cons - Duplicate bass (unnatural), No punch, music feels like glassy (unnatural).Protronics Pros - Realistic bass (though less), Strong punch.Protronics Cons - No proper noise cancellation, all instruments seems little mixed up (need to try working on equilizer), lacks sharpness (kind of voice clarity).I reduced 2 stars for 255pro as it lacks the main things that a hip-hop music lover looks for.This doesn't mean all other boAt music systems are bad, I found some wired boAt earphones which was costing around ‚Çπ400/- little better than JBL wired T100A. On a similar note, Protronics Bluetooth speaker (SoundDrum) was far better than JBL or any other speakers which are in same price range or above its range."
Loved the headphones. Amazing experience üòç,2.0,"Just received my boat rockerz 255 headphones. It's just awsmü§©Update: I've been using it since 2 days, it's perfect in music, youTube nd all. But in google meet and zoom it can't be used at all. Voice breaks a lot and mic is also horrible in zoom and meet, and the main reason to purchase this earphones was to attend meetings without any issue, which it didn't fulfill at all. Also earbuds of this earphones are heavy So it pains a lot in ears if I use it for long time,which is the biggest drawback. So I refunded it.If u want to buy a earphone to attend meetings then don't buy this, but if u just want to listen good music with good bass and watch videos, then only u can buy this."
Good quality headset but not for Sports,3.0,"Since this item is from boat, I knew the sound quality should be very good. I'm absolutely happy with that. But the biggest issue I have, is the word ""Sports"". I'm a long distance runner and this product is not at all suitable for running. Oh yeah, you can comfortably watch sports on your mobile with this though."
Invest some more and get a better pair or go wired,3.0,"Better to invest sone more and get realme buds or from jbl. No noise cancellation or sound isolation.sound quality is moderate you can only use it indoor , in traffic or in public it doesn't isolate properly. Bluetooth connectivity is not good at all it disconnect within 10m range, and most annoying this is the battery backup, it take too long to charge and Max runtime is of 3hr at max"
Product replaced under warranty.,4.0,Good sound quality and massive battery capacity.But about 1 month of usage the product failed to power on due to manufactoring diffect.I claimed for warranty and company replaced the product fr free.Replacement duration took about 2 weeks.Overall good productGood customer support
"Good sports quality, waterproof. Acceptable sound quality.",5.0,"This is some awesome sports earphones a true sports gear. I've tried a number of sports earphones and they all fell flat-faced with the kind of sweat I get during workouts and I had to return or dump them later but this one withstood all i gave and still going great.Sound quality is okay but good for a wireless headset of this price range, doesn't matter for me as I use it for sports activity only."
Worst warranty service,1.0,"I purchased this in Jan 19 for Rs 1000 as part of some sale. Firstly, I was very diappointed to see that left side of the earphones stopped working within 5 months i.e. June itself. But I thought it is okay since the product was still under warranty, but let me tell you all.. I LOGGED THE REPLACEMENT SERVICE REQUEST IN JULY AND IT HAS STILL NOT BEEN REPLACED!!!!I never expected such bad customer service. Since July i have called their customer service a thousand times but it always says that all executives are busy currently. Then I raised another request online, still nothing to that too.I am planning to take it to consumer forum nowSo my conclusion is product is bad as it has chances of getting faulty anytime (in my case as early as 5 months) and service is even worse!"
Good one but not great !,4.0,"Eventhough it connects two divices at the same time, however audio doesn't switch to the first device connected.  While playing the audio from the first device connected, it doesn't work. Only it works for last device connected. We need to reconnect the previous device to get it works.Not sure manufacturing defect or functionality limitation.  Atleast it works flawlessly for other bluetooth headset like Jabra.ANyway it's light weight and sound quality is better than many other product of same price range"
Neckband with codeless Mic,5.0,"I am searching for a Neckband especially with a good Mic for this I tried many of the items but disappointment with the mic.After a long search of budgeted Neckband, I found this Nirvana from boAt Rockerz 255 Pro. Great product and I am writing this review after using it for one week. I am fully satisfied and suggest that people to go on with this model."
"Great headset for its prize & sound quality, But too lengthy!",4.0,"This is a good bluetooth headset for its process, sound quality is great and I recommend this for Bass lovers!Bluetooth coverage is pretty good but average!The only thing that that I hate in this is the LENGTH, when I put them it comes till below my chest, irritating while washing face etcSamsung Level U design is much more greater!Only that, apart for that this is a great one!I got it for Rs 999/- in Amazon Summer Sale early as I‚Äôm a prime member"
Best fit for my ears,4.0,"Excellent fit to my earsAlready used many in ear earphones but it's amazing fit. Sound quality good for the price. First time a neckband wireless earphone with 90% satisfaction. A friend had this and i tried, then i ordered this bcz of the exact fit to my ears (very comfort)"
Received Damaged Earphone,1.0,Unfortunately I received damaged wire of the earphone...I was unable to open at the time of delivery...just checked today itself...I don't know whether Amazon will return or change it or not... although have ordered many times but this is the first time I received damaged product..But still I do have trust on Amazon..Plz guide (@amazon) if it can be changed...thanks in advance!!
Very Nice Earphone under 1500Rs budget BT earphone.,5.0,"This Boat Earphone is Good in Sound and Nice product with all Functions like packaging,delivery,warranty etc. I recommend to other people they can buy this earphone with eye close trust."
Loved it,5.0,I loved them so much: till one day they just stopped working. I want to know if these can be serviced and used again.For a simple device the price of these bt earphones is very high and there should be a way to service and use them.But love love loved using them. Great for walking and running or bike riding
good instrument but the charging cable didn't work,3.0,"The product is good. Charge stands for more than a week for a moderate usage. But the charging cable that was provided with the handsfree did NOT work, It didnt fit correctly and charging did not happen. I am managing with my mobile charging cable. How can a good quality product can accompany a sub-quality or a broken accessory??1"
Good I am purchase only 899 quality is good,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I like it it good for me and every body beacuse 40 hours continue backup and ipx7 it's awesome in these price sound quality is good noise cancellation is good only bass quality is normal as compared to headphones otherwise overall rating 4.5"
Good for music but not best for calls,3.0,"The ear phones is good for listening songs but feel little high on bass for talking, and i am particularly don't like this type because when completely on you can listen your body movements loudly and which irritates.. other than that a good build quality and good sound quality for listening songs.."
Highly disappointed,2.0,"To be frank sound quality is goodBattery backup is goodBut the product had an ear attachment that is faulty, it keeps on slipping while wearing. To recomended for those who wish to wear during jogging or while travelling in busy places.I am totaly disappointed with the quality and i missed one ear attachment while travelling and now only one ear piece is useful for me."
Read this for a complete review and features of this item.,4.0,"If you're looking for a budget wireless earphones with more than decent sound quality, give it a go.- bass is truly amazing and sets it apart from other competing wireless earphones.- my phone is Dolby atmos configured, so the noise cancellation as well as the surround sound is excellent.- dedicated keys for volume control, pause play button are available. And you can switch to different songs by long pressing the volume keys.- connectivity is fast.- extra earbuds, a charging cord and a manual comes with the purchase.- I experienced a 6 hour battery backup on a single continuous use, so it's pretty good considering the budget.- takes an hour and a half from 0 to 100 percent charge.- build quality is valuable. A smooth design with durable body and the wire length is also adequate.- neck band is not hard and not too soft, just the proper amount of flexible so that it won't break easily.- one of the best thing about this earphone is the magnet inside the earphone speakers. So when you're not using it, you can stick them together while it's hanging from your neck.The picture shows how I keep/place it at home. It's the magnet.Cheers."
Worst and fucking customer service.,2.0,Worst experience. After purchasing of 6 months one side ear phone not working and placed for return the boat company. They have picked up the item but not returned still even after 30 days. Very worst experience after using it for 6 months. My friends also has same complaint. Plz don't buy.  The photo is uploaded of replaced ear phones. I have waited for more than 30 days for a small replacement. How can someone wait for so many days. The customer service shall be quick wen u have pblm. Plz don't ever buy this.
Good deal under 1k price.,3.0,"I got this one for Rs 900. After 1 week of using I'm giving this review.# Sound quality is decent, not as good as premium but ok.# Bass is moderate quality. Enough for me.# Noise cancellation is below average. It captures the noise of all your surrounding things. Not much helpful in traffics.# The battery is really poor. Maximum for 4 hours with volume 80%. One thing that I have noticed is the battery quickly drained from 80% to 0% in just few mins. That I really didn't expected.# There wasn't any problem with latency or mic issue while playing pubg. I'm not heavy gamer btw."
DOESN'T DO THE JOB WELL. DO NOT RECOMMEND.,1.0,"It is not good quality. Do not buy. Call quality on phone is not good (there is noise) and the moment you go outside your room the connection becomes weaker and noise increases. I have a small 2 BHK house; I went to the kitchen and the connection started to fail. The bass has been provided compromising overall call quality. One cant keep two earphones - one for music and one for calls. There are connectivity issues and it also takes unusually long time pairing with the device. Major set back for people who want to work from home using their office computer through remote connection. It doesn't connect to remote desktop. I work from home using team viewer to connect to my office computer. But the headphone doesn't work if i play audio in the office computer. My work is all about quality control and to listen to call recordings. It is not useful for me.  Also, the packet came damaged. I would not recommend this earphone."
Most Hardcore Bluetooth Earphone available,5.0,Pros :1) Excellent Battery Backup(Using it since four days on a single charge).2) Crystal Clear Hd Sound with no audio video lag.3) Durable flat wires.4) Looks and Build quality is awesome with magnetic earbuds.5) Sweat and Water Resistant.Cons :1) Call quality is good but Mic does not have noise cancellation so receiver receives noise.Verdict :Blindly go for it if calling is not your primary concern.

good product,4.0,"Ive been using this earphone for almost a year now. It works perfectly fine till now. The sound quality is okay. Its quite sturdy. it works for a reasonable time until you need to charge again. It has problems with the bluetooth connectivity especially when there is heavy wind, you cant hear anything even with 2-3 mts distance. Other than that it works fine."
Worst company with third grade products,1.0,"Having a tag of "" Indian origin"" doesn't necessarily mean that the product is of best quality.This is one of the worst company with worst service facilities.This is my first and last purchase from boat.I will never buy or recommend anybody to buy any of their products.Update :Guys don't buy this product. I have a lot of issues with this even after replacing twice.They just bought cheap Chinese earphones and sell us in the name of make in india. It's really frustrating for me to claim replacement warranty for twice and still they can't resolve the issue. I don't know whether they test it or not before sending it to the customer."
Awesome under care,4.0,Flawless quality output but only until water went inside drivers. Tried to blow with hair dryer but drivers were damaged. So it's waterproof only if both the drivers are closed i.e. in your ears. Tried for warranty claim but boat team didn't respond to my email. The service center location in website is wrong. So it's ruined now
Pathetic Experience,1.0,"I received these Earphones on 27th July 2021 and after Charging second time on 8th August they never started again, I mean On hi nahi huye dobara... 0 stars"
"Sound quality is not good, over bassed",3.0,"I brought this one, after using boAt Nirvanaa Uno. Uno had good quality stereo with nice bass. This is sounds like a mono headset. I think bass is too much or not set correctly. It sounds differently on Mobile  and PC. I am not satisfied with the sound output. It connects to both PC and Mobile same time, so attending mobile call and Skype call with no hassle. For Rs. 1990 there are better quality available. I trusted boAt based on my previous purchase with UNO."
Good Product. Horrible Customer Service.,2.0,"I am very much satisfied with the product quality in terms of sound, bass, and noise cancellation capabilities and would have given it a 5-star rating. However, the horrible experience provided by boAt customer service has made me rethink my decision, and I, for one, do not want to be a customer to a provider who cant take care of its customer satisfaction.All this mess is specially created when you try to claim the product's warranty within its warranty period. Despite leaving multiple mails and/or trying to reach their customer care via the phone number, the team's response is a shocker. Either they won't respond to their emails, or if you try to convey your complaint via a call, then the agent cut's your call in between without even listening to it completely. It's just pathetic. What's the use of having such ""customer care"" when you don't even listen to your customer?"
Sound quality ok but connection is a hassle,1.0,"The sound quality is okay but the biggest issue with the product is it's connectivity. We have to struggle a lot to pair it and even though it is shows connected in the corresponding system there is no response in the headset. It is a hassle to pair and connect it. Overmore the battery life is very short, the device drains out even in 3-4 hour. I wanted to return the product and that too is not possible. I am really dissatisfied with the product."
Complete satisfaction with Boat rockerz 225,4.0,"I love the boat rockerz 255. because of the nice crunchy base and clear audio ,it is quite perfect fit in the ear as well. But it take time to connect with the device . I use other ear phones as well the the boat audio quality is more liking to me.I use this earphone for 3 month now and I have no complete with this product.If any one is reading this I recommend to try is one."
LIFE OF HEADPHONE IS ONE YEAR ONLY,3.0,"I spend a 1 year with this headphone. It exactly stopped working after a year. The button which makes the headphone on is not functioning anymore. If the lifespan of the headphone is just one year, I do not recommend this product.I cannot claim now for the warranty and in a situation to throw this headphone.  If you are having a long term vision, avoid this product."
A good product of genuine review,5.0,"Quality's: It's a best Bluetooth headphones i used, excellent bass quality, best quality loud ness, nice build quality and awesome product.Battery life comes easily 2days of medium use... Good battery lifeRating: bass 4.7/5, sound loudness 4.8/5, sound quality when hight and low volume 4.6/5, Bluetooth design 4.2/5 ( cable length is little bit long ), water proof 4.5/5 ( i am used this headphones in small rain & not problem i noticed)And final thing is you can trust the brand ""boAt rockerz"""
Budget bluetooth headphone,4.0,Bought this @999. It can connect multiple devices at a time. Sound quality is good enough at this price. Build quality is very good. Bluetooth connectivity and battery life is impressive. You can use it for hours without any issue. It comes with different sizes of buds. I would strongly recommend if you are looking for something reliable for daily use.
Not worth one star either,1.0,Bought it after several good reviews about the product. I don't understand the hype at all.1) Too uncomfortable. Never stays in the ear and the earpluges are big (even the smallest in the size).2) I started getting headache after multiple use. I could hardly use it for few minutes.3) Can't use for call and the quality is too low. Had bought this for conference calls and every time I had to change to normal earphones.4) The wire hangs from ear looks funny.
sound quality awesome comes noise cancelation battery backup is good as well,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Sound quality best good looking controls amazing comes with noise cancelation easily pair with phone and laptop first product I received had hanging prob and didn't turn off but they easily replace my earphones and I got the new one today this is the best you guys can get in this prize I really love it it has everything as written"
Definitely not for sports activity.,2.0,"In terms of sound quality, it is good. But this earphone is not for sports activity. The cable is quite heavy which will not let the earphone stick to your ear on heavy physical movement.Range is not even 5 meters. As soon as you cross thredistance you start getting interruption.Bluetooth quality is way poor that when you are walking listening music and have put your phone on your pocket, you start getting interruption.Wire is way to long. Around 2-3 inches extra, which looks weird if you are not putting it on and just kept it on neck. I have given the image. I am 5.4. The earphone is hanging 5 inches below my chest.Overall, bearable for walking, but definitely not good if you want to buy this for jogging or exercise."
Left side is heard less / slow in compare to right. 255 was best in compare of 255 pro+,1.0,Left side voice is heard less / slow in compare to right and we have to srugle in call we feel we are hearing only right but actually left also is working but sliw in comparison to right.Music and videos also same position.I received today.Sound quality also not goid in compare to 255.Previously I had purchased 255 it was very good but in this problem.
"Waste product, Amazon should stop selling this product.",1.0,"As of now I've purchased 3 ear phones of boAt rockers, all were stopped working within its warranty period and there is no one who can help you for service /replacement. Let's not get in to trap by seeing the volumes of review. I would suggest Amazon to not degrade their market by promoting such company's device."
Everything is good except for bass,3.0,Everything is good but there's 3 huge problems in this earphone.1. If you're looking for a good bass booster earphones then this is not that good. Except for this if you ignore this it's actually not a big deal.2. If you by any chance lost any of the ear hooks you won't be able to buy a new one. And this problem is bigger than bass booster because earphone will stay in the ear without hooks. That sucks üòî3. Boat has also it's website where you can buy products from boat but they also don't sell extra ear hooks in case of if you lost them.Try to buy a earphone without those stupid hooks.
Decent buy in this price range,4.0,"After 1 month of usage,  this is what I have to say ..1st and foremost .... BATTERY BACKUP ..... AWESOME üî•üî• .... Charges up pretty quickly too . 5/5The bass is decent but those who like high base this is not for you ... 3/5Sound quality is great .... It's really clear and smooth . 4/5It's pretty sturdy too . Great build . Really comfortable . 5/5Noise cancellation is ok ....(I guess) . 3/5Overall I'd say it's a pretty good choice if you are looking to buy a decent bluetooth earphone in this price range . But if you are looking for a good bass ... This is not for you ..... (Bass is pretty good according to my taste ) ."
Pathetic,1.0,"Usually I never give any rating but this time I could not stop myself. After one year of using this headphones, left earphone stopped working.  What do I do with them now? We spent our hard earned money to buy these products and this is what they do to us. I haven't had good experience with boats. Nowadays people are buying their products like anything but all they get is faulty after some time. Now its out lf warranty. I am frustrated but I can't do anything with it. No one would listen me. I lost Rs 1400 on these headphones and also lost Rs 550 on boats 250 because they too stopped working from one side."
Nice product,4.0,"I have been using now since over a month and i found corns in the product its not mine its over all of same model i checked with other too they also noticed the same1 . Noise cancellation is really bad ( its good that you can hear background noise with whom you are talking but sometimes its really annoying )2 . Battery indicator over the phone once phone is connected . It shows 100% initially then after using for few hours it will shows 80% then all of a sudden dead RED3 . Connectivity sometimes i noticed it get auto disconnected and manually i have to connect it back .Quality is really nice , Battery life could be better ,"
Quality Product...Go for ROCKERZ,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Main features have already mentioned on the box....nd it's all more than mentioned...sound quality awesome...battery lyf more than good...nd moreover it luks so stylish ...improves ur personality nd confidence....believe me...the product is so good nd now I'm going to buy this again for my bro....no doubt...value for money nd the quality says itself....üëçüëåüíØ"
Sound is good but not ease to use,2.0,Sound is good and battery battery backup is good but there are Many features missing which will make it a very good earphones1. Switching between calls and music is poor have to pick your phone all the time to choose option2. mic very poor quality it‚Äôs only useful when Surroundings are very calm3. Low battery alert comes just 3-5 minutes before full draining which is not advised for daily commuters4.forget about shortcut keys5. Bluetooth connectivity is good but range not good
Item isn't worth of  ‚Çπ1400.,1.0,"It's been less than 40 days that I'm using this and to be home this is not something you should go for, complete waste of money.- it never gets fully charged- only gives a backup of 6 hours while listening songs on mid volume- once the battery low alert starts it jusr shuts down within 2 more mins of play- cheaply made and has no strong wire that connects the two ear phones or earbuds and can be bend with the flow of air.- If not used for 2-3 hours despite of full charge (90%) it goes down to 60%."
Only bass no sound quality,4.0,"Only bass is gr8, yea only this part.If you are a music lover don‚Äôt buy it.there is nothing bad with these but, if you want a clear audio and a overall good experience in terms of music then go for skullcandy or jbl.By the way I brought this for my Mom and she is happy :)"
Amazing product.,5.0,"I like this product. Low cost high features. Than other brand blutooth headphones. Amazing Sound, crystal clear sound. I suggest purchase this Boat product."
Epic experience for Bassheads,5.0,"Never used a boAt product before this one, but boy was i impressed by the quality of this thing....BASS 9/10Mids 9/10highs 8/10Battery performance  9-10 hours on full charge (also has a feature where 10 mins of charge will give you 35mins worth of battery)...BT range 7-10m depending upon obstacles between this and the phonecomfort 8/10 ....(those plasticy(silicone actually) things protruding from the might feel a bit uncomfortable at first)cons: 1) has a irritating indicator for low battery which i presume goes off about 4-5 times....at 10% first then every drop in percentage after 5% will have you hearing ""oops battery is getting low"" or a similar message  2) The charging port is concealed in an awkard way...although its durable but the cover is kinda obtrusive  3) i recommend not using a power/fast/turbo charger (or whatever they call it these days) if you want to see them live longer than a month.....110mAH battery Li-On battery would def not like that [i charge mine using my laptop USB port.....sometimes i have charged it using my phone too 3% drain for a full charge EPIC for travelling]i have used many wired earphones before this so having a comparison between them seems stupid but it does well in competing with the sennheiser cx 180, jbl C200Si and it even outperforms the sony MDR-Ex150ap in terms of sound quality...also getting it around for 1400 seems like the best price ...anything higher and i would save up for sumtin elsetl;dr if this fits your budget then go for it without thinking"
Good earphones with some cons,3.0,"The sound quality is good enough and you will not regret for the sound that you get. Major benefit is the monstrous battery. If you are a moderate user who uses for 4-5 hours daily on average,it will get you as far as for 8 - 10 days without any charging. Conical buds feel a bit uncomfortable in beginning, but you will get accustomed to it in 10 days or so. Sound volume is okay, not very high but works fine in any environment.The only con that i see is the magnet on the buds is not very powerful and many they detach from each other on their own.Neck band is fine but does not fit perfectly on your neck."
Regretting for buying this product,1.0,"Often gets disconnected automatically. Takes much longer time to connect to the device. Poor sound quality. Unclear voice even when you are talking over the LTE network. The microphone is the worst feature in this product. Person on the other side often complains of my voice not being clear or heard. Extremely poor connectivity. Take 2.5 hours to get fully charged instead of 1.5 hours as mentioned on the box. Works for 3.5 hours maximum after fully charged. FALSE advertisement of this product being active of 6 hours of battery life, which is WRONG. I'm now regretting this purchase. These problems were there since the first day but I ignored. I thought, it would improve in next few days but I'm sorry to say, nothing changed. WON'T RECOMMEND."
Very good,5.0,"Very good product am really enjoying it.. can connect to two devices at a time and calls can be taken from both devices by keeping one caller on hold, a feature that I required in a Bluetooth device.. also the ear buds are soft on the ears and fits in very nicely, it's like u don't have anything inside the ears .. very good product"
I want to return not replacement,1.0,I want to return the item and take back my money.It is purely cheating to the customer . Nowhere it is mentioned that only replacement .There is no return available and only replace .Item is too junk and does not hold any charge.
Not good for workout.,2.0,"I bought it to use during my workouts in the gym. And it fails miserably if you are doing exercises with lots of jumping and movement. It falls off very easily. Also, the most irritating feature is if the battery is low it will continuously start poking, battery low message and you can't use it. The build quality is also very mediocre but that's fine with 1000 bucks pricing."
Bang for the buck but richness in bass is compromised.,4.0,"I have both boat wired headsets and sound magic. Both of them have rich bass. I love them totally & am using from past few years.This wireless in-ear headsets doesn't have the richness in bass. May be the quality is compromised somewhere between the wired & wireless.Except for this one drawback, this product is bang for the bucks you pay. It's lightweight, comfortable, long playtime and the offer price of 999 is excellent.If you're okay with decent bass, this is for you.Apparao retail seller is doing a great job regarding offers & return requests."
Product is good... If planning to buy for 5-6 months..,2.0,Bass is quite good for this price range... did hurt if used for very long time at a stretch... Plus had a little connectivity issues sometimes but it's quite negligible... everything was working fine for the first six months... And then one side stopped working... The worst part was that I complained to the customer care and they asked me to courier the defected piece so that they can replace it with a new one... I did as instructed but never recieved the replacement...!! Isse acha to me bhejti hi na... I dragged the defected piece a few more days with just one ear working but that couldn't happen either... Quite disappointing considering the brand and the price I paid for it...
Except battery nothing is reliable and durable in this product,1.0,"I have purchased boat 255 pro+ on dated 25.07.21.Initially every thing was good. But after 10 days voice gets much slower and very difficult to listen in loudy  places like while traveling or even in office too.* Length of wire is to short to reach the ear comfortably. Neck band is so rigid to fold in fist* Noice cancellation:- Notice cancellation is not so good as expected.* Bass quality:- bass is good but even those songs where bass is not required it will put bass into that too which is very bad.* Durability:- As mentioned above my headphone gets malfunctioned in short period ,so not reliable and durable. When I talked to customer service they said it will take 20 days to replace it. Why should we buy it?* Conclusion:- Except battery life nothing is better at this price. I recommend u to buy One plus head phone"
Stopped charging in 3 months - now useless,2.0,"The product is quite nice - the earphones fit nicely and snugly in your ear, the music quality is decent, the noise cancellation is also good..But disturbance on call is a bother - I've had to disconnect Bluetooth and take the call through the phone several times because the static and noise it added to the caller on the other side. And disconnecting Bluetooth improved the call quality markedly. But this in itself isn't the bad thing - i could live with itIt stopped charging in 3 months - and no amount of trying has gotten it to charge.. Don't know what to do with the unit now that it is just sitting there as a piece of dud electronic..Overall, buy if you will use for a short term and moderate quality is acceptable!"
Please don't buy this product,1.0,"Its very disappointing that the product doesn't work properly. Initially I thought the issue was with my phone and now realised that the product has the problem. I have received a malfunctioning headset which keeps getting disconneting every few minutes.  The purpose of buying this was for attending the long office calls, but this doesnt serve the purpose. And the reason for selecting Boat is because, I wanted to buy an Indian brand where I could have easily bought any other popular brands, but this is what I am facing after buying it. I recommend, please do not buy this product and suffer later. Now I have raised a complaint in the Boat website and waiting for their answer."
"Avg product, need lot of improvements",2.0,"Product is just 2 rating, audio quality is avg,  not that great.  dnt mislead with reviews. It avg product. The plastic used for button areas is so cheap. Boat should spend money on quality improvement than advertising n band ambassador payment."
Overall average,3.0,"The product does what the products of the same price range should do!Packaging is better then Boat‚Äôs other cheaper products, build quality and features wise it‚Äôs almost here and there improved.Good if you‚Äôre going to buy your first pair of bluetooth headphones."
Most useful review,1.0,It‚Äôs gonna be a long review!First everything that‚Äôs mentioned in the feature is nonsense. The product is absolute worthless. Used for just 4 months and both side stopped working. Thought it‚Äôs in warranty let‚Äôs get it replaced then I registered a complaint on 27feb2020 no response till 19june then asked customer care who i think is a single person attending calls from his personal phone and turns his phone off according to his mood says please register the complaint again which i did on 22 june and it‚Äôs 25 june. The funny part is i tried to call the customer support guy it rang and what i know next is that his number is again turned off! This happened twice.Fellows please do not but any product from this company until you want get suffered the same as me.
Please dont buy!!!!!,1.0,"Please don't buy this product. Only after using for 1 month earphones had stopped working and got it replaced within 15 days time. Now again I'm facing same issue with the replaced one.Had bought this earphones for jogging especially for jogging purpose however the keys don't work and I'm not sure of these are even sweat proof. Purchased in the month of March'19 now facing a lot of issues as to charging, battery life, Bluetooth connectivity, ear placement."
Best Product under the budget of 1k,4.0,Hey Friends after so much of research bought this product on 21/10/2020 for ‚Çπ899 and writing this review after using it for 24hr.‚úîStarted using this immediate after delivery with 100% charge and still battery remain 80%‚úî Sound quality is good with this dudget‚úî Build quality is justifiable with the price range‚úî Product delivered next day‚úî 10/10 for battery‚úî Green & Black color combination looks coolHonestly am a first time user of Bluetooth headphones so Dnt know about others but experienced Realme Budds it was awsome...But if you are looking for best budget bluetooth neckband this product is highly recommended just go for it...üëçDownloaded some 3D MP3 audios and enjoying it
Its ok,5.0,"Its the same as boat rockerz 255 nothing changed in my opinion bass has improved earcups are not so comfortable it pain in the ear after an hour of usage(my ear is smaller i think) if you are going to buy 255 should choose 255 pro because of fast charging and battery backup, bluetooth connection has been improved with this oneEdit: i am concerned about the battery health its getting bigger and bigger everyday"
Not a good product. Not working with laptop. Not a good fit.,3.0,"I know BOAT is a famous brand but you have to maintain and look after the product quality as well. This is working well with the mobile but not working at all with the laptop. It's range is also very less and limited. Not liking it at all. The fit is also very poor, every time it's just slip and not steady, Tried with all three ear buds but no luck."
Wrost Bluetooth headset read complete review before buying,2.0,This is a very low-grade china product.Battery backup is not enough by this we can listen music for maximum 2hours.Noise cancellation is not working at all.As there is a very cheap quality üé§ used the outgoing voice quality also not good.Also due to very low voice output the remote user unable to listen your voice clearly.Overall regarding listing music it performs just ok and regarding voice call it is not recommended also battery backup not good.
Under this budget best product to get,4.0,In the budget close to 1.5k this the best choice has good noice cancellation the built and finish quality is better than the previous model 255. Also the micprophone is better than the boat airpods. Best prefomance in movive watching and attending meetings but might pain a little whwn u use them for long
"Good sound, bad ear plug holders",3.0,"Everything is very good about this product. Great sound, I love it. However, if I I hadn't lost those ear plugs and their hooks that help u stick them in ur ear I would have given it a 5 star. They gave extra ear plugs but not those hooks that hold on to the crevices of ur ear to help u enjoy the bass. I can't find them separately on Amazon either. It would be great if Boat could include those in the package."
"Product is nice in this price range. Packaging was poor, i got the damaged  main box.",4.0,"Good product in this price range. Using since 1 day. Let's see if it's durable.Sound quality is definitely good. I'm using synthesizer headphones which are counted as one of the best, compared to them, i actually liked these ones at this price range.Definitely go for it.After one month of usage, the audio breaks every few minutes and it's annoying."
Its not worthy to buy.,2.0,"After using the product more than 6 months I am here to write the honest feedback.There two main purpose to use the wireless earphone i.e.- Listening to the music and talking over phone.Firstly, if you want to talk it will not satisfy the person on the other end as it doesn't have the noise cancellation method, moreover it adds more background noise than the phone actually. It will irritate the other end's quite much sometimes unbearable to  Listen.Now second concern- Listening to the music.Being a music lover, undoubtedly saying that is not rich in Bass nor the terrible and other things are perfect. You won't get much better experience either way, you will definitely get an average feelings for it.So, I conclude you could go to another brand for better experience."
Best neckband under 2000Rs,4.0,"If you want a neckband earphone with super high quality sound and bass, this is for you. It's a little heavy, probably because of the weight of the battery. You just need to charge it for 10 minutes and you can use it for 3 days straight, i am telling this with experience. The only drawback of this product along with a little heavy weight is that it's a little difficult to connect with devices unlike oneplus bulletz wireless. It just takes a few extra seconds whereas bulletz wireless is so easy to connect if the devices are paired already. But i am sure this product is absolutely worth the price."
Worst product. Rockers 255 is better than Pro,1.0,"Worst product i have ever seen. Sound quality is too cheap. No noise cancellation and too disturbance while speaking on call. Call voice quality is the big issue. Can't hear  the voice porperly from other side,  tried with many people but same issue persist. Have returned this product twice as in both earphones the issue was same i.e. call sound."
"Not happy with it, earpieces stopped working with bluetooth connectivity issue.",1.0,"I am not satisfied with the service of the company, rest sound quality was good, battery backup was good. One earpiece suddenly stopped working and I raise a complaint. I thought they replace the product but they didn't and send me same product. Now again one same earpiece stopped working and than other one also stopped working. One more problem started that is connectivity issue of bluetooth pairing. Now I booked a complaint again. Let's see what will happen this time. Will let you know about it.Second thing as it's my first time when I returned any product neither I receive any information about handover defected product to courier boy nor that guy told me and I returned all accessories with the unit. But after 21 days when I receive my product back I receive product nothing was with it.That's the overall experience I have with this product and problem came on the 2nd month after using this and now again."
Very avg sound,1.0,"Am basically a diehard fan of Boat brand as I've many bluetooth speakers at home... unfortunately this one gave me the worst music experience... not at all expected from them... very low bass, flat volume and no noise cancellation...poor product"
Awesome Awesome Awsome,5.0,"Guys amazing amazing product by boat. love this from the first go. Dnt read any negative msgs. This price range it's the best u cn get. Just unboxed it. Sound mind blowing. Bass my first priority as I am a bass lover, the bass is more then happy what I expected. Close ur eyes n order it. Connectivity too gud and gets connected within a second,no issues. Blue colour looks better than black. Sound bass wow. Comes 80% charged. Let's see the backup. Will leave a comment on battery backup as well. Amazon delivered it next day. Thts gud. M telling u guys nothing. better then this. Over n out. Bless us all"
Good one to select.,5.0,"There is no issue to buy it. I have purchased another one before one and half year and it is working perfectly till the date. So, I have again purchased it for someone special. There is one small issue with it is that it is captured background noise more while using it for calling, especially when you are driving. Other than that perfect for any kind of use."
"Value for money earphones, if under 1500.",5.0,"This is a good buy. Sits comfortably around the neck, earpiece is good, and feels sturdy.Noise cancellation is surprisingly good at this price range (during phone calls person on the other end hears very less background noise.)Sound quality - good with Android. With iPhone the sound tends to get crackling at high volumes when equaliser is on. No complains on flat sound.Wires are a bit long, but you get used to it after a while.My only issue with this and other BT earphones in this price bracket is with the voice breaking. If I keep my phone in my pocket (jeans) and walk the audio starts to break and I have to reposition the neckband. This has happened quite a number of times. I used to own a Tagg inferno and MiVi thunderbeats, both had this issue and this one too.To summarise, worth buying, if under 1500."
FAKE PRODUCT BY APPARIO RETAIL PRIVATE LTD.,1.0,The product I ordered was Boat Rockerz 255 and it is suppose to be dual tone product as per manufacturer. And this retail is selling fake product by giving original covering and inside the product neckband is not original copy. Because it is not dual tone plus the quality of metal and runner is also not good. So clearly it can be observed.PLEASE BUT DUAL TONE BOAT ROKERZ 255 ONLY SPECIALLY IN BLACL COLOUR IT SHOULD HAVE GREY TONE ALSO.
Best headphone in this price range,5.0,After using it 10 days i am giving my review about Boat Rockers 255..with impressive sound quality and a good battery backup almost 6-7 hours it is a very good Bluetooth headset in this price rannge..i purchased in Rs. 899 super deal..now comes to about noise cancellation so i would say while listening music you will listening nothing surrouning you but while calling if are in noise atmosphere like on road or people loudly speaking surrond you that time other side caller will not able to listen your voice properly otherside it is good product go for it..
Awesome headphones.,5.0,Yet another awesome product from boat.... The sound quality is very nice.... Noise cancellation though is not fully achieved.... But if the music is on....Then no noise could be heard.... Bass quality is upto the mark.... Wireless connectivity is very nice.... The range is also pretty good.... Fits nicely in ur ears.... And doesn't fall down easily... So overall an awesome headphones.Cheers!
Battery life and sound at this rate ..boooom....,5.0,"After using one week, I felt amazing by using this headsetPros:*Light weight*Easy to switch two phones at a time*Sound quality @50% volume is awesome*Battery life is so much improved can last one week@50% volume (daily 5 hours )*Call quality is better and noise cancellation is also goodCons:There is nothing to say about cons but I like to mention few things which I felt could have improved.*After using long hours I can felt some pain in ears*Volume buttons and multifunction is too small to use."
Excellent Bluetooth earphone - boAt rockerz 255 pro plus,5.0,"Overall superb bluetooth earphone headset.Build quality -  Very good.Sound quality - Excellent.Bass range - Very good.Noise Cancellation - Good enough.Battery back up - Awesome / Excellent(Even after 2 - 3 hours played music player,  Youtube videos with 60% to 70% volume Battery percent is 100% shown not Even even dropped to 90%) which is really very nice and fabulous.Overall very good earphone Bluetooth headset for this price range.Overall rating for this headset - 4.8 / 5 rating.Thanks to Amazon for delivered this product on time.

It price is very less during the Amazon sales . I like it very much . Thanks Amazon  for such wonderfully gift üéÅ.  Thus its brand name , tag was awesome and clear sound is Been heard .

Wow! Super cool product. Go for it. üòé,5.0,"I brought this product for myself and I liked the product very much, especially the audio technology, magnetic lock. I never used the product like this before. Super cool sound quality, good bass quality & noise cancelation.Boat rockerz is rocking ü§ò"
Really a good product(Above worth to purchase ),5.0,"These are of really good built quality(premium quality) except rubber holders and provides smooth sound quality and bass(condition is to use proper ear bud) , happy with the purchase as I used some other brand such as JBL,  skullcandy, house of Marley. It is standing with those brands .The bluetooth gets connected very easily, and its almost 1 year even I accidentally damaged one side even now they are working perfectlyhappy with the productPros:Good built qualityGood sound & bassEasy connectivityPerfectly fitsGood for our doorCons:I found it some what uneasy while in use (might be because of gripper I never used )*Note examples I gave for JBL and .... are for sound quality that I really consider at this point of price"
"Not upto the mark, DO NOT BUY",2.0,"Hi guys, i brought it for 1500/-+  with lot of trust for my OnePlus Nord but right now am totally disappointed for folowing reasons:Cons:1. I hear the opposition persons voice as a ROBOTIC Voice even after full charge and strong connectivity2. Bass is not upto the mark(definitley NOT for bass lovers like me)3. Disconnection issuesPros:1. Battery backup is good2. quality is good3. Give you nice information while ON/OFF and disconnects automatically when not in use !!(Hope every other wireless does it though)"
"Good Product, can recommend.",4.0,"Good Product, good audio response, not very tinny and shows stereo capability. Buds fit properly into ear, and the band retains the entire setup firmly on the neck, and does not fall off.Good budget buy, durability is fine, should not have issues for at least 2 yrs.Battery life is not excellent but good enough, maybe around 5hrs continuous usage."
Try this 1,3.0,"This is my third purchase for the same head set I was fully satisfied till I bought the realme Bluetooth headsetsThere are better headphones with better features available in the same price range orRs 300- Rs 400 extra , You get the realme Bluetooth headsets which is way better than Boat Rockers .Trust me it like upgrading from Maruti to BMW"
"""The best affordable wireless earphones""",5.0,I have been using this product for around 7 months and this Boar Rockerz 255 sports earphones are really very good. No technical glitch till now and it's quite comfortable to wear during workouts and exercises. The bass may be comparatively higher so I use equalizer and Dobly atmos present in my smartphone. There are different pairs of ear bud sizes that can fit every person's ears. The battery quality is also really awesome and runs upto 7-8 hours as per my usage. Some vocal sounds may be unidentified because of it's high bass.
Product OK OK,2.0,"After around 6 months of usage what I discovered was my device is a defective one.The issue is with the mic. The person on the other side gets echo and not a clear voice.However, I can vouch for the noise cancellation. It is quite same with all boat rockerz as my friend has also complained the same.Not good noise cancellation - it's actually a noise enhancer."
Battery life us very bad,1.0,"I bought these earphones 3 months ago , after 8 days of purchase one side of earphone broke and it stopped working, as it was in warranty,i registered a complaint and exchanged it ,  then the battery is always low it gets charged in 15-20 min however gets discharged also in 2 hours only so whenever u need to use need to charge it first. So if you are looking for bluetooth earphones my opinion don't go for it, its not worth investing 1000 bugs and still it feels like not having earphones üòÖ"
DONT WASTE UR MONEY BUYING THIS!,2.0,"There r sooo many reviews saying tht this is a good product,highly recommended,etc .But the reality is tht this is an 'AVERAGED QUALITY' product. There r many other companies tht provide much better quality than this. Mine earphones stopped functioning in less than 3 months of usage! And yes it has one year warranty and all but the CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE! It will take almost a month to replace the product(or more if u dont bug them by calling them everyday!!!). I didn't expect this BoAt & I'm very disappointed."
"Worst Warranty Service by boat (& surprisingly Redgear too, they both share the same service portal)",2.0,"BOAT Service Centre takes like forever to replace your defected product under warranty, They will pick up your product and will take a month to 'process your request', you will only be updated of the status until it goes to their service team, after that, you can just forget you ever had a boat earphones, it's actually better that way why waste your time attempting to contact them and constantly worry about the earphones that don't even last 4-5 months. Rather go for Sennheiser or some other trusted brands whose products actually last long and even if somehow the product fails the company will not abandon you with your defected product under warranty."
Headphone Beast.,5.0,Good product in such a great price. I have bought it for 899‚Çπ. I have been using this product from 1 month.1. The sound quality is good with bass.2. Battery live is good almost 8 hours of continuous use.3. Very flexible and no worries during the time of traveling even you go on sleep on your neck it doesn't give any feelings.4. I travel through train every week. When i plug this earplugs  not a bit sound enters from outside.5. Even having a  call is no more problem. You can recieve and deliver your message without any problem.
Decent sound but bad battery life,3.0,"They're a decent pair of Bluetooth earphones, but the battery life is bad (not more than 3 hours total) & the sound quality is so-so. The bass is especially muddy.They fit in the ear & stay in the ear better than I had expected. Bought these for 1500 & they're definitely not worth that price. At ~800-900 I might have given these a 4-star review."
A decent and functional product with sooper bass,4.0,"Mid range is poor. The finer sounds are not extracted.The product is extremely light and u won't feel it's there. This is an awesome feel. Sooper bass and crystal clear pitch. Bluetooth connectivity is remarkable. I received it yesterday and played for 3. 5 hours without and drop in performance. Seems sturdy. Yes, while listening to audio from Gaana, was getting a 3D feel, as if am sitting midst of a concert."
Don't buy ever,1.0,M very very disappointed with this product. I bought this product on 2nd Oct during sale period for my brother to gift him today on bhai duj.. and when I gifted him tHis today they are not working so complete waste of money even now m not able to return them as window is closed on 10th Oct ... seriously just don't buy them it's wastage of money and spoil your surprise too ..so embarrassing for me when my brother tried to use them but they did not start..spoil my surprise too
"Battery life amazing,UNequal volume both buds,light indication problem,very poor noise cancellation.",3.0,"The battery life is amazing, but most of the time left bud has more volume than the right bud and no blue light indication while charging leaving doubt if it is not charging or if it is fully charged and very poor noise cancellation while on call, caller on the other end often complains of background sounds. I tried resetting the headset but it is not resetting.I have ordered for a replacement, hope the replacement product don't have the above mentioned problems."
Review from an Apple fan,4.0,"Connectivity: seamless, connected well with iPhonesound quality: surprisingly well balanced bassFit: really good, and can be used comfortably well during workoutvolume: since its in-ear, not reco for high volumes, due to its tight sitting, NC works quite wellVFM: fro 999, worth the cost, and is quite inexpensive compared to other BT sets"
You can not pair two device at a time,3.0,I have been using this since last 3 months and my review till now is here1) Nice built quality2) Noice cancellation is also good3) Not Much bassISSUES-Company claims it can pair two device at a time but if you do that then you won't be able to use it properly as after every second hou will feel disconnected and again connected.If you receive a call and you are connected with your laptop with sane earphones then after 5 min Bluetooth conection will disconnect automatically.
Please read reviews before a buy.,1.0,Everyone please read before buyIi used this Earphone 3 weeks then i write review.I mentioned step by step what i faceing problem Quality - earphones quality is good..but when you wearing your neck getting irritating after some time...and very long wires..of earphone..Sound quantity- sounds quality is very tribble..No bass and and no extra bass in this ear phone..If u listen song half an hour getting irritating... because of sound...After that..when you talking through this Earphone.background noise is very high.When you talk to another person they will not listening your voice properly...bcz of noise issue in this earphoe ..Charging - charging time 2hrs for full.charge..And back alos if you using continue 2 hrs only backup time...So please don't buy this earphone...Don't go for this ear phone..Better opstion available in any brand like jbl/ sony.
Boat hurts!üòë,2.0,Bass is too much. Hurts your ear sometimes.. The quality of audio is below average.Trust me.. Go for Oneplus Bullets Z instead.
They sound good really good. Lag is really bad and connection is spotty. Don‚Äôt recommend it,3.0,"Connection issues is my main problem. Phone is in pocket and sound breaks up. And lag is awful in PUBG you stop walking and sound is like good second or two behind. Amazing sound quality for price. Comfortable built quality is not bad. That‚Äôs why I gave 3 stars. I am going to use it for music mainly so I am keeping it, but if you are planning to use it for gaming don‚Äôt but it. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this. If you are using it for anything but music."
Stopped working after 20 days.,1.0,"The product stopped working after 20 days of usage. 1st symtom, bluetooth (earphone)  is getting disconnected from phone automatically. 2nd symptom the earphone gets power off automatically after around 30 minutes of usage. Final symptom, power is not turning on. Really dissapointed with boAt and Amazon."
Durable,5.0,"I've been using this headset for the past 7-8 months and the following is my review.Pros:durable,feels premium,good bluetooth connectivity,fair stereo quality,bass is acceptable,stylish,magnetic attachment looks coolCons:battery life ~ 3 hrs on continuous usage,mild uncomfortable after putting on for 1-2 hours,earhooks doesn't fit properly - always come out,noise cancellation is just ok.microphone doesn't catch sound properly while on call"
"Not durable, but worth it",4.0,"Lasted exactly as long as the warranty period, stopped working the very next day. But while if worked, it was the best. Great quality, waterproof, I used it at work and at home. UNBELIEVABLE battery life, plus you can use the product even when it's charging. No other Bluetooth headset I know of has that feature."
üëåüëå superb üëåüëå,5.0,"This headphone is really awesome üëåIt's bass is also too good , even it's battery backup is so good , I'm satisfied with this product in this range ,,,,Guy's I recommend you to buy thisBcoz I have used many electronic product of this company and  the boAt company never disappoint me ,,,,,So you should try this at least one time üòä‚ù§Ô∏èThank you Amazon ‚ù§Ô∏è"
A decent Earphone for this price range.,4.0,"I am satisfied with the product. For this price, it is indeed one of the best bluetooth earphones. Uptill now I didn't experience any malfunctioning. Battery backup is decent(If your usage is longer than 4 hours I won't recommend these). It has a pretty good sound quality and bass quality. Noise cancellation is also fine. A pretty decent match for a student and moderate user. My rating 4.1 out of 5. Drawbacks:The earphones cannot cannot easily fit inside your pocket due to their structure and are not that handyBattery backup.Regardless the drawbacks,if you have a low budget and want great performance, I will highly recommend these!‚úå‚úå"
üòäTHE BEST product choice I've made so farüëåüèª,5.0,"If you are planning to take this piece then you are making a correct decision.(Every one has different opinion about electronics because first, they've huge expectations and second, every body gets different piece delivered and unfortunately sometimes technical issues can happen and it's natural. So if any issue you can always exchange it.Anyways, following is my feedback that can be of your help while buying this product.)Since I've purchased it, I've come across only positive things. No complaints.1. Sound quality: amazing2. Battery life: sufficient. 5-6 hours at a stretch3. Bluetooth connectivity : within seconds.4. Calling : I've faced no lagging. Smooth.5. Noice cancellation : yes, little parcial. In short if anybody is talking about you in front of you, you won't be able to hear them unless you lower the volume or remove the ear piece.üòÖ6. Value for money : definitely. I can only say, it's like you're getting a car in price of a bike.Good battery backup, doesn't stop working, product quality is good, price range is so affordable, this particular model is good, designed lightweight, worth the money invested.PS. It's not been too long that I've used this product, but as time passes, I'd review it again."
Loved it,5.0,"Good battery backup. As my ears are wider, usually any ear phone will not stay fit in my ears :) But this one is awesome. I use it for my daily calls, list to music and videos. Excellent sound quality and it is the best for this price. Yet to see the durability aspect but i think boat products are good on that aspect. I will suggest this product to all"
I am happy with the support service of boat,4.0,"I had purchased a set on 11th of oct and found that after use the product is defective and not charging properly. The product get automatically turn off/on continuously while charging. So I had initiated online complain on boat cust support service on 26th oct and the very next day they had arrange the pickup of the faulty product and inspect the product properly, On 30th of oct they had initiated replacement of the product and dispatch the same without any hurdles calls. On today I got the replacement and is working perfectly fine.Thanks Boat for the after sales services...!Go ahead with the brand."
Product is good,3.0,Product from the seller - goodDelivey by Amazon - awesomeBut if you don't want to get stuck with boat services just look for another option please... I bet even the Chinese companies will repair/replace your item faster than them. It's been 25 days since my product picked up and still they can't tell me exactly what's going on. It didn't get updated after the first 4 days. I'm now even losing hope to get it back seriously. Worst Servive Boat Community... Worst ever
Great Bluetooth Headphones for Rs. 899,4.0,"I bought it for Rs. 899 and at this price range, I don't think I'll see a better alternative.Sound quality is a solid 4 out of 5. The sounds are nice and clean. The bass has a distinct punch to it. The noise cancellation is also great.The Bluetooth connects almost instantly and its range is about 25 feet on average (with walls and obstacles in between).The battery life is great too. It lasts almost am entire day with intermittent use.If you are getting this for under 1000 rupees, go ahead. I highly recommend buying this."
Original Review after using one month.,5.0,Looks very beautiful. Sound quality is good. Fits best in ears. Noise cancellation is upto the mark. Battery backup is also at satisfactory level. I'm using it since last month. Feeling some easiness with this. Inward/outward calls control is super. One drawback is that at long run it creates pain in ears. Hope Makers should improve it. All over it is a good product üòä.
"Do not buy, headphone fails after 3 to 4 months",1.0,"Do not buy, Headphone fails after 3 to 4 months. Normally the left side speaker fails.  This happened to be 3 different times.  All the three worked to 3 to 6 months and then failed.  Waste of money.  now  I am trying Sony and Realme bluetooth headphone.  2 months now, both are working fine."
Good but not the best!,4.0,"I bought this after searching many Bluetooth wireless earphones.Here is my review after using this product for one week with my OnePlus 6T.Pros-Battery life is good compared to other earphones.-Bass is good-Light weight even u can't feel it's around your neck-Noice cancellation is awesomeCons-Faced some issues in connectivity when mobile is in my trouser pockets(When holding mobile in hand,no issues at all)-Running with mobile in trousers also shows some interruption in hearing-Sometimes I hear unwanted noice (I think there is compatibility issues with OnePlus 6T and other devices too)-Battery charge is always showing 100% in 6T-Bass is good but I feel too noisy-The voice on connection and disconnection is weirdIf you are looking for wireless earphones under 1500,it is the best among the all! You can't get all the best features in this price range. So go for it!"
Amazing product.,5.0,"Sound quality is extremely good.Light weight and fits in comfortably in the ears.Bass quality is perfect. Very handy effective item when you are traveling with luggage.Worth the money, I bought it at 999/- on Amazon sale."
Stay away from boat.,1.0,"Absolutely inferior earphones. Boat couldn't provide sound quality, so, they provided an irritating bass so, you wouldn't notice the bad sound. I returned these and bought the OnePlus bullets wireless z instead. They are much better. If you want your ears to survive please buy a sony or Sennheiser or something. Stay away from boat."
Average quality product,1.0,"Recieved the product in good condition but box looked like local. Build quality average, sound quality is good at this price, battery backup is good working for 4 hrs aprox, Bluetooth was connecting good for first 15-20 days, now there is some connectivity issue too.  service is not good, mailed several times to register for warranty, not registering the product for warranty at first now recieved revert maill after 4-5 days for complain numbers not yet confirmed the registration, toll free number doesn't connects. Used this product for more than 30 days. Not fully satisfied. Its an average quality product. So if you want good service and good product and if you can Spend some more money then get a branded trusted product than this one."
Good product but not compatible with google duo video calling,3.0,"After 2-3 month research i bought this product. i m using iphone 7 .... the voice is clear, base is good but it gives beep frequency while listening music which is very irritating. not having same problem with other device. Otherwise its a good product ..... battery life is Ok....NOT COMPLETABLE with Google Duos video calling"
Perfect for music,4.0,"The product design is really good, comfortable, lightweight. The color combination is perfect for the unisex collection. I picked a red and black combination. The noise cancellation for the call is good but not up to the mark. The biggest drawback I felt was I could not connect to my laptop via Bluetooth plus you cannot take calls from the headset. the buttons are to control the volume and play and pause the call."
Great build quality but sound is average not so much noice cancellation,5.0,Build quality is great but low latancy/music in kow volume is bad compare to my other oneplus bullet z wireless is has low quality in music but + point for gamers it has great latency in gaming so u can easily enjoy game and main point i bought 255pro+ in 1100/h so if u find that deal on top model means 255pro+ just buy it or if u have 2k budget go for oneplus dont think anymore for other nechband or earbuds
After sale Service Quality is very poor,1.0,"Very Poor service quality from BOAT. BOAT says that the warranty period is  of one year. But in my case the earphone stopped turning ON, even being in warranty period and it has been more than a month of registering the complaint ,and it was promised by BOAT that courier partner shall pick up the earphone but yet no pick up for repair or replacement has been arranged by BOAT.even there isn't any response from customer care on my multiple complaints in this regard.so in nutshell a bad choice to go for BOAT."
Amazing sound quality. value for money.,5.0,"boAt Rockerz 255 Sports Wireless Headset is a great headset.I had bought it for my morning walks and I love listening to music and Boat Rockerz  255 is the best at sound quality, noise cancelling and very good bass effect, keeps you motivated for the extra run.it is value for money. Wireless with very good battery life. best in this price range."
Good product but not really for runners,3.0,It's a good product in itself with good audio etc. The issue for me is that I was looking for something that is good to run with and unfortunately the part that goes over your neck just jumps up and down when you run and it's quite annoying. This product is better suited for walkers. Even though sound is good I will buy another product instead which doesn't have the stiff heavy neck part but is just a cable.
Value for money. Endless battery,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I have already used the basic version of this product which is rockerz 255. I was happy that it lasted for around a year, so ordered the Pro+ version for better battery back up.And yes... The battery backup is seriously long lasting.I have used this neck band for binge watching for straight two and half days and it still had 40% juice left.Sound Quality is very good. Bass quality on highest volume isn't THE BEST. However, it won't matter as we hardly go that high on volume.The ear wings fit to the ear perfectly. (ears might hurt initially if you haven't used such earphones with the wings before. But, that's just a matter of day or two.)The built is sterdy for the price and I have no complaints.The magnets aren't the strongest in the world. But, sufficient enough to hold the earpieces together."
After 1.5 year of usage. 5star to 3 star rating.,3.0,Cons: Lost sound on one ear bud after 8 months. 4 no after that the other one died. Now it just works as a Bluetooth receiver!!!Life Span: 1 year. If your looking for a long lasting one better spent 3k and go for Sony xb wireless or Samsung level u.Pros: Bass as promised. Water resistant as promised. If you're looking for a Bluetooth headset below 1000 go for it.Can be used for sports activities as it sticks on the ear with the ear bud design.Good for sport lovers.
Totally bassy!ü§òüî•,5.0,Noise cancellation is good...Bass quality is amazing...Sound quality is okay...Because of bass...even sufi or silent songs would sound bassy which I did not like.Taking calls is what I enjoyed the most...even while walking by a busy road our voice clearly reaches the other side and vice versa.
Don't buy,2.0,"Overall the experience was sort of okayish till first 3 months. After that one side of the earphone started having problem. Sound is very uneven. One side the volume is high and the other side, volume is quite low compared to first side. This just spoils the mood. Also there is a great lag in sound. This might be due to Bluetooth again."
Good Product... Rating - 3.8 / 5.0,3.0,"The media could not be loaded.

Don't buy plz read it before buying,2.0,"Cons: stopped working one side in w-3 months, filed complaint to boat, the picked my product, after 15 days i got new pair from them, after using it, one side stopped working after 2-3 months, now I again sent it to the boat service centre it's been 3-4 days, iam sure when will provide me new one, but the thing is that these headphones are not reliable for long term ohh sorry not even for short term use, iam thinking what if the new one also stops working after the warranty expires. And it also have poor connectivity , from front pant pocket to neck it gets voice break . Not worth the money go for jbl my cousin is using he had no issue. One of my frnd has also the same problem and his frnd also has the same problem ""one side not working"" And their homes are out of town to get boat replacement warranty. They jus used for couple of month 3-4 months max.. Very disappointed from boat especially from this product.. üòûüòî it has very good bass noice cancellation, poor battery 100 to 60 3-4 hours and 60-0 in 10 mins üòÇüòÇüòÇ , this battery problem is facing everyone all of my frnd. Tooks some time to charge. Not worth the money, go for any other product. At least don't buy this variant from boat."
Good purchase under 900,5.0,It's being 4 5 days and they r working perfectly I really like the product I would love the product if it works perfectly for 5 6 months cause it only cost 900 and it's not airpods offcourseNice catchy designGood bluetooth connectivityEasy to handleYou can't take it out if you are going to walk and not going to listen to songs you maybe not get what I m saying of you don't just ignore this pointA good buy
"Worst product, first day bluetooth not connected with Mobile",1.0,"I have received this wireless boat bluetooth today 06.09.2021. but it's not working, even I searched 100 times but bluetooth not showing in my and my friend mobile and laptop. Never purchase it in life. Keval loot macha rakhi hai. On boat name doing fraud only, delever cheap product only. This is wireless bluetooth but it not working/showing. What is this bhai???ghatiya product ke liye Negative review ka option bhi hona chahiye."
Wrong information provided by company no aptx codec support and no low latency.,3.0,"It does not support aptx codec it only works on aac and sbc codec .Bass is good , sound quality is also good .There is latency when you press the pause ‚è∏Ô∏è button the music üéµ stops after 3 second.When the music stops and hissing sound comes it becomes very annoying .One should think thoroughly before buying it."
Headset problem,3.0,"Bought Boat rockerz 255 in April 2019.Initially the product was good.However the right handside earphone is not working now and not sure if this will be covered in my warranty.Have tried all possible ways to rectify but in vain.Doubting the quality of such a simple product which is not durable.Raised a complaint once the right ear phones were not working. After 3 weeks the same was serviced ( faulty product picked up, serviced and delivered).But the problem surfaced again after 3 months. Right ear phone not working again.Looks like they have compromised on the quality of something basic. Thumbs down to Boat Rockerz üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº"
Satisfactory sound quality with low battery life,3.0,"The battery life is remarkably low. I cannot blame the seller as it was said to be 6 hours, but my experience is 4-5 hours when I connect it to both my laptop and phone.Usually a good connection and switching between devices, but often my phone used to stop recognizing it when I just finish a call on my laptop."
after 3 month of usage = Worth in this price,5.0,"I am writing this review after almost 3 months of usage, and I can say almost daily usage in this time period. sound quality is damn good, as well noise cancellation is also good [you can't hear your family members shouting, while just putting this in ear ;-) ]. charging lasts 2-3 days, but that's enough with very tiny battery in this much compact setup.only thing I feel as drawback is that the rubber ring they give in ear-piece to fix it into our ear is getting loosened with time. but that's OK with other positive points.over all I would like to give 4.5/5 stars.good to go with it."
Super se upper,5.0,1) I have purchased this on 13/10/21. From that day to 22 nd October I have used it randomly but till now 40% battery backup which is amazing.2) Noise quality is good3) But it's magnet  quality is not good as like my previous boat rockerz 255 pro.4) It's Volume bottom is not in perfect order (+&-). I think it's wrong.5) connectivity is good.Over all if you think to buy this product then your money not waste. As a common man I advise to go  for it. üôè
Nice Bluetooth earphone,5.0,I was using boat 255 then I upgraded to Boat 255 pro. It has good battery and latest bluetooth version. I use it to connect with my mobile and laptop. I bought during sale and got the red color but I dont like the red color (red color was the only color available at 1099/-. Apart from red color other colors are good. Choice is urs but working perfect . Sound / Battery / connectivity is good.
Good but consider other products...,2.0,"The build quality is good... But not top notch... I was using flipkart smartbuy bluetooth earlier... It was way better in half price but its only downside was thin wire and average build quality... The sound is FLAT there is literally no bass... As mentioned, it charges to full in just 10-15 min... Calling quality is great. No glitches... The welcome sound ""connected"" , ""ready to pair"" are too loud... It sends shockwave in brain... The overall quality is good for sport use"
Bad product and brand,1.0,"Headphone's sound quality was fine. But it stopped charging In April that's just after 5 months into the use. I couldn't replace it due to lockdown. Now I have sent it for manufacturer's warranty. It took 12 days to reach service center( Aurangabad to Mumbai it's hardly 320 km), now it has been 4 days, its lying in service center with no update. You guys deserve 0 stars. If I dont get any update in next 2-3 days I'm going to consumer forum. Bad product and service. Don't use it."
Real value for money,5.0,These are the first wireless earphones I'm using after using normal earphones for several years. I'm extremely impressed with the sound quality and also how comfortable they are even if you are someone like me who listens to podcasts or music for several hours at a stretch. I had to change the earbuds to the smallest size from the standard size that are part of the package. Bluetooth connectivity is great since I've used them with my mobile as well as TV and PC (using a transmitter) and never faced any issues or disturbance. Battery life is also pretty good around 5-6 hours and charging barely takes an hour. The sound is crystal clear and for the price its available at it is real value for money.
Awesome product,5.0,"Been using this for a year now and it's very good in terms of sound quality,bass and noise cancellation and battery back up...I use it for gym workout so once charged lasts for about  5 to 6 hours...Fits well in my ears .however it depends on your inner ear shape, as the same was not holding in place  when my girlfriend used it . It does not fall while doing my skippings or my jumpings...it's dangerous to use this product outdoors for running or while driving as the outside noise is totally cut."
Bluetooth Earphones with superbb Noise Cancellation,5.0,Bought this from amazon prime sell @ Rs.999/- only.Super Bass with high quality sound and awesome noise cancellation.Near about 5 hrs battery backup after charging once.Calling is awesome.......but one has to be in a low noisy place while calling because if the place is noisy then the other side will get those noise more than your voice.Bluetooth range is also good without lagging.All over it is good to use in a low cost.
Super long battery backup Bluetooth earphones,5.0,"After using 1 month, I can say it's worth buying . I am using it with laptop, Mobile and Tablet with dual pairing functionality. It's very useful for attending office meetings from laptop using Boat Rockerz 255 Pro+ neckband earphones. Single charging lasts for 1 week approx with daily heavy usages of 5-6 hour for calls, Videos, musics. Call quality is superb. Noise cancellation not good with laptop but ok will phone. Helpful for Work from home works who attends many meetings over laptop and Cellphone."
"Great for music, atrocious for phone calls, just not worth the price",1.0,"It is very good for listening to music and podcasts and provides good sound quality. If you are travelling on a two wheeler, the mobile has to be kept on your side pockets or your shirt pocket. If you keep it in your back pocket, the sound will keep breaking.The earphones are however absolutely horrible for phonecalls and just not built for that purpose. 60-70% of the time, either you cannot hear the other party or they won't be able to hear you."
The best battery life and high audio quality.,5.0,"The best thing about these earphones is its high quality at such a reasonable pricing. They have a good bass which allows you to have a good experience with music. The only thing which can be a bit irritating is the conical buds. But since you can remove those, there's no issue. The battery is amazing. You can go for about 4 days with one full charge and an extensive usage. Overall, it is a must buy for people who are looking for pocket friendly wireless earphones which also adds to their style statement. I am giving it 5 stars. Would surely love to see what they would offer in the future."
Excellent overall headphones,5.0,"This is an excellent product from boatrockers. The sound quality of these headphones is very good, much better than those of the original oem‚Äôs. There is no dropping of Bluetooth connection, although the range is pretty less than the high end headphones. the battery life is as stated, the charge in my headphone lasts for a whole week with my usage. It is noise isolating headphone. The only real issue that I find is that you cannot skip to the next track with them. The controls need a bit of an upgrade. I would recommend this headphones to anyone looking for decent audio experience at very reasonable price."
"Dont Buy This Product, last for just 4-5 months and customer service BAKBAS",3.0,"I dont recommend u to buy this product. My reviews are 100% helpful as I purchased the product last year.Good things:1. On sale, u will get this product for 999/-2. The sound is good, base is good with this price range3. Bluetooth is perfect4. Battery backup is almost 3 hoursBut why I am not recommending u to buy this, here are reasons1. Its durability is just 4 to 5 months. After 4 to 5 months one or both side earphone stop working2. It holds 1 year warranty but if u want to claim ur warranty, it is tedious process. They pick up ur headphone,  but they didnt give it back within 1 month. They take more than a month to give back ur headphone. Furthermore, U need to call them a number of time for getting ur product back. Also, they are very rude to talk with us. They  give u the product back only if u call them again and again, if not forget about the headphone.Personal experience:My one side speaker stop working after 5 months, then i request them for a warranty. They collect my headphone, but they took abot 1.5 months to return and this is even when I call them again and again. When I got the new headphone, they again last for just 3 months and now they are not working. Me and my friend ordered this product, my friend's headphone last for 6 months and then stop working, he claimed for the warranty  but so far he didnt get the product back even after 4 to 5 months, they are not picking up the phone"
finally found something real good,5.0,"i have special needs. my ears are big. normal headsets won't fit in my ear. over the ear headsets also hurts my ear coz i wear spectacles. if u hav same issues, then Boat Rockerz is the right device u sud buy... thank u Boat Rockerz. (edit-writing after 10 months of usage.really working good)"
"Got it during some offer so price was around 999, was worth at that",4.0,"Overall product is great. Sound quality generally exceeds expectations. Snug fit in the ear.Can connect to two devices.This aside some things to look out for:1. The ear pieces have those appendages which are supposed to help them rest in the ear, they tend to become loose and slide off.2. Range is slightly limited and the quality drops are noticeable.Cons:Battery life is an issue, though something that is part of the product description, so well. Think about alternatives or charging options when you travel.Mike performance could be a downer."
Best model of boat headphones.,4.0,"I bought it on 17 oct 2021 &  the charging was full. Till now I have watched 4 movies with this earphone.  And also every day I listen to songs for 2 to 3 hours. Still till date(29.10.21) my charge is 35%.  In my opinion, there is no better headphone than this. I will give rating for this head phone1- Battery backup-  5 star2- Bass quality- 5 star3- Design-  4 star4- Noise Cancellation- 5 star5- Ear cushions- 3 star6- Price range-  4 star"
Descent sound quality but tampered packing,3.0,"First of all I was pretty pissed off with the kind of packaging that I received. It was tampered. So I exchanged it, but again got the same packet, with the same s.no. Seems like there was nothing wrong with the earphones. But still I was expecting a brand new packing and products. Hope Amazon would look into it.Coming to the earphones,I have used multiple products including JBL, air pod, sennheiser and now this. Sound quality is great, and noise cancellation is also fine to an extent. But its bass is not so great. It doesn't give the kind of bass and boom that you get in sennheiser. Also, the Bluetooth range seems pretty low. When I moved from one room to another there was a minor disconnect in the music and then it resumed.My verdict: If you are getting it on discount price only then go for it. Otherwise you can get better earphones in such range ( not Bluetooth ones)"
Great Value for the Price Range,3.0,"Great value for the money. Almost all reviewers said that they found 'Hisss' sound defect, but I couldn't find any on my device, I guess depends of device to device. Only issue I found is not able to trace the exact battery remaining percentage (in numbers) on my Xiaomi phone.Pros1. Good connectivity2. Good bass3. Battery is fantastic4. Light weight5. Dual pairing6. Call quality is betterCons1. PUBG low latency could have been much better.2. Sound quality should have been made better on equalising bass, treble, vocals.3. Magnetic play pause option missing.4. Built quality is average.5. No app support for additional tweaks (realme link app)6. ANC should have been included."
Nice product!,4.0,"The sound quality of this product is nice, bass also quite good. The color is also sporty. The only concern is its battery backup, although the product delivers the backup as claimed by the company of 6 hrs,yet is comparatively low and also irritating. Subject to that the product is really great. Connectivity is also pretty good. Comfort wise also the product is really good. Overall it's a great product.However the delivery by Amazon could be improved a bit.!"
Hissing sound when no audio is playing... don't buy,3.0,battery life is superb. sound quality average.build quality is good but it's little heavy compared to other bluetooth headset.only downside is  hissing noise which comes when no audio is playing.if I had known this issue before buying it I would have not bought it.l
Good built and performance for its price,4.0,"I have received the product just yesterday and this feedback is based on one day usage. For this price point, it is a well-performing device. Earpieces fit well in the ear. One and half hours of continuous use did not cause pain. Build quality seems fine and wires are sturdy. Buttons are tactile enough and easy to operate. Connectivity seems fine. Voice through mic is also okay.Pros:Good Bass.Build quality quite satisfactory.Loud enough sound.Lightweight and comfortable for prolonged use.Cons:Magnet seemed weak. Earpieces fell apart twice in one day.Mid-tones are on a lower side. Treble OK. All emphasis is given on building bass."
Just Awesome,5.0,"Just awesome in quality.Battery life is very good.Connectivity is very good with multiple device.I attend several meetings with different devices one after other.Very useful for multi device operators as well.I did meeting for my research, for my startup and other as well. So it is very handy for me.Build quality is very good and perfectly fit with my ear.I am satisfied and strongly recommend it for purchase."
"Manufacturing defect, No quality check?! ""Avg earphones""",2.0,"Manufacturing defect in charging cable.No quality check in BoAt I believe.Earphones looks average.Sound quality average.Slips out of ear every now and then.The extra horn given doesn't fits in ear properly.Pain in ear after using for a while.Cable quality looks OK, will come ro know about durability only after using for long time.Can only be connected to one device (Bluetooth veraion 4.0)Dont get fooled by graphical images with Bollywood models. The real looks are totally different than the graphical images.An average earphone at budget to have the feeling of owning a blootooth earphones."
Worst sound quality,2.0,If you are looking for good sound quality then this is not the right choice.No bass sound.Can't even use for more than 30 mins. Ears are paining.Earphone wire also not good quality.Only one highlight from my point of view is battery.If you charge it for 1-1.5 hrs then it will come for more than 10 hours of continuous use.But you can't keep it in your ears for more than 15 mins.
I am using this since 4 day some time create problem. I feel cheet just like flipcard.... üëéüò¨‚òπÔ∏è,2.0,"I am using this since 4 day hear some time create problem. For example ""I used it 3 hours continuously then ear phone show 40 % battery but it was not working... I changed it after 15 min its battery show 80% again I use wish my Samsung galaxy phone within 5 min battery show 40%. So I don't recommend it. I feel cheet just like flipcard"".... üëéüò¨‚òπÔ∏è"
only buy if your are a base lover(read below for cons),3.0,the headsets are comfy and the design is sleek regarding sound the headsets handels most of the back gound instruments just fine not great just fine the base is so much that it interferes with the voice of the vocalist the sounds gets suppressed while the base is just loud the voice also cracks sometimes if you listen closely overall not for everyone but great buy.Edit this one con is bugging me after a month n half of usage i have been travelling in local train in mumbai for almost 4 years and this is not for those who travel in the morning in rush hours there are bunch of people sourrended you in the meanwhile the earphone stops working the voice starts to crackle and the earphone gets disconnected this happens daily in rush hours this irritates me a lot and another thing is battery jumps from 60 to 20 percent where is 40 percent and battery backup is max 4 hours n half min 4 hours
Good product but value for money depends on offer,4.0,"I am the first time boat user. Compared to jbl bass is better but the clarity and voice punch is not that great. Giving full volume bass is ok but the sound turned to become distored and noisy, not that great experience in high volume. According to the price from other headphones it is value for money but the price is very high without offer but with offer it becomes value for money."
Good support by Amazon. Bad product.,2.0,"I expected this product to be excellent. Two of my colleagues use the same model and have good things to say about it. So when I saw this product on a great discounted price I bought it at once.But unfortunately my experience was no where as good. It started well. Sound quality was okay for me as I am not an audiophile. But mic failed in 5 days.Raised a replacement request. Received one in less than 48 hours. Great. But this one didn't even run for 2 days. It started with a Bluetooth connection troube with my phone. Connected finally after charging for some time and then few restart of the earphone. Then the next day it started disconnecting and shutting down automatically. When I switch it on again, it's at 100% battery. And the next day, it refused to start at all. Had to return the product.Thanks to Amazon for handling the return well. May be it was just my bad luck. But I won't recommend this to anyone."
Sound quality is good. But waste as the wireless connectivity function not working properly.,1.0,"While wifi is connected, making video call over WhatsApp showing ""poor connection . Video paused"" error and frequently this happens. I bought this wireless headset mainly for video calling.. Since it is creating the problem, my rating is a big zero. I recommend any other branded affordable headsets instead of this"
microphones are bad,2.0,well the earphones are fine per say audio was good enough bass is kinda excessive to some level its not nicely balanced...the good part is the battery life ....why i am giving this such low rating is because of mic....its microphone is utter trash and even placed in a non convenient place ....the microphone doesn't work at all properly if the fan is on or there is even a little background noise ....you have to scream in a silent room to just have these to read your words correctly and that's kinda a deal breaker if you wanna be on calls at times speak in online meeting sessions or anything at all...
Use it for regular life,3.0,Im giving my honest review after using it about 2 days i have used it 6-7 hours a day and if u r thinking that this device will give u any type of battery issue u r wrong but there a issue with this device if u connect it with 2 device at a time one device will give u best sound quality but with other the sound will from somewhere from video or movie u r playing like in my case i used it with my tv but when i use it with my phone at same time it will have this issue than i have to restart it....On the other hand the sound quality is best in this price range and its a value product from my side.
Honest review used after 1 month,1.0,No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining for voice.6. Problem in connect with hotspot if connected with boat
Product is too fragile. It did not last more than a 3 ~ 4 Months,1.0,The product is fragile. One ear stopped working after 3 ~ 4 months of use. Their support is useless. Raised a ticket and they picked up the product 2 months ago. Website says Replacement was issued and dispatched. BUT THERE IS NO TRACKING NUMBER. NO CLUE WHERE THE HELL REPLACEMENT IS..They don't respond to any mails and they don't respond to any phone calls.
Fantastic in the price range,5.0,"Best bluetooth headfones in the price range. i bought it under lightning deal @ 999/- However, I would have even paid the full MRP for this one. Everything namely connectivity, sound quality, noice cancellation, built quality, sweat resistance, responsiveness to the buttons, etc.. is awesome about these headphones. You cannot have the same qualities in any other brand in this price range."
Average headphone in this range,3.0,"I have purchased headphones from Amazon and as written it has a 10mm driver and good chipset but this boat rockerz 255 pro+ sound quality is not good. I am using Oppo A57 it disconnects when I called, which may be due to the OS of my phone.Though the sound quality I have compared with my other wireless and wired headphone even cheaper than it but the sound was not comparable with that 2 headphones. The sound I don't like they need improvement. And another information that only replacement of the headphone is possible on electronic goog so be careful when purchasing the electronic items online. Also, voice during a talk to anyone was not smooth, it's annoying you. Thanks Amazon learn a lesson....."
Excellent,5.0,"I was sceptical about the product when I ordered it , that's being honest. I had come across it several times earlier when I had bought my previous headphones. This time thanks to Amazon product placement, it was in my face and going by the description and certain reviews, I made the choice trusting Amazon and Leaf. They both lived up to their word and I am satisfied with my headphones. Had it charged and used it to find that the sound quality and clearity is very good through my phone. More than what I was expecting and I am sure it will sound better once I test it through my pc and music system where I can adjust the quality through a equalizer and amp. Overall a great product, great for my phone. Sure recommend it to all and the price is good too."
It is a great deal to get your hands on,5.0,"Well, I have been using these for a month now and the earphones are really good. The sound quality is immensely saturated. The bass is good for people who are not audiophiles. Like if you're not into sound recording or need minute details to grab onto, its perfect for you. Mic quality is kinda okay clear but it catches too much of sounds around you which can irritate the person on the other line. But on an average a great deal to get your hands on."
Disappointing product,1.0,"I'm writing this review after few days of usage.Pros:-Sound quality is good, bass is okay okay, overall good.Cons:-Keeps disconnecting and connecting in between, voice gets distorted as soon as i go outside or at terrace even when i place my phone behind me music gets distorted. So u cannot use this in open space as sound breaks everytime.I bought it twice, and returning it because of this problem. It sucks"
Quality of product is too good,4.0,"Boat is the best electronic company  only not in India, in the world also. It gives quality in the product. This earphones are very good . It's sound quality , battery life, is very good , wide and strong wires will protect earphones from damage. I will recommend everyone to buy this"
Terrible product,1.0,"The product is terrible.. bluetooth connectivity with phone is horrible, so can't use for calls. normal usage for music etc is okayish. The charging wire provided stopped functioning after 3/4 days. Sound quality is reasonable, it does have decent bass when it works, which is rare. When connecting to laptop or tab, one ear sound is louder but this doesn't happen on mobile. This is the second time I brought boat rockers and both products were terrible. I only bought it bcoz of lockdown and this was the only product Amazon was delivering quickly. Now I regret doing so. No headphone is better than this product."
Bluetooth disconnects and connects again and again,1.0,The connection is not stable. Keeps disconnecting even if I am using with my laptop or my phone in hand. And the voice announcement for connection or disconnection is so loud that it really is annoying. I have almost stopped using this bluetooth and my money is literally wasted.
Great wireless earphones,5.0,"Have been using them since 6 months now. Got it for my wife but ended up using them most of the time. Great sound quality and connectivity with Android, Mac and Windows. Sturdy to use. Good battery life. Mic is also good while speaking on phone and on calls. People hear me well while using the mic."
I'm using this for the past 6 months. Here is my opinion on this product.,4.0,"I'm using this for the past 6 months. This headset is overall nice.What I like:1) Sound quality is good.2) Bass is good.3) Good in looks.4) light weight.5) It is a nice one in this price range. (I bought it for 1499rs and now the price is just 999rs).But there are some things I didn't like.They are:1) Mike is very bad. The person to whoom I am talking with, always complains about the noise. Even small sounds from the surroundings feels iritating to the person on the other side.2) Battery is not bad. But, when it has become 60%, it suddenly starts falling to 0%.3) At few times, I had connectivity issues.Overall, Ignoring these problems, this one is a nice buy."
"For 999, This is a good deal",3.0,This earphones are recommended when they are available under Rs999. They dont stay in my ear when i go running as the weight of the band pulls it down. I recommend Boat 261 or Chkokko M2. If you want to use it while walking or office then it's good and does the job. Microphone quality is decent and performs normally in silent enviroments however won't cancel much noise when you're in a crowded place
WORST PRODUCT EVER üëáüëá,1.0,Worst HEADPHONE EVER I ORDER THEM 3 TIMES AND I RETURNED ALL OF THEMTHE FIRST TIME I ORDERED THEIR WAS A BUZZ IN ANY OF THE AUDIO I PLAYED SO THEN I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A DEFECTIVE PICE SO I RETURNED IT .THE SECOND TIME I ORDERED THE SAME PROBLEM HAPPENED THEN ALSO I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A DEFECTIVE PICE SO I PLACED IT FOR REPLACEMENT .THE THIRD ONE WAS A REPLACEMENT ONE AND THE SAME PROBLEM HAPPENED SO NOW I WAS DAMN SURE THESE HEADPHONE SERIES HAD FULL DEFECTS .MY HUMBELS REQUEST IS PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. AND BOAT COMPANY IS READING THIS REVIEW PLEASE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM .** D O.  N O T.  B U Y.  T H I S.  P R O D U C T.  **üôèüôèüôèüôè
Good buy at an affordable price,4.0,I was looking for a pair of bluetooth earphones to use during my gym workouts and I found these for Rs. 999 during a sale event. Here's my review after 1 week of using this product -Pros:1) Excellent bass quality. You'll love these earphones if you are a bass lover.2) The earphones are lightweight and the magnetic tip makes it easy to carry around neck. I find them really convenient to use at the gym3) Good noise cancellation & sweat resistant.Cons:Battery life - boAt claims a battery life of 6 hours but these run out much before that. It shuts down even though my phone displays 20% battery leftEar pain - The ear buds are not the most comfortable pair you can find. My ears start hurting after prolonged usageMic - The voice quality is not that great and not preferred for taking calls.Overall it's a good buy for the price range.
Better than the older one.,5.0,"OK. I had bought this same model 2 yrs before and this model is sooo different from the old one. The battery actually lasts longer for this one. I know coz I had used it for two days and both days I used it a lot. And also the phone is showing the correct charge percentile now. For the older model, the earphones would shut down at 50%. And sometimes it was irritating too. Also I think the Bluetooth module has been upgraded because this model has got quite good range which I didn't get in the older model. Overall, I really like this current model now."
Setting Your Expectations Right,3.0,"At Rs.1499, there are few areas that boAt delivers and largely others where it doesn't. Noise cancellation and bass are it's highlights while you might have to compromise with the poor build quality, sub-par sound clarity and battery life.With 1 week's experience and daily usage I have come to find:1. The battery doesn't support more than 3-4 hours of playtime, even at 70% volume.2. Great bass which might sometimes overshadow the mid and high tones.3. One of the earbuds has stopped working for which I have ordered a replacement and will post an update on the same.@Amazon/Appario: Excellent all-round experience from order placement to delivery to replacement initiation."
Good,3.0,Sound quality is good but not excellent. Noise cancellation is very bad. On call other party can hear alot of surrounding noise along with our voice. Very irritating for other party. Bass is good. Sometimes face issue with Bluetooth connectivity.
battery backup and connectivity distance/range needs to be improved...!!!!!!!!!!!,3.0,"I am writing this review after using this Cellphone over a week usage , I bought this t diwali sale for 999/- colour: Neon*] Battey backup will not come not more than 3-Hours.!!! DISAPPOINTED!!!!*] Bluetooth connectivity is bit poor, while talking voice , it breaks, person in the call will complaint your voice is not clear*] As said bluetooth range is not more than 10Meter*] Good sound Quality Earphones quality is good with strong magnetic lock, Comfortable on earNOTE:  boAT earphone ,difference between  With wire and Wireless, With wire earphone  Sound quality is awesome..!!!!!"
Mic problem.,1.0,"It work fine for normal call and music playback and all. Battery backup is also great. The only worst thing I found is that for webcall (whatsapp, messenger call) the mic will get disconnected. The person at the other end wouldn't listen your voice. Once you disconnect and reconnect the mic will work for a minute and again will disconnect. Very irritating. I am using Galaxy s9 plus handset. Just check others review also before you go for it. Thanks"
Highly Overrated.,3.0,"Although I thought this will be an amazing purchase as I bought certain speakers of boat earlier, but i was very disappointed.Cons:1.Mids are completely missing.2.Too much bass. Ruins the quality of music3.Hurts when listening loud.Pros:1.Light weight.2.Wont fall of while running or something.Conclusion: Do not buy if you are an audiophile. If you are ok with too much bass compromising quality of music while working out, then go for it."
Simply Amazing,4.0,"Sound quality is amazing, Bass is also good , music sound easily manageable, calls easy to answer & hang up, cost is worth. But the reason i‚Äôve given 4 star rating is., it‚Äôs bit uncomfortable, giving the pain in ears , i was using the apple earphones before this and that has the amazing comfort level but unlucky one side of the my apple earphones gone after the use of almost 3.5 years.But again coming to this boat rockerz 255 pro plus, price wise it‚Äôs amazing, rest it‚Äôs completely up to you as everyone has different point of view and choice."
Worst ever after sell service,1.0,"NOW, I'm editing my review,Product is good but they are worst in providing warranty service, i raised complaint for warranty and they took almost 1 month of time to get replaced my earphones. When we get in habit of use of this product then we can't live without this earphones in daily routine, and their customer service doesn't feel it, they took 1 month of time for replacement, worst ever service after sale."
Highly recommended and worth for money,5.0,Head phone is really nice to use.. Writing a review after using it for a week.. Sound quality is good. Very easy to use.. Call quality is also nice. I'm using it for taking long calls and listening music..  It fulfil the purpose. Battery life is good and easy to charge.. This product is good for those who look for good blue tooth headset with decent cost.  No cons as such.. Even the ear bud n model is good to use..
excellent service.,5.0,"I am writing this review after using it for now 9months. Had no intention to write as I believed it to be a normal good buy.  The product since the beginning was perfectly working and was of worth the money I spend according to my budget. I am a constant user of headphones and hence in normal conditions both the earplugs got stopped working recently. With the help of my amazon bill details I requested the company for replacement, trust me I got the best service and got it replaced within time. I really felt nice that the supplier kept their promise of warranty and hence I would surely recommend this supplier for buying new things from them. Thank you Boat rockers, u guys are very very genuine and efficient."
"Pathetic customer service, no response",1.0,"I bought this earphones in Sep 2019, it was working decent and started failing recently. I called the service center in Chennai, Cell tech, pathetic service and response was even worse, its like they dont even want to answer you. Would I buy or suggest anyone to buy this, never in my life, not just this, will never buy any product from Boat brand."
More than average,5.0,The sound and mic quality is good. The person on the other side can hear you Cleary.ConsNo much noise reductionSome times disconnect automaticallyThe are some issue when i connect it to whatsapp call.Overall it is good.
Worst product,1.0,Disgusting product. First one was not working and second one is also good for nothing. Sometimes sound just disappears in between.Above that it give battery low warning every minute after first warning. I hate that sound. It was my mistake to buy this one
Don't buy for music,1.0,Product is too blurry as far as bass is concerned.In this range there are lot more good quality options available.It seems like they have forcefully tuned bass part to sound like that. No music quality .at all
Keeps getting disconnected frequently,3.0,The headsets gets disconnected frequently even when a song is playing. Then gets reconnected again by itself. Sometimes you have to restart the headsets to make connection again. Happens both on mobile as well as with laptop. Will not recommend to buy for this price. Color (teal green) is very good and the sound quality is fine.
"Best in price, Loved it, Go for it",5.0,"First impressions is very good and i was using 255 already. So this best upgrade.  battery is really awome i am binge watching lover, and 3 web series watched without charge earlier 255 was wired headphone for me as i wasn't able to watch single web series in one go. Just loved this headphone"
It's been 3 days only . I will edit it after 3 months but for now,5.0,"INR 999 seriously it's great deal .I use it for study purpose and also for music. I'm quite versatile for my music preference I love hip hop , Rap , EDM and on the same time gazal,  Sufi  songs so my experience with it is amazing like it knows when to use excess bass and when to not .I connect my laptop and mobile with it at same time and it's switch mechanism is great feels like AI built in or something. Double click middle button to call last person you called feature is really helpful.Battery life is also satisfactory I had used about 13 - 14 hours in single charge about 3 hours of video lecture on laptop and about 3 hours of music on mobile and about 1.5 hours on calls and rest on stand by mode.So for now its worth of buying ."
Bluetooth Connection Problem while playing songs.,3.0,"I have been using this headset for 4 months, here is my review:Sound quality - ExcellentNoice cancelation - GoodComfortable - Ear bud not comfortable as it creates pain in ear.Connectivity - Bad (Beginning it was ok but in long usage am facing too much of connectivity problems.Battery backup: Good.Bluetooth Distance: For Short distance it is good like around 7-8 metersOverall comment: Need to improve in connectivity issues and ear bud model. Ear bud can be adjustable but disconnect problem has to be focused."
Sound is good but it is not durable and customer care is pathetic.,2.0,"I used it for approx 6 months (no rough usage), sound is good, you won't be disappointed , but one side stopped working after that. It had 1 year warranty , so I sent it to their service center and it came 'AFTER 1.5 months' (pathetic customer service). And, the product I received after service seemed to be new (it came in new package and brand name was clearly printed on it), but i think i was wrong because it  started showing charging issues just after 1 week and stopped charging after 1-2 months. I mean seriously, you sent it to me after 1.5 months and that too faulty. So, before buying just know that they are not durable,  you can't trust how long they will work. They say it is a sports earphone, but they didn't survived even the normal usage, how are they supposed to perform well if used in sporty way.I won't buy boat products from now."
Battery Disappoints,3.0,Everything is good with this product but only battery Disappoints you. I changed this 3 times thinking it would be battery problem with 1or 2 product but it same was with all.It cannot work for even for 6 hours. But sound quality is superb.For sound 5/5Battery  2/5Fit 5/5
Reviewing after 4 months of use.,4.0,"Evrything is good about this product. Sound quality, Bass, bluetooth connectivity, battery backup-approx 6 hrs. Charging time is about 1 hr to 1.30 hrsOnly issue is for calling u can use this only at a peaceful nd quite place otherwise the other person will not be able to hear ur voice clear."
Amazing... Got what I wanted,5.0,Yes !! Quality is there....I was concerned about the sound but it is way up to the expectations... Treble is a bit low (marginally low) but the Bass n overall sound quality is been exellent... Happy with the battery backup as well... Charge once n use for straight 6-7 hours at high Volume....
A best bass Bluetooth earphones in this price range,4.0,"This is my honest review.It's a wonderful Bluetooth headset in this price range. It has a good sound quality and bam booom bass.As a bass lover I am really impressed with this headsets. I play some songs like whatever it takes and old town road the bass and sound quality fully satisfied me. The pros of this headsets are it has a long battery life compared to the other Bluetooth earphones in this budget @1200,it has a comfortable fit in ears,less weight and the cons are it has a poor range. At the specs they said it has 10 m range but that's not true. In a open place like terrace, the music is interrupted when you walk away from the mobile. The range is nearly 5to7 metres. That's it. If u consider this is not a big problem. Then the headsets are absolutely fine to me. I love it very much."
Amazing value for money bluetooth earphone for BassHeads!,5.0,"I have been using this earphone for almost 5 days now. I started with 100% battery. Till date my battery status is showing 60% !! This is amazing. I can just recharge once and use my Boat earphone for full week!As for the sound, I did slightly miss the chum-chum jingles on high trebles but it adequately compensates it with thumping bass! Noise cancellation works fine too. Not much of a bother. Pretty satisfied with the product."
Average product,2.0,I purchase in RS. 899. BASS and sound is average bquality. Megnate is very poor. My last bluetooth magnete was powerful. Overall product quality and build quality is poor. Mice is good. This product is only for calling with poor built quality. USB charging cable is also 3rd class. I can't charg from this cable. I am already using Boat bluetooth device so I again purchase same brand device but my decision was wrong. This product is average . I give 3 mark from 10.
Proper bass heads and best buy at this budget. Sound quality is good too but not the best.,4.0,The earphones are the best bassheads you can find at such a low budget. Sometimes the bass is so much that the sound quality is compromised. You literally can't listen at max volume on both you phone and earphones. The controls however are very friendly and also the earphones are pretty light weight. Connection issues haven't yet ever surfaced and it's been 4 weeks I am using the earphones and also 2 devices can connect simultaneously.
Doesnt fit { full reveiew down),3.0,Ok this a honest reveiew i suggest to pls listen to me and if u dont u will regret first of all sound quality is fine (distortion at high level) prefer realme neckband very gud audio2. Bass : bass is gud not so much deep bass nut good3. The main thing is due to which i m writing this is that the EarpHone doesnt fit in ear i am honestly saying it wont just fit in ur ear ..... Earbuds are hard very hard no small eartips z ear support doesnt help at all prefer realme neckband just bass is less in realme everything else is fine ...... There was only replacement when i was trying to return item but amazon helped and understanded my concern and help me to return it amazon is just love üôÇ
Best for Bass lover,4.0,I ordered this for 1299 and belive me this is value for money in this price but i am not satisfied with its build quality when i trying to plug it in charging it got a small crack on it. But when we talk about the sound quality its clear and bass is awesome.... I loved it hats off for the bass quality and yeah this also have working passive noice cancellation and mic also work good and connectivity range is decent...Conclusion: if you order this product you will not rigret over all good product üíñ(And if you. Like tech related things you. Can follow my channel HacksOnHigh)
Perfectly good,5.0,"Boat rockerz 255 pro is really awesome to buy for hearing songs and watching movies.But, for gaming I won't recommend it because of short time lapse(0.25secs).And it gives bass and sound quality.And when connecting to 2 devices it is not that much good and noise cancellation is too good so, a busy man will surely be benifited.And connectivity lasts for 10m distance when it is without any intruptions such as walls etc.And, the main thing I want to convey is it is worth for Rs.1050.But,if this product goes for Rs.1500+ then you can move to any other neckbands........THANK YOU!!!!!"
Amazon misguiding Indiansü§¨ü§¨ü§¨,1.0,"Left side headphone sound is little bit lower side.Both side sound should be balanced. Not expected this from Amazon.Sometimes make showing china & sometimes India, can't understand why Amazon trying to fool Indians...Amazon is also sub standard company.Misguided Indians...."
Bluetooth connectivity is the biggest letdown,3.0,"Like many others have already written about it, the Bluetooth connectivity of this piece is embarrassing. You cannot stick your phone in your pocket or a bag and expect your songs to play without a glitch. The connectivity is really that bad. Boat needs to take this earphones off the market and fix the issue. Seriously"
Great indian festival well spent!,5.0,Got this one for 899‚Çπ during great indian festival...for this price it is really a good headphone. The build quality is good...the main attraction is its bass...bass is really good...overall the sound quality is good....also there is no issue with bluetooth connection...battery backup is fine. Worthy purchase under 1000...This is the best bluetooth headphone you can get around 1000 rupees...go for it...
Cheap product don't worth money.,2.0,If you really need a good Bluetooth just wait and try to collect some money otherwise you will end up wasting your money like Me..  Cheap quality and less feature. Ear fiting is also non comfy.  I also don't the hardness of wire it stand straight like a tomboo..
Perfect sound,4.0,"The sound quality with BOAt is excellent, no doubt there. But this particular product was very uncomfortable for me to wear even for small durations of less than 5 mins. The smaller covers were either so small that they slipped. and the regular ones which came fitted were plain uncomfortable for me."
OK for the price,3.0,The headphones are definitely build to last. They have metal heads. There are different size of ear tips which is great. The magnet in the heads is also great and strong. They are comfortable to wear in long durationsSound-The sound is not so great but considering the price i would say its ok-ish. The bass is enhanced and produces a thumping effect. That's it. The mid and lows have are not at all clear and get drowned due to the enhanced bass.Bluetooth range is good and since they are in ear types so they do provide a good seal cutting major sounds around you .Call quality is again OK-ishThey are a no go for an audiophile or some one who listens to mellow songsGo for them only if you are tight on budget ( got it for ‚Çπ999/- ) and are ready to compromise other tones for the bass
Sound/Bass is very good. Design not good. Falls off your ear,3.0,+vesWorks very good for Bass. Sound is a bit low but still okay. Very clear sound. No disturbance at all.-vesThe one I didn‚Äôt like is the design. It doesn‚Äôt fir in your ears properly. It keeps falling down from your ear. The rubber grip doesn‚Äôt hold the earphone in your ear. Should definitely be redesigned. Also the soft part of the wire is little long and looks weird when wearing.
Superb product worth of money ......,5.0,"Very very good product interms of quality and futures. I have been using since 6 months allmost , I used like anything ,those who are looking for best one this is the product .Quality is very goodFutures are very goodThere is no echo voice .Over-all build quality is owsome ."
Charge every day if you listen more then 2 hrs.,3.0,If you have heard Sony before then you won't like these.Average base.Average noise cancelationLooks premiumGood to holdBattery back is not so goodLast about 2-3 hoursWill have to change every day.When battery is low it gives repeated warnings which are irritatingBattery drains fast
Goods and Bads,3.0,"""Great cry little wool"" I can say honestly about it, when I decided to brought new Bluetooth speaker, I preferer to Boat because it's a well known brand but It didn't matches with my requirement. It has some good points and bad points also. fast of all, let's talk about good points- it has amassing sound quality, it destruct you with outer sound. now, it has some bad points also like- It's battery usage is very low, I charge it many times.  It hurt my ears, hence I am unable to use it for a long period of time."
"In FREEFIRE  there is some issue,Some latency seen.",4.0,"Best in this price , value for money.Note -if you are playing PUBG or COD its work properly no any issue  but in FREEFIRE  there is some issue, its not work properly, audio latency can seen in this boat 255pro+ ,This is why i'm giving 4 üåü rating.If you are only a FREEFIRE player so read this review after than purchase it."
Go for it,5.0,"Initially it was not on my list as I thought it was a cheap brand. I was looking for something which could give me good call quality. I tried JBL, Sony and Samsung. None of them could provided the call quality I needed. Then I tried this as last option and to my surprise it was the best and no one ever made a complaint about the call quality.I give 5/5 for all features."
Great product,5.0,"Boat's signature sound quality - fantastic.I wouldn't depend too much on noise cancellation - not too much.Pretty comfortable but I had to take out the extended rubber hooks (or whatever you call it) from the earpieces and it was great then.Would have preferred a shorted cable but it's not a deal breaker.Regular use sweat over ears or at the neck does no harm, but I have been skeptical to try in the rains."
Hassle-free use,4.0,"These are my first Bluetooth headphones. It was easy to connect. The sound clarity is not bad, but a little muffled, I feel. But since I bought it at 1k, I think it was a steal. It comes with 1yr warranty as well. Overall, a good buy. Unlike the neon green variant as I like the pop of colour."
Raised a complient,1.0,This is the worst product in my career...I bought boat wireless headphone through Amazon..It  was not working after three months.I have raised a complient to boat service center.After I got mail from them as send by blue dart courier for the damaged product.but still I have not received  any update from courier office and boat service center.....As the blue dart courier said that many complient  about boat product from the customer.I am very irritate about this...I am not go for any purchase through Amazon in coming days..Thank you...
Communication problems with the phone,1.0,"The sound was good. But they are indeed wastage of money. The earphones did work well for some days when I purchased, but they started making trouble soon. They will automatically get disconnected from your phone once you commence playing any multimedia or audio, and it has been the problem for long now. And because of that, it also irritates you with voice ""disconnected"" or ""your device is ready to pair"". And these voice recordings' volume is always high, doesn't matter what you have adjusted. I regret I  wasted my money on such useless stuff. It is so irritating when you want to listen to your music and it irritates you just because of a silly communication issue. And yes I have checked my phone. It's Bluetooth is working fine."
Best Buy for those who use it more for calling,5.0,"Great battery time,Suitable for gym, calls, while driving.Sound quality is good.Base is Good but its not for Base music lovers, if you want it for all time music then you will feel base is sharp. But if you want to listen music while running, gym or for some time then all good.Overall Best Buy."
"Quite Good, but many more scope for improvement on sound and overall quality.",3.0,"Review after 2 Months of usage :I have never used branded earphones , so I was expecting the performance of this earphones to be decent in all aspects.Some Cons first :1. The neckband material is complete plastic and kinda hurts my back neck when I wore it directly on neck.2. Whenever I am walking somewhat faster , and if my phone (Moto E4 Plus) is in pocket , the connectuvity abrupts some times.3. Claiming warranty is tedious , it should have been more easier e.g. just by scanning an QR code or so.4. The bass is okayish , not the best not bad.5. The snapdragon chip used in this earphones claims to connect two devices simultaneously (Scatternet) but there are no clear instructions on how to do it.6. Just few days ago I have experienced that after connection and in working normal condition, the sound from ear buds stops abruptly , and kind of weird click sound comes and even after reconnecting same issue remains.7. My voice while in call is not really clear , I have to repeat my words while on mic.And here are the pros that I found :1. Battery is quite good , daily I use it for around 2 hours and I charge them once or twice a week, I literally never ran out of battery.2. This earphones seems to have water resistance, few days ago, one of my earbud dipped into water , fortunately earphones just working fine."
Amazing performance...must buy,5.0,"One word for this product ""Awesome"".After initial charging for almost 1 hr started using on Aug 19th evening..Used for more than 40 hrs as of now. Still little bit of charge is remaining.its day 13.Sound quality, call quality , mic everything is good.Initially I bought boat 335, which disappointed me with low battery performance i got nearly 20hrs only. Then I returned that and bought this.But with this boat 255 pro+ i got more than 40 hrs at 50% volume as mentioned in the manual.I used this mainly for YouTube videos, music. Out of the 40 hrs total usage phone calls were just 5-6 hrs.I'm totally happy..and I recommend this to everyone."
It is made in China product,3.0,"With boAt I was expecting a made in India product, was disappointed to receive a made in China. My mistake I didn't check details to confirm this beforehand.Headphone quality is okay, need to wait to check on battery life claim of 40 hours."
Please don't buy,1.0,Bhai kisi ki mat suno youtuber ya kisi review ki bhi sach batau zero noise cancelling hai or bass to bhai pura zero hai me boat ke dusre product use kar raha hu or unke samne waste of money hai bhai please mat kharidna sach bol raha hu
Nice but can be more improved than previous one,4.0,Nice product. Better than sports edition. Bluetooth 5.0 working properly nice. Good connectivity throughout the home another rooms. Battery looks good . Noise cancellation is not so proper. Sound us lil bit crisp...in high volume sound must be crack on high pitches notes....in 6-7 sound feels goid sound but all over nice
worst product due to Battery issue,1.0,"Sound quality good 80/100Bass 75/100Battery 01/10016/04/2021 maine Amazon se purchase kiye tha, 1 month accha chla 1¬Ω hrs charge karne pe 8 hrs chal jate tha, 2 month baad 5-6 hrs chlne lage phir abhi 03 July 2021 ko 1¬Ω-2hrs charge karne k baad 5 minutes chlte then power off due to battery low...Phir jab boat customer care wale se baat kiye maine 16/07/2021 ko to boat customer care wale ka support to itna accha hai ki abhi tak mera parcel receive nahi hua haiBoat ka earphone agar purchase kar rahe ho to 6 month k ander kaise money waste ho jayega"
Good but not great.,3.0,Got it for Rs. 999. It's been 3 months of usage. Okayish product under 1000 but not worth the 1500.Sound quality is OK. Noise cancellation is average. In a traffic or crowed places background voice is dominating than ours. Sometimes gets disconnected when trying to pair it up with our phones. That ear hook is not for everyone and causes severe pain on my ears but we can remove it form the headphone. End call notification is not there atleast a beep when the call ends would be fine. My suggestion only buy if it costs less than 1000.
Battery Backup is Not up to mark,3.0,"Review after 2 weeks of usage(-)Sometimes pairing is too slow even takes 1 min which is very high.(-)Battery back up is not good.(+) Good for people who have low indoor network coverage. u can place ur phone to window side ,connect this earphone and enjoy improved call quality anywhere around 10 m radius.(+) Good if u get this thing for 999 or low. Otherwise bad choice.(+) Double tap middle button for calling most recent contact which is good for me."
Okay Product,5.0,"It‚Äôs good. Clear sound, Deep bass, fits well in the ear, has decent battery life. If you expect it to look premium, you will be disappointed. I find it just okay. The wire looks delicate and one might damage it if not used with care. It‚Äôs a rubber coated u bend and buttons are also coated. Felt the blue tooth connection a bit unreliable and I have often felt it to crash if your phone is kept in your trouser pocket. Connecting it to any device is easy and super quick and with no obstruction, it works fine.Overall it‚Äôs okey for the price I paid (899‚Çπ)."
Replacement and services,3.0,I purchased this headphone few months ago after 2 month i found some problems with their wire then I registered my complaint last months from their website and till now i haven‚Äôt recived any confirmation from boat side their cc not picking my call I tried from last months after that i send email aswell approx 50 time but I didn‚Äôt recived any reverts from their side.boat service is so pathetic I advise to go with any other brand as compare to BOAT
Better than OnePlus go for it,5.0,"For the price, its just awesome. I had initially bought Onepluse bullet wireless but replaced it with this as rhe one plus had issues when taking calls(it's an on going tech issue). Boat wireless head band works like a charm for listening to music, vidoes and taking internet and regular calls."
Overall good,4.0,Hello all. Writing review after 10 days of use. I use it only for jogging around 50min a day. Got it charged the first day and till. Now I didn't need to charge it. So the battery backup is fair enough. During calls also it is quiet good. The person at the other end can hear me without any disturbance. Sound quality is good. For songs played at full volume the voice cracks but the sound at full volume is too loud so ideally we don't need to go that high. I got it at 1350 with discount. Overall my experience with it is good. I loved it.
Good product,5.0,"Super bass as you hear and good battery backup, If you use under 1 amp charger it may not get charging so always use between 1 to 2 amps charger. Never charged 100% or full. If battery goes 30% plug-in charger for 20 to 30 minutes and enjoy full day."
Amazing sound quality but not reliable,4.0,Bang for the buck. Only improvement i would suggest is a longer battery life. It lasts only for couple of hours of usage. And after 9 months of usage it is now broken. The right channel doesn't have a voice now. Stays connected in idle state for a day though. But if we use it continuously it doesn't last longer than max 2.5 hours.
Best Deal,5.0,"A device worth buying.Sound quality is excellent ( for phone calls actually it depends on network and for music it purely depends on media player with equaliser).Battery is low for normal usage. (Reviewing after using for 2 days) It came up with 80% battery and after using for 4 hrs, it is showing 40%."
Don‚Äôt Buy..Go for Sony or JBL,1.0,Stopped working in 3 months.Claimed warranty but it takes forever..still haven‚Äôt received the replacement as well as no email or SMS or call from Boat.Don‚Äôt buy these earphones...spent a little extra and buy Sony or JBL at least their products a good and if any issues they treat their customers better and resolve the issue quickly.I already bought another Bluetooth earphones and I guess I‚Äôm gonna wait for 7-8 months for Boat to replace their faulty product.
Great Buildquality and good sound signature,5.0,"Firstly I have used this for almost a year. Very good connectivity long lasting battery life better build quality than any other brand in this price segment.But it has a con also, boat should definitely work in the eartips quality it feels itchy and not that soft , I just changed the eartips with jbl 150si's and sound quality became 20% more pleasant immediately... Boat ‚õµis very good brand and I hope they improve eartips material and quality."
Decent earphones.. could be better if it had long range and no unnecessary static sounds,3.0,"Decent earphones taking into consideration price(900 rs) and sound quality. Low Bluetooth range .Sometimes Static sounds comes when nothing is being played or when bing connected,which is very irritating.Also there should be some extra weight on center so that it balance between both ears and neck.Hopefully they would improve ."
Bass Heavy in Budget.,5.0,"The Bass and Sound output of the earphones are astonishingly loud for the price.Fit could have been better, but that has also been taken care of by providing extra ear tips.Noise cancellation can be termed as best in class, for the price. You barely listen to stuff going on around, even at 60% of the volumes. (Depends on choice of songs, as I say that. Still, substantial Noise Cancellation!!)Connectivity flickers a bit as you leave from one room and go to another, doubting the connectivity range mentioned. But even that is totally manageable..Too good for the price kind of product, no secodn thoughts required. Just Go For It!!! :)No second thoughts required. Totally go for it."
Best for music and not for calls,4.0,Product quality looks like it was already used because I can observe dust over ear buds and color faded than the usual picture as shown.Charging will be completed with in hour with 2A charger and last for 48 hours for the users who listens music mostly and less for calls.But disappointing thing for calls it is not all good and better only for music lovers.
"3.5/5 stars, good at this price range itherwise ok ok",4.0,"Good build quality at this price range. Sound quality is good but a little improvement will be appreciated. No battery indicatiin. No full charge indication. No option to change the male notificatiin voice to female notification voice. Glitches are too often. Battery level indication in connected phone is wrong, shows 100% and 80% then direct 20% 4 to 5 minutes before shutting down."
Decent product under 1000 rupees,4.0,Pros-Decent sound quality-good bass-sufficient battery life-excellent noise cancellation-magnetic earbudsCons-annoying beep sound while increasing and decreasing volumeSummaryOverall a decent product under 1000 rupeesSound quality is better than ant audio wave 702 wired earphone
Great Value for Money if you get any deal,4.0,"Overall really good earphone, I just wish that they had provides a couple of other rubber earbud cover sizes the one that comes is a bit small. But sound quality and battery life is excellent!! The design is also  nice with magnets to keep the earphone from falling off when not in use"
Satisfaction,5.0,"length of its both wires are frustrated as too lengthy and not comfortable at all, when you fix the buds in ears not hearing any outside sounds clearly...Also hurting eqrs. Other than aboveBattery capacity and Bluetooth range & built quality r good...Inspite of my review,I loved the warranty of the productMy product's right bud wasn't work for a while I have opted for claiming warranty, they were accepted my warranty and replaced with another piece within 20 days...You really awesomeboat"
Nice Ear phone at cost of 1099,3.0,Like:Price: I got it in 1099 in an offerBase: Superb baseNoise cancellation: quite good at this price range of productHandling: you can easily use it while running in the gym or park.Dislike: The earphone cable is of low quality. It got a tear just after a month.  The service center charged me Rs. 450 to get it replaced even earphone comes with a 1-year replacement warranty.
Hearing break in sounds every 2-5 seconds.,1.0,"I am completely  disappointed  with this device) You will hear break sounds if you are watching movies (even offline), on calls (you will hear break sounds and person in front of you complain that he not getting proper voice) and frequency  like every 5- 10 second (even batteryshows 90%). ( for cross check  disconnect the Bluetooth and replay the dialog  then you can easily compare)"
A budget all-rounder by boAt,4.0,"I have been using boAt wireless headphones since two years they have never disappointed me.This is my 3rs boat wireless headphones but i must say this one impressed me alot according to the price segment (Rs 999),it's doing a perfect job of delivering good quality of sound.Regarding the battery life its is 6hrs, but its quite Ok since i have purchased it for 999rs only i can't expect much from it.Coming to sound quality it has a bit more bass, the bass is more than treble but not a problem for those who love high bass.Overall sound quality is more than good in this price segment.The build quality is not that high quality but yes it is sturdy enough to withstand normal drops.Acording to me the length of cord is too lengthy.One thing i dint like about boaAt is connectivity range, the range of connectivity for this is less than 10m,but again budget matters. Given a thought i had paid only 999rs,i am very much satisfied with overall performanceRegarding service center, the customers leaving in Mumbai has added advantage as i had.My previous boat rockerz 275 one earpieces suddenly stopped so i visited the service center in Goregaon and they replaced my headphones with new in just 5 minutes without any questions asked.So customers in Mumbai don't worry about the warranty."
Higher Price With Moderate Sound Quality!,2.0,"A good product for performance but not good for that price ! Else ok for buyer,good blutooth connectivity,sound quality must say towards BASE and less TREBLE! Noise cancellation is mostly adjusted with the help it‚Äôs fitting in ears! Or may be done by active circuit then sacrificing the sound quality!Else ok!"
Please it's a request don't buy this. You will waste your money,5.0,I am writing this review because I had been using my boAt rockerz 255 for almost a year and hence I thought this one would b more better. However to my utmost disappointment I regret buying this one. Firstly the range is too low. I mean only a couple of distance and the thing looses it's connectivity. Secondly when I'm on call the opposite person finds my sound too low or at times can't even hear me. Battery life is ok. Sound is good. Bass is good. But I didn't expect this low quality from boAt. I should've bought my old model only. It was amazing with sound n battery and range and noise cancellation and everything.Utter waste to money and disappointed
Does not work with linux ! Worst design factor !!,1.0,"Update : These earphones does not work with linux ( tried with ubuntu, zorin, mint,elementry) . I have Airdopes 441 and that works flawlessly with linux also.Completely useless earphones due to uncomfortable design . The wires are so hard that you constantly keep on feeling as if something is hanging beside your face. A constant downward pull in both the ears.The sound and bass is Good. But I dont think that should be the only criteria to judge the earphone."
Nice sound quality but poor mic quality,4.0,"Kudos to the product, for giving this sound quality in this price point. Got it for 1000 bucks on sale . But considering the original price bracket i would definitely recommend you to add 2-300 bucks and buy realme bluetooth earphones coz the ony drawback i found in these is its mic quality, most of the times it picks external voices more then yours which causes disruption and flickered tone. Rest sound quality is good"
Do not buy,1.0,I purchase this headphones but not satisfied with this product sound quality  is not good and there is lag between videos sound. Headphone plastic quality is also poor. Don't purchase because if you purchase this you could not get refund on this after delivery
REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS,2.0,Although For a price of 1100 they are quite considerable ( for the sky blue variant ) and the pros and cons are -1. The sound quality is Good2. Good For listening Deap Bass songs.Cons1. Completely ruins gaming experience as the Latency is at its Peak.2. Loud Alerts for Battery low and powering on.3. Many times our voice is not clearly audible to opposite person on Phone call.4. During a meet call if we switch to other multi media apps like youtube both the sounds completely try to kill each other and we can not even operate them individually like we get the option when we are using any wired earphone.5. Of no use in daily life
Review,3.0,After using for 2-3 weeks:1. Quality of sound is fine. Nothing unusual.2. Bass quality is ok.3. I found connectivity issues quite common if it is connected to 2 devices.4. Many a times automatic bluetooth connection does not work!!5. Quality is worth the moneySome of these could be possible defects in my device!!
Small Sized NeckBand & Caller ID Announcement,4.0,Neck Band Size is smaller than other brands in same type of headphone ( Specially in comparison of used brands - Jabra / Blaupaunkt ) Thus Slightly adjustability problems.Caller's Name is announced while Call received ( compatibility from Handset too required ). Thats Important while working handsfree.
Affordable Bluetooth neckband,4.0,This is a type of Bluetooth you shld buy only if this is...on offer cuz at it's price u can have better option.. it has good sound quality and if u r a type of person...while lives for bass music then this will be..a fair deal but it..gets Disconnected on its...own and u'll have to again connect this.. and if u r leaving ur phn in room and u go to second room while u r in call then voice starts..breaking..!!though sound quality is...good and pblms...are not so very focusing....so u could...go for it...!! As on your preferences..!!

Little bit overweighted..its falling down coz of it,3.0,"Fitting in ear is not proper due to slightly overweight..its falling down coz of it , heavyness of right earphone due to the additional control panel strip on earphone s wire this is second reason of that ... over-all wire is little long its not looking good ...look so down when not in use"

Good Product but won't fit into my ears,3.0,"Boat product quality is satisfactory and value for money..But requested return within an hour i opened the pack..Since I found it is not properly fits into my ears..It is coming out..After years using headset, this is my first experience."
Not a that good product practically,3.0,This is a detailed review unlike past ones you've readFirst things the good things about the product-:1- battery is superb it easily gets along 3 4 days on a single charge as per my daily usage2- sound quality is awesomeThe things i Don't like are -:1- the length is very long. When you run they jiggle and sometimes fall off as the weight is quite heavy2- the battery is long lasting but you could easily get 12 hrs battery life with a cheap and light productAnd trust me 12hrs is good well enough for anyone3- they are very heavy and non comfortable
Value for Money,4.0,"After 6 month use, I can say this is best Bluetooth head phone in 1500 rupee.Likes:- Good battery life. On descriptions it had written 8 hours but I'm getting 1.5 day battery life in a single charge.- Sound it good and extreme bass. 5* for bass- Built quality is very good. light weight and handy.Dislikes:- sometimes it disconnect and reconnect automatically- ear buds are not holding my ear perfectly and some time it's slip down."
Stopped working after 18 days of use,1.0,"I bought this product on 3rd november and now suddenly it's not working,do not buy!and the sound quality isn't great even with the highest volume sometimes you cannot hear and when you send it torepair it takes about 20 days to be sent back."
Worst product. Never buy boAt products. Total waste of money.,1.0,"Worst product. Even local products are better than this product.Right side speaker stopped working just 45 days after purchase. Customer care number given on boAt Rockerz web site was not reachable at all. I went to service centre in Vashi,  mentioned in web site, 4 times and everytime I received responce that boAt Rockerz 255 wireless headphones are out of stock. I can come next week and check. I am fed up of this product and after sales service.I also emailed on customer care email id mentioned on website. I got no reply. I sent reminders, i got no reply. I am seriously fed up of boAt products.I wasted my hard earned money in this product. I will never buy boAt product and will tell everybody to not to buy any boAt product."
"Good, could have been better.",4.0,"The headphone seems nice, however lately I found some issues with the microphone while using in laptop during video conferencing, the audience could not get my voice. With a great effort, I finally manage to speak by holding the microphone closer to my mouth. Not faced this problem with mobile."
Keeps falling off,3.0,"The biggest problem is that they don't stick 8n the ears and keeps falling off.Sound wise it's ok, nothing great.Delivery on time even in lockdown.I could have rated higher if not for the bad grip. I had used Boult pro curve before and they are designed perfectly to hold in the ears unlike this  headphones.Got it 899, anything higher that 1k is waste of money."
Not bad,3.0,Bought them to check their sound quality...i wud say not so good...you can get the best sound quality with jbl and skullcandy wired headsets which will cost you just 500...when you want wireless than I'll suggest..again..jbl or skullcandy...which will cost you a 1000 more but they are worth your money...don't buy these
Waste product and worst customer care,1.0,"I'm writing this review 6 months after using the product. All of a sudden lots of issues have started, battery dies after 15 mins usage, can't make calls via the device. Registered a complaint in their website and the product was picked up by courier since it is in warranty, its been more than a week now, no update from the company. The customer care number provided is always unanswered. Don't waste your money on Boat devices."
I have some connectivity issues,3.0,I have some connectivity issues. 29 I buy this product. Jan 05 the product's return window is closed. But I have some issues. How can I rectify this. Pls help me.And also noise cancelation is not working properly. Many time when iam in croud place. There is so many noises in my call. So I disconnect my Bluetooth and use direct call.
"Nice product, can buy",4.0,"I am writing this review after using it for 5 months. Its working as like day 1. No changes or problem in bluetooth and sound quality, Good. But sometimes it shows wrong % of charge in some device when we connect. So, I will say you can't trust the % charge but it will not matter for you when you will use regularly. It's battery backup is good, I used it for 7 hrs continuously still it has 40% charge. Nice product."
Battery backup 4 hour and sound quality is not upto the mark ..as bass is not good.,3.0,Its been 10 days ...since day one it get charged in 20 min and discharged within 4 hour only..As boat 255pro claim for 6 hour batter backup but couldn't reach upto the mark.Sound quality is quite good ..u can't expect bass from this model of boat ..For good quality of sound u should search above 2000 rupees product...of reputed brand..Overall Not recommended for them who use earphone for long time..not for student who study online.
Battery backup is awesome.,5.0,Pros1. Sound quality is good in this price point.2. Battery is awesome. I have using around 6 day and daily i was use aroud 4/5 hour and till date charging still 60% i thought i can use more 4/5 days.Cons1) If you are havy bass lover then this is not for you. Bass is good but not for bass lover because it's maintain balanced sound.2) For some person they can face fitting issue because of that holder yes we can remove but without holder it will slip from your ear.
What I wanted,5.0,"This is a great product. The best part is the design. It's been crafted with so much care that it fixes all the issues anyone otherwise would have with any earphone - such as constantly popping out of ears, ears getting sweaty, well balanced on shoulder and you don't even feel it if it just lies there."
Kindly Don't buy and waste your money...,1.0,"Don't buy this Product. I'm a regular user of this Headphone... It was working fine in the last few months, exactly 4 months. Few days back, it's not at all working...Problem is While charging this Headphone, it shows battery is full and when we tried to turn on the Device , it's not turning ON....1300/- gone within 4 months of use... Kindly don't buy this product and waste your money..."
Good sound quality & good customer service,4.0,Giving this review after using 10 months. Very good customer service. My earphone stated creating some problem in mic just few days ago . Boat did arrangement for free pick up service and they repaired it and sent it to me. Good sound quality. Value for money
Battery issue,1.0,"I am writing this review after using this for 4 complete days:+ves*compatible with neck and ears.*Bluetooth connectivity is fast.*look & design is awesome.-ves*earphone size is littlebit big: mainly with the earset which gives pain in ears when you mix helmet & earphones (while driving).*finding disturbance in music when im ‚Äúrunning‚Äù (probably due to connectivity issue)*music: everytime When there is change in song or toggle between music/video/call/other, experiencing an irritative beep sound.*Bass is not that good*when im driving: (onCall) sound quality is low & bad and mic aswell.*siri not working*grip for earbuds/earset is low quality and can damage anytime*when on call: other person keeps complaining about low voice and disturbance (..mic problem)*most concerned and the biggest problem with this bluetooth earphones is BATTERY backup;Even though when im not using bluetooth (call or music) battery discharging.*very bad thing: battery/charging directly falls from 80% to 0% within no time.*it is giving 3hours of battery backup only (at the max.i am returning this product: mainly because of battery backup which is a big issue for any bluetooth device!Really disappointed with the performance."
Pathetic product,1.0,boAt Rockerz 255 pro wireless headphone I ordered and on the day 3 the charging cable stopped working mean after spending good 1400 u get a headphone without cable it's pathetic I will never ever recommend anyone to buy this product not from Amazon or from anywhere they fool people showing only good quality they don't show the bad comments.In my family everyone use Amazon but now I will tell everyone to delete the app and stop using it such a pathetic product. never buy nothing from here
"Sound not great, Earbuds uncomfortable",3.0,"These earphones are okayish. Sound is not so great, but decent for a earphone in this price range. Also the earbuds are damn uncomfortable while using it for 30 mins +.If you are looking for a earphone with mic to attend meetings or talk over phone then I highly recommend this. But if you are looking something for listening to music then these could not be a great choice."
Fantastic product. Justify it's price üëçüèª,4.0,"The only thing which not same as on the specs sheet is the battery. The company claims 40hrs of battery backup at 50% volume. But it's definitely not the case. You will get 30-35hrs of battery backup. But still it's more than enough when you compare it to others earphones at this price range. You can't really complainüò¨.Otherwise, the product is overall good, justify it's price. The sound quality is good, the bass for which boat is known for its fantastic. The call quality is superb."
Boat rockers 255,4.0,Sound is very good.....but i think their is a design issue which make it not fit in ear properly.... that's why one can't experience the bass properly if not tightly pushed in. Battery life is suprb upto 6 hours and charging time 1.5 hrs. But due to metal finishing in winter it becomes very cold and hurts the ears. The summer u can think....Its a nice purchase for listening music but some  designing faults i can see that's it.
I feeling Like I was Cheated!!!!,1.0,"Exactly after a Week of Last day of Return, the Product Started malfunctioning.  It Does not get switched on without plugging to a power source (Some times). Automatically, the Volume is getting reduced and Increased, Automatically the Songs getting Paused and Changed in the middle.. (No touch required at all....). Mic also Not working properly. I have checked this with Other Mobile also , and got the same results.Full time u can hear the Sound of Some one Pressing the volume Button.. Beep Beep beep.I want to Return or Replacement. Very bad Experience."
Worst item with zero noise cancellation,1.0,sound quality: -100000Noise cancellation: -200000Amazon should immediately discontinue this item.Such a worst item
Reliable for daily use since the last 8 months,5.0,"Bought this for Rs 999 in Oct 2019 and have been using it on an almost daily basis since then.It has got good bass and noise cancellation is also good.Charge will last through 1 whole day and it gets charged quickly within 15 minutes.Only con is that yesterday, the small rubber flip cover for the charge port fell out. So I will need to use it carefully and clean it so dust wouldn't get stuck in the port.I would recommend this to everyone for its quality. But the price shown now for Rs 1,499 is a bit high as I had got it for cheaper."
Disadvantages,4.0,"After 2 days of use:Pros already everyone knows as shown in product details, I'll talk about cons about which one should know before buying.Cons are written in descending order of severity:1. Not sturdy in ears, I have to adjust them every 10 minutes2. Battery %age shown in mobile isn't accurate, we have to depend on wearable's signal of low battery.3. It may look little weird when we wear it due to its built. I'll say it's 60% not okay to wear outdoors.All in all, you can go for it, it's good for people who multitask.According to me, they are amazing and all the features said in the details are accurate."
A huge disappointment!,1.0,"As much as I was looking forward to using these Bluetooth earphones, they turned out to be a huge disappointment. The call quality is pathetic, there's so much background noise that overlaps your voice, the receiver is not able to hear you clearly. Always feels like the voice is coming from a distance and there's a lot of background noise. Only the music experience is good, however call is the most important function for which we need earphones and this definitely isn't a good option. Disappointed by boAt!"
Duplicate product,1.0,Hello Amazon  I had buy earphones and i think its only month before i bought but there is some problem now am facing am.not able to connect it with phone and if i only put it on charge than only its connecting other wise not and its fully charged than also if i put it charge it will work what i have to do its also have warranty.Are you selling duplicate produts..??I want refund my money orelse i want good original earphones.i cant afford to loose 999 rs its hard to earn you easily sell defective product so i want refund or original earrphones.I have bill and warranty cardSo.reply meAnd i am refusing my friends and family not.to buy this product from here
Don't buy!,1.0,The headset model is faulty. It doesn't get disconnected even if your long press power. It malfunctions while playing music. Got it replaced too but had the same issue. The moment it comes in contact of sweat it starts to malfunction
If you are planning about buying this so by adding a little money you can buy best product!,2.0,"I had ordered boat initially and found it not good as much as i expect , Actually, currently i am using OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bass Edition (Reverb Red) so as compared to i found more comfort with oneplus as its functioning quite smooth you don't have to connect every time through bluetooth and the material of product is not as boat product, you will not feel any pain in your ears after wearing long. That's it and at last i think i will say if you are planning about buying this so plz by adding a little money you can buy bset product and you will not regret it!Thank you!"
Great to use,5.0,I have to be on calls throughout my day as my profession demands that. My colleague suggested me for this as everyone in my office is using this. I am happy with the sound quality & best part is that it cancells the other noises once fitted properly just like head phones. Also I loooovveee this color that I bought ü•∞
Decent pair of earphones for the price!!!,4.0,6-Months review:Pros:1.Price- Won't get anything better for this price2.Build Quality- Decent3.Bluetooth-Most of the Boat bluetoot- headsets have connectivity issues but not this oneCons:1.Incorrectly displays battery percentage as 100% all the time and then suddenly gives a warning and dies2.Not very comfortable!! Can't wear for more than 30 mins3.Decent bass but poor mids and highs- not good enoughConclusion: I would recommend you to buy ptron tango tws for 1500
Great product and sound at Rs1000 : ),5.0,"The price is great for the quantity of sound it offers at Rs1000. Ok , good , great are my rankings.Great - PriceGreat - SoundGood - BatteryGood - BassGreat - FlexibilityGreat - Product qualityOnly 2 complains .I hve to charge battery every day (max 5 hour continuous use)My left ear sound is getting low thats an issue that bothered about.  Evn my friend faced the same issue that one side of his headphone stoped working(5 months of use for freand & 1 month for me ) . And that an quality issue . I hope i will get replacement under warranty.  And mind it no physical damage or water damage.But at that price point its worth it .And imp thing the light turns frm red to blue when fully charged ."
Quality and battery backup of product is very bad,4.0,"It has not much quality which is mentioned in this and also the battery backup is also very poor which is less than 2 hours which is very bad for this. the battery percentage abruptly come down from 100 to 40 then it become zero. Yeah, it did very disappointed to me. So overall , the product is not good that much I have heard about it. I don't know it happened with me or every customer could be disappoints by this."
All you need to know about the product,4.0,"This product is definitely one of the best in its rangeIt has the best bass quality in its range , comes with a year warranty although after some use you may find its sound a bit less , otherwise no issue and easy repair/replace by the company for malfunctioning product saying this with experience bcoz the first ones delivered to me started malfunctioning after some use but after filling a complaint with the company it was resolved they replaced my unit with another one but took like a moth in the process which to some extent is considerable as it was a door to door service"
Best Product,5.0,"Best product I have ever used. I have use JBL, one plus buds but the battery back up is worst in both these products. In boat rockerz++ has good battery backup last for whole day continuous use. Sound quality is good. Charge in minimum time. Sturdy to use. Only cons is I have to press hard for switch off the device."
Good but connectivity distance issue,5.0,"Nice product using for listening music and also for calls.Good sound quality, before this i used many Bluetooth earphones but this is best.Good sound and bass when playing music.During call both side happy. receive good quality sound , mic quality is also good , caller can listen a very low sound also.Battery backup is awesome."
Good Product,4.0,Boat Rockerz 255I got this product at a very discounted price.It has been a year since I purchased the Boat Rockerz 255.The Call Quality in this BT headset is Excellent and noise cancellation is good.The Bass quality is OK when compared to wired headphones.It does not support Smartphone's Inbuilt Equaliser.After longer use you feel pain in the Ear.Battery Back up is 4 Hours for Movie Watch.Overall a good product for the Discounted price I had Bought.
Neck support is like wire so it can fell anytime from neck and you can lose it.,1.0,"Neck support is just in form of flexibility wire. The earphone will keep falling from neck and top most care is required for not loosing it as it may fall anytime from your neck. The bud magnet joints from a perticular side so it takes lot of effort to join them from a perticular side. Brand is superb but this specific earphone is not worth of many even if it comes in 1000 rs as it can fell anytime from neck . One big disadvantages I observed is in between of call or watching vedio, the Bluetooth connection gets disconnected and than reconnected automatically."
Feeling bad buying this.,2.0,"Sound quality isn't that good. Not worth the cost. Durability, well it comes with a plastic construction, that you need to wear around neck. So can't fit it in anything.Feeling bad buying this product considering the image doesn't clarify the plastic ring around the neck. Oh yes one more thing Ear piece has rubber hook on it but design is so bad that you can't get it in ears properly."
Poor quality,1.0,"I cursed the manufacturer and bought a Sony product. No noise cancellation, rather it catches noise, the person on the other side of phone an only hear noises rather than your voice. Sound is okay quality. Go for JBL of same price, they have better mic, I personally have used them. The only positive thing is that you can connect two devices simultaneously with this BT headphone."
Go for it,4.0,"Nice product, I just liked it. True suggestion one can go for it blindly in Rs.1299/- Battery backup is awesome. Type.C support. I am using this for online classes for last one week daily 3-4 hours and it is still having 20‚ÑÖ charge even after using 26 hours.But in buold quality, 255pro feels more premium than 255 pro+. But in long run + will.survive as it has more battery backup."
DONT BUY..BAD QUALITY,1.0,these are really bad ones.... Stopped connecting after  few days... Dont buy.. Quality of sound aint that good as well..
Can‚Äôt use for phone calls,3.0,"Build quality is okay .It‚Äôs been 15 months since my purchase and it‚Äôs still in good shape.Sound quality is good for money.Good for listening to songs and videos.Base is also decent.Problem is with noice cancellation.Even in a silent room , small sounds are amplified to the person on other side of call .If you are purchasing for phone calls or for online classes, don‚Äôt go for it."
Sound is not clear and battery also poor,1.0,"Sound is not clear and battery also poor, customer service is worst i had face.I'm totally disappointed with boatThey don't send return money instead of they told me the amount is freez on your bank. You go and fill the form then bank they will clear your amount otherwise not. Worst experience with boat rockers 255."
Great quality and a suggestion to manufacturer,4.0,"Very good quality. The manufacturer has given option of connecting to multiple devices at a time. Explore the option of having the device active for latest connection. For example, I have connected to laptop and mobile. When I'm watching a video on laptop, if I get a call to mobile and I answer it, laptop connection should be on hold and I should be able to talk on phone without interruption. Currently while talking on phone, if I get a notification on laptop, it makes call inactive and connects for a laptop notification for few seconds and then switch back to phone.There should be an optimum way of handling this.Apart from thisz amazing product!"
Malfunctioning....go for JBL,3.0,It starts getting disconnected in with 1-2 minutes gap ....last for 2-3 hours....no matter how many time you reset ..the device...and this cycle countinue with a gap of 2-3 days.....but atleast their warranty services is good they pick-up and deliver at your door step so ..it's good...I have already replaced it like 4 time... within a month......but same problem again and again.... this kinda problem exists in every boat product (Bluetooth) ....go for JBL if you really want to buy....
Best Customer Service !,5.0,"I bought these earphones in January this month.Later in September, I started facing some issues in the microphone. I registered a complaint on bOaT portal and attached the invoice.The next day, a pick-up guy came and collected the defected earphones from my house, and in less than 2 weeks' time, a brand new set was at my doorstep. Just amazing!The sound quality is very good. The only issue I am facing with these earphones is you can't take online classes with it. My students say that it gets disconnected in between the meeting.  If this microphone issue is fixed, then this headset is worth Rs.2000. I wish bOAt guys will fix it soon."
Highly recommended,4.0,"I have used this Boat Rockerz 255 Pro for taking online tutions of kids. It has good noise cancellation, so least disturbance.The sound quality is also amazing. Have also listened to music....bass is good.All in all would recommend this to anyone who wants a good neckband pods in medium range."
Product is nice but warrenty and services fake,2.0,"Don't buy this product on seeing the 1 year warranty cause if any problem comes earphone then service centre process will be very long even its take one to two month and not certain that product you get back. In my earphone one sided was not working and product was under warranty, I complaint.Pick up of product was initiated by xbees courier service and I am still checking my service request which is not completed yet. Nearly 1 month going to complete and I have no idea where is my product. Very cheap service and when you call the service centre number which is toll free number its always gone busy I mean you can't complain or you can't do enquiry of your product after complain."

worst product and worst battery,1.0,"worst product. after charging for 2.5 hours also the battery lasts for maximum 10 hours without use. I go to bank at 9 and after that I hardly use my phone barring some urgent/official calls. despite not being used the battery discharges and sound doesn't sound good. Please, don't buy this product. put some more money and buy anything else.Volume also decreases after some time. The design is also not that comfortable to put on in the ear. Again, I would suggest put some extra money and get a different one."
Excellent Product for music lovers.,5.0,Bass quality is pleaseant. No Ear pain while using usually I will not use it for long hours.  After watching full movie using headphone I didn't feel any difference. But I doubt that whether it will be used for hard workouts in gym or Ground because grip is not right.Overall nice product for Hearing Songs.
Need improvement,2.0,"I dint find this good product.1. Ear support is not good due to which ear start paining after every few minutes.2. Sound quality is not great3. The person on other side of call keep complaining about background noise.Pros,Get connected very easily.Battery life is good enough."
Mediocre quality headset.,2.0,"The sound quality is at best average. Although the fit n finish is good, the most annoying feature is that it frequently gets disconnected while in use. I would not suggest buying this particular model.I am planning a switch to a better brand. Maybe JBL or Samsung"
Can buy if you are dealing with music & voice calling issues.,5.0,I was first confused to order as I was also surrounded with people using the same device. Then I order one & it's pretty much descent in this price point. Well I ordered this while the GIF sale was happening & I spent just Rs. 999/- for this product. Now I am using this from last 5 days. Music was not only my concern but while calling i needed a clear voice cancelling device & surprisingly it turned out to be an amazing device. You can buy this if you have a use for both music & voice calling. Thanks!
Best product for gift someone or self use in Reasonable price,4.0,First of all I wd like to say about delivery is so quick by Amazon....and about products rockerz 255+ is best in 1099 more then earbuds...! battery life awesome I got this product 12 Oct 21 I m still using 60% charge remain didn't charged yet sounds quality good bass is super but I just put in charge for check it like charging would be fast or not but it's true fast charged...i can take call without using mobile via button üîò I can give 4‚≠ê out of 51‚≠ê cut because it's hurts due to removed on this supporter of earbuds in ear after long time
Decent product for the price with struggling battery life,3.0,"While the product is cost effective, there are issues with the battery life. It says 6 hours but it just lasts for appx. 3 hours. Also it says 60% battery and then in a split second it starts to display battery low to 20%. This has been happening always.  Decent sound quality for the price. Go for it only if you are looking for something cheap to use while it lasts."
Disconnects sometimes in between,4.0,"I have been using these earphones for about 2 months, and this is what I feel like. The noise cancellation is of optimal quality. You won't hear most noises even when the music is off. The battery life is amazing. It easily works for more than 6 hours once fully charged. The only drawback I am facing is that it sometimes disconnects in between a movie or meeting. It takes about 2 minutes to reconnect, which is quite a long time when in an important meeting. Maybe it's just my product, but consider this con when buying them."
Much better than I expected,5.0,This earphones are really something else. Too good. Like complete another world. Best clarity and thumping and punching bass. Built quality is amazing too. This is much better than Sony WI XB400 in terms of built quality and sound quality.Pros :1. Crisp and clear sound quality2. Ultimate and balanced bass3. Durable built quality4. Amazing battery backup5. Easy to useCons:0
Little disappointed with performance on MTK processor,3.0,I think it doesn't support MTK processor for best CVC as opposite person could hear background noise of vehicles when used in traffic.  Sound and bass quality is good. I think it works best with Qualcomm processor as mentioned but not that best with MTK processor.
"Great one for the price,Decent one for the sound",5.0,"Been using this since about a month now,First of all Kudos to Amazon for super fast delivery.Earphones are definately one of the best in price range1. Battery :- about 5-6 hours of continuous use on a single charge, pretty good battery life2. Connectivity :- I'd say around 10-15 ft, works best with newer ones with newer version of Bluetooth, my Redmi Note 4 loses connectivity faster than my brother's poco F13. comfort :-. Not so great but bearable, occasionally noticable discomfort and ear becomes Sweat Dam on longer use4. Sound :- Pretty much balance and great output . Not too much bass,not too much treble just appropriate for daily use5. Calls :- mic is pretty good and you don't have to scream so that person on other end can hear, just need to speak a little louder than on earpiece, would've loved it if this was improved.Overall, a great dealCons :-1.Super fluctuations in price :- I bought these on prime day deal but the price other times is fluctuating fast, best would be to but when around 1200/- odd . If budget is 1500 might as well but mi sports wireless earphones .2. Could've improved on comfort.3. If you break the support rubber ,there's no replacement"

Zero noice cancellation,3.0,"Purchased around 4 months back. Sound quality and Bass is superb. Battery back up is great. No issue in connectivity.But, I have only one complaint.. its noice cancellation is almost zero. I mean, we can hear the clock ticking sound also if we are talking in a room. And if its noisy background, u can't talk at all.. it amplifies noice sounds rather controlling.."
Excellent sound-stage at this price point.,4.0,Having owned multiple high end earphones I decided to buy a cheaper one for daily usage. I settled down with this after doing some research.  I would say the sound quality is above average. Excellent sound stage with decent noise cancellation. When I first tired them on the voice prompt literally scared me lol. Built quality is also good but the wire length is big for me. I can connect to two devices seamlessly. I feel bass is little overpowered. Bought this for Rs.999 and it exceeds my expectation.
Excellent audio performance üëå,5.0,Considering the price point it has to be one of the best among all the other bluetooth earphone.Seamless bluetooth connectionAudio quality is upto the markDesign is goodBattery backup is ExcellentOverall its a product which u can buy without any doubt.
fake product,1.0,when we go for service center then find out this is fake productcomplaint to amazon but no reply from amazon
"Overall review of this ""Bluetooth Earphone"" boAt Rockerz 255.",4.0,"I just want to tell you guys go for it. As I purchased @999 only.( It's not good for gaming. )( But good for playing videos, listening  musics/songs. )*Noise Cancellation*Its noise cancelation is awesome it cancel all the outer sound & stops reaching to our ears which prevents the internal musics/songs from outer noise, which we were listening.*Bluetooth Connectivity*Once you connect to your device & after that whenever you will try to connect,  it will connects in a second only. Connectivity is too fast.*Sound Quality*As I see its sound is not so clear just because of its high bass but not too bad also. When you play music it is good but while playing online multi-player games some time voice is not so clear it feels like heavy sound is initiated through it. Bass is too good.*Some More Info*It has three buttons on right side of bands: Upper button [ + ],  Middle Button [ O ], Down Button [ - ] & a charging port respectively.Upper button is used to increase the volume by just a click & to play the next/upcoming musics/songs press it for few second.Middle button is used to power on or off by pressing it for few seconds & also used to control Google Assistant by pressing it for few seconds which which should be less than its power on or off timing.Down button is similarly used to down the volume by just a click & to play the previous musics/songs by pressing it for few seconds.At last I want to say overall it is good product & purchase it without any hesitation at this price ‚Çπ999. Actually the cost of this product is about ‚Çπ1499.Thanks!"
Investing on my first pair of blutooth earphones,5.0,"Got these mainly for my gym sessions.Build: 4/5Battery: 3.5/5Sound Quality: 4/5 (good bass)Connectivity: 3.5/5The build quality is pretty good and sturdy.The battery level is displayed on the phone once connected which helps me know when I have to charge it.The battery life is also fair enough, you can use it for a good 3-4 hours listening to music at 40-60% Volume.But once the battery level reaches 20%, the battery will last no longer than 15 minutes. Generally, if you see a phone's battery, it drains out slower when it's below 15%.If you do use it at max volume, I'm sure you won't be hear anything but the music, so if that's ""Noise Cancellation"", then it does a good job because these earphones are really loud!Overall a good product from the price point and sound quality point of view.Happy Shopping! :)"
Please Dont Purchase this Waste of Money,1.0,Battery Backup Not good I had issues with Battery performance it last for me about 1.5 hour in continuous Usage.. And If You are Bass Lover then only go For that Audio Quality  Isn't Great And at Some Point of Time After Cointnues listening You might feel pain in Your Ears.. I Would Advice not to Go with this Product don't Purchase and i am Reviewing it after 11 days of continues usage.. I am Sending it back In return Not Satisfied disappointed with This.
Only for music... Not for calling.,2.0,"Pros : decent sound quality and great bass.Good for gym and jogging/runningBattery backup is decent enoughBluetooth range is decentConsNot at all for calls.It catches lots of surrounding sound.. much more than caller's voiceInitially though,t may be defective piece... Tested it all possible way with 3 different pieces.but for every piece the same issue...."
Not Expected this shit from Boat,1.0,"Bought Boat Rockerz 255 pro+The Boat headphones are so hyped.I thought of giving it a try.Problems I faced -1. battery getting dropped to 80% directly from 100% ( middle percentage does not show2. multiple bluetooth device connection issue.3. stopped working and charging within 1 week of use - replaced again.4. after replacement - bluetooth not connecting with multiple device.5. audio stops working frequently.Please add 200-300 Rs more, and buy some Other brands."
battery & magnet,4.0,this is nice product & the battery is super- lasting 3days  of normal usage.But I felt headache & discomfort to wear this for 6 hours continuously. That could be possibly because of the magnetic earbuds  or its weight due to magnets.Choice is yours to buy magnetic or non magnetic earbuds Bluetooth neckband.everything has its pros & cons
Awesome sound quality but....,3.0,"Everything is good, sound quality is awesome, look wise also decent but.....But battery life is bad, if you consider it for using a whole day battery may end up just before your day ends. Backup of 6-7 hours is not enough for a whole day use. If you want something with good battery life jabra elite 25e is what you are looking for but something with good sound quality this is what you are looking for but if you want both this thing in one, then sorry there is no such thing available i have searched and watched each and every earphones review but this technology seems to be failing you can even see that very few wireless mouse and keyboard have good ratings."
Issue in 225 Pro model. Don't buy 255 PRO.,1.0,"I think boat has now started ignoring regarding quality check. I have ordered this product,  at day 1 I found issue in dual connectivity & after that device goes automatically in switch off mode but in device I t shows connected. I request for replacement. When the replacement came the same issue was in it & it was so irritating. May be the issue is in PRO model of boat 255 because I have used 255 sports active black for 1.5 years n it performed fantastic n so rough n tough but this PRO model having so much issues ..Don't buy 255 PRO.."
Not recommended for people who switch between two devices regularly.,3.0,"I don't recommend this product for people who doesn't care about their headphones much as I don't think this can be roughly used.Cons :- It's not C-type charging and the charging port doesn't seems to be well build.- Switching between two devices not easy.Even after purchasing this, I'm using my onepluse bullets all the time coz of the comfort and easy switching. Still I'm giving 3 star for the sound and price of the product."
"Works good, sound is okay, pains your ear after sometime",3.0,"Does the work for portable music listening. Needs a quiet place for the mic to work, it isnt great and I never use it for calls. Base is quite high and pains your ear after and hour of listening. If you get this around 1000 bucks, take it for a portable experience otherwise invest on a good wired in-ear Sennheiser which u get below 1500 and gives the best audio output"
Value for money,4.0,The sound quality and build quality is pretty good. What I disliked about the product for which I have given 4 star to it is the length of the cord. It's a bit lengthy compared to Boat Rockerz 255 or 235 series.But overall a value for money product.
Not durable,3.0,"Went for this as I have previously used boat handphones. But this product disappointed me. The headphone tip broke within 1 month of use.Got this for Rs.900 in the sale.Pros:Good soundCons:1.Bluetooth connectivity issue. If kept in lower jean pocket, sometimes the connectivity drops and its very irritating.2. Poor Quality.3. The headphone tip easily breaks due to poor design."
Good value for money.,4.0,"<Pros>* Rich bass* Good built quality* Magnetic lock* Nice grip over neck*Good company service (had to replace it because of faulty charging)<Cons/>*Dont leave the charging cap open because sweat can get in through it and damage the charging...*Detailed review*Boat Rockerz 255 bluetooth in-ear headset is a very good quality product. It has a very rich bass and nooce cancellation is also pretty good. Accessories like ear buds of different sizes and charging cable are provided. If you workout and sweat alot then make sure to keep tha charging cap closed because if sweat goes through it then it may damage the charging, the charging stopped working after 2 weeks so i had to replace it..and the company service was amazing it took around 10 days and then i got a replaced piece back with extra accessories..*Conclusion*I would really recomend this, this headset provide a very good value for money.PS- Just dont walk while using it..because the noice cancellation will not let u hear anything else and it may cause an accident.."
Not amazing not pathetic,4.0,"Bluetooth connectivity is good, sound quality is average. You can live with it I bought it to answer calls without picking up my phone. Not for songs or gym or driving. So it's okay for me.Battery backup is above average.One con which tips me off often is that the ear buds are pretty heavy. So a single tap on the chord and it comes out of the ear. But as I said, you can live with it. Not bad."
Its good for gaming,4.0,I would recommend for gaming. I dont like the audio for music. I use my jabra 65t instead. The audio is not that pleasing but the low latency while gaming is really good for this price. The battery backup is just mind boggling.
Devesh Shyngle Genuine Reviews,5.0,"After months of research of which bluetooth earphone to buy, I decided to go for these and it was all worth it.I'm a base loving person and I will say if you like base-y sound/music these are the earphones for you.Battery life is really good, gets charged in an hour or so. Completely satisfied with this product.Recommended by me."
If i had option to return now.. i would have returned,3.0,"Good things :Battery is good,Sound is good too for the price,Bass is good but not what i wanted..Bad things :Mic isn't that good.. im having problem while calling..Rubber tips are Hard, i can't wear them for much long.. 15 -20 mins max. ( pro tip : i plugged my old Mi wired headphones rubber tips to these headphones, problem solved for me ),Sound & Bass quality could have been better"
Battery is awesome,4.0,"Pros : - Battery Backup is awesome - The sound quality is good (Not too heavy or too light, feels good) - Light Weight (Expected from Bluetooth Headphones)Cons : - Bluetooth connectivity takes variable time. Sometimes it connects as soon as it is ON. Other times, it takes a couple of minutes - The multi device connect is gimmicky and not very seamless. I got it to work with a mac and an iPhone - Mic is not very sensitive and may not be suitable for speaking while traveling"
"Useless product, battery life is too low barely 3 hours",1.0,"I made a mistake buying this item. It hardly gives 2 hours for a promised upto 6hrs. That is just half of it. Once full charged I checked it, but after two hours battery is dead. The sound quality is average, built quality is decent but the battery is too bad. I am thinking of replacing a new one."
Good at first but now I'm facing connectivity issues,3.0,"Let's get the initial review out of the way.Package arrived on time and packing was good as usual.I've been using these for almost 2 months now. The sound quality is good.For the past few weeks I'm facing connectivity issues. I tried using different phones but had the same problem. The headphones keep disconnecting at random moments when I'm on call with someone. Either a normal voice call or VOIP like whatsapp. However, this doesn't happen while listening to music."
Disappointed,3.0,Been 2 months since I bought it. The left side stopped working gradually and now the volume has became so low..Guess it‚Äôs better to opt for better branded products at similar price!There is literally no service centre in Bangalore for this product. Travelled like 13 kms to a place which looks more then a residential home then a service centre.. and only be told to register online as services are only done in Mumbai. Better not buy from Bangalore for convenience sake. üôÑ
Boat Rokerz review,5.0,Sound-4.5/5Build quality-4.5/5Battery life -4/5Earphone's quality is good with strong magnetic lock... Straps are of good quality the  wires are too good. Buttons quality is good.. sound is full of punchy bass and and balanced treble and has sorrund effect.Comfortable in ears connectivity is good..It has features of latest bluetooth 4.1 Version.The best part is 10 minutes of charging can work around for an hourOverall it's worth the price. I recommend all of you to go for it
Not Good for music and i also not received extra earmuff in exchange. its really disappointing.,1.0,"After I used product I found bass is very heavy and not able to manage and sound is distorting, not balance with treble. You can hear your own voice like humming while talk which is ridiculous.. n for music it's big no. Battery like is good. Give 20 Rs extra and buy from original BOAT so if you don't like you can return. For music its waste of money. and conical buds gives pain not able to used more than 5 min. Its even not stay fit in my ear. its fell down. its really worst. Never buy from amazon as no option to return only exchange. better buy from Boat official side."
Expected much better than this.,3.0,"It's not what I expected it to be. Bass is Flat no such bass , noise cancellation is okay. During call bluetooth doesn't work so you might reconnect and re-think of buying it. Earbuds won't stick to ears if you're running or doing HIIT workout. Normal walk or gym for that it's good. Not bad. Overall rating 2.5/5."
"BAD MIC, made in china, waste of money",1.0,"‚àÜ  Pick up more background noise, people from other side of phone complain about my voice low,and background noise more. Even in room anyone is talking in a low voice, the other person over phone thinking its a crowd.‚àÜ  Made in China.Thinking about return, bt there is only option of replacement.After replacement same problem..finally got return option.I got relieved."
My review after using it for 3 month.,4.0,"Bass is good it has active Noise cancellation audible on roads also.I get to enjoy loud crisp and clear musicIt can connect two devices at a time so pairable with mobile and laptop together is a huge advantage.With a full charge, i get more or less 8 hours of battery lifeconnects easily without wasting time with my mobile phone."
"Very poor bass quality, very low volume.",1.0,"I bought this item, just because of the number of reviews displayed for this product. I have used with my MI Redimi Note 7 Pro mobile. I was so disappointed with the qulaity of the sound. First of all, the volume is very low even though at maximum volume kept. The bass effect is also very poor. Totally disappointed with the product.I need to return this item, I want complete refund."
Microphone not working,1.0,"This product are only battery backup and average bass is good other all off very bad. Microphone not working during call. Hisssssing sound hear in background.This product is very bad quality. When I took the first time, multifunction botton defective I replaced it's.second time microphone not working Now I have a placed refund order,"
Just don't buy this product.,2.0,"This is totally worth less to buy headphone like this, very uncomfortable dimensionally while adjusting into the ear & lot of connectivity issues through out the bluetooth while continuing on call as well as videos. Not that much good in terms of sound quality and other things, likewise they don't have replacement options so that customer can go for a better one, I would suggest just don't buy this product. I am the custoner of Amazon since years however the very first time I am very disappointed with Amazon."
SuperDuperAwesome,5.0,"Value for money . I bought it for 999‚Çπ in lightening deal.Bass is fantastic feels like home theatre sound.Sound quality as expected, was looking for something to atleast reach my iphones earphones .. and this is exact what I wanted.Noise cancellation is superb.Light weight. Look wise Porsche, rich look.Easy access. Siri to working with this hps.Ear bud magnet it very nice.In love with this product , planning to order 1 more for my sister."
"Good design, but average audio quality, medium bass",3.0,"Pros:1. Design2. Build3. Tactile buttons easily perceived by touchCons:1. Medium bass which sounds not natural2. BT connectivity range is not more than 3 meters. After that it goes on-off-on-off (breaks & reconnects)3. Audio quality is not very greatIf you are a bass lover, I would recommend Portronics Harmonics at same price but at less design quality."
Good but not the best!,3.0,Sound quality is good compared to other similar products. Provides sufficient bass for an in-ear headphone. Fast charging really works well. Very lightweight and tangle free cable.Bluetooth connectivity is not very fast.The audio prompt on switching on and switching off the device is extremely loud and annoying. It will be much better if they removed it altogether.Earbuds are metallic and heavy so bit uncomfortable but u get used to it.Magnets at the back aren't really of any use even for cable management.Workmanship is poor. The cover on charge port won't work properly after sometime. The housing of the battery and controls is loosely fit so not watertight.
Extremely good sound quality although not by default but through an Equalizer,5.0,"Sound:Excellent sound quality. Although the default sound is more bass kind and I love a balanced Vocal+Treble+Bass so I had to manually configure my EQUALIZER. So either learn to use an Equalizer which enhances the sound quality to a great extent or if you like bass and heavy sound then default settings are fine.Battery:Lasts good enough.Very convenient, durable and flexible. Good call quality butNot suitable for long time listening, the grip hurts a bit in earOverall great. If you want some new features like bt 5.0, usb C then go for something else. And yes it's MADE IN CHINA!"
Waste of Money to purchase this,1.0,"I am trying to use it for calls. But there is too much noise and other person is not getting my voice. So I think waste of money to purchase this. I can connect this device to two platform computer or mobile. But there will be noise while using it. Within a month it's stopped working now. Useless product, Please don't purchase it. It's stopped charging now. You have to disconnect one device then you can take the call."
Ideal for listening to music & running!,4.0,"--- Reviewing after 2 months of use ---Very happy with the boAt Rockerz 255 Sports Bluetooth Wireless Earphone.Pros- Sporty look and feel- Great audio quality.- Pairs seamlessly with two simultaneous devices. Used it with my mobile and laptop.- Has decent battery life.- Fits perfectly in the bowl of the ear making it suitable for running as well.- Well priced.Cons:- If you are taking calls on both your mobile and laptop (VoIP), then the mobile always take precedence and interrupts the call on the laptop. I generally ended up disconnecting my mobile before getting on a call from my laptop. Not really an issue if you are only listening to music on your laptop.- Ear clip felt a bit hard in the first few days so couldn't keep it in ear for more than an hour or two.- Ear clip can become loose and fall off.Would I buy it again?Most likely"

Distracted Bass Quality,3.0,"I like the Bass quality . But having Helerious trreble quality . If u Like good punchy bass then go for it . It will not disappoint you any way . 1. Pros : 1.a. Good battery ( Highlighted Feature ) 1.b. Good Bass . 1.c. Have seperated button for mic and controls.  2. Cons: 2.a. Have Latancy issue while gaming. If u r planing to buy this product for gaming purpose it will dissatisfied you. , cause it has some delay sound problem . 2.b. Mic response is not up to the mark . 2.c. Meterial Quality is Cheap .. ... Otherwise OK .product"
Poor sound quality for video calling,1.0,"Don't know what went wrong with it. Its ""boAt"". I guess bluetooth technology is not working that properly. There was lot disturbing sound in between. Not at all good for video calling apps like zoom and google meet. The other side people were not able to hear properly.Had already ordered one and then replaced. But found same problem with this one also... so finally returned."
After sales service,3.0,"After sales service of Boat is very bad. My piece stopped charging and when I went for replacement to one of the service center in Bengaluru, they said charging port is damaged. However, I used to plug and unplug the same way I do for my phone which never got damaged. This means the charging port Boat uses is of worst quality. There was no mention of how to plug/unplug charger and hence Boat should have replaced it. Completely disappointed with the product manufacturer."
Bluetooth  won't work properly,2.0,"Honest feedback after 6 months usage.1. Left hearing totaly gone bad..it worked for first 3-4 months, later it's not working..I have to visist service center to get it fixed.2. Some times buletooth won't work. I have to disconnect and keep reconnecting..3. Based on many reviews only I purchased.. but not really that great product.."
NOT TO BUY. WASTE OF MONEY,1.0,"I DONT KNOW WHETHER I RECEIVED GENUINE PRODUCT OR NOT. WHENEVER I PUT IT ON, IT SAYS 'WELCOME TO NIRVANA'. NOW I DONT KNOW WHAT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN BOAT & NIRVANA. FURTHER, IT DISCONNECTS MOST OF THE TIME WHILE YOU ARE TALKING ON PHONE. THIS IS THE MOST PATHETIC THING. CONNECTIVITY IS VERY BAD. ACTUALLY BLUETOOTH RECEIVER IS ON RIGHT SIDE OF THE EARPHONE & IF YOU PUT YOUR PHONE ON YOUR LEFT SID-E, IT WILL DISCONNECT. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE FOR VERY HIGH PRICE. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR APPROX.  18-20 DAYS. FURTHER, IT TRANSMITS VERY LOW VOICE TO THE PERSON WHO IS TALKING TO YOU ON PHONE. BATTERY BACK UP IS GOOD. WASTE OF MONEY"
Worst product.,1.0,"Dear all users or future users , I would like to share important feedback about this product .Negative point -I bought this product on 10th feb and I used this only 15days and now it is not working. Suddenly it was stop working while I am on call.I though it was discharged but actually it was product failure. Now it also not taking charging also.Positive point-Good sound qualityGood connectivityGood voice clearance during call.Over and all I will give zero points , if product is not working then positive point doesn't work.Now I want to change this product under warranty but doesn't find any path to return this.Pls suggest how to return the product."
"Perfect,  very good, genuine product.  Thanks Amazon",5.0,"As usual,  products from Amazon and associated teams are always perfect.Same thing is applicable for this product,  on time, durable, quality checked, got at less cost  as ordered during Festival deals.Thanks to Amazon team, delivery team and all other associatesHappy And Prosperous Dipavali !"
Issue with Mac Air.,4.0,"So I used it for a while and really loved the quality of the product. The sound is crisp and loud which is best. The battery backup is amazing! I really loved it. But recently I realize that when I connect to my Mac Air, it shows that it's connected but the audio still plays in my Mac (Works perfectly fine on mobiles though). The replace date has expired and now I cannot do anything. I hope I get some good response from the seller."
Great product,5.0,"Unbeaten at this price,comfortable for use on runs and while exercising ,though increased usage of more than an hour a day can cause pain in the ears.Decent sound quality.The semi hard neck band though is a little irritating"
Hopeless Upgrade !!!!,1.0,"Dear Viewers,Highly advisable to not to opt these earphones as an alternative to Boat Rockerzz 255 Sportz.Hopeless upgrade and extremely disappointing when such renowned brand is floating such kind of product.From Day 3, microphone malfunctioned.Contacted the customer support team and sought for replacement.The new device is having bluetooth connectivity issues and no option to replace or return the product.Not at all recommendable.The preceding versions are great...."
Great product...,5.0,This is an awesome product you can get at this price range...nice bass and you will love it...at max level you can feel little bit distortion but that's not a big deal... and if you talk about about gaming there is very negligible latency and it's like nothing...I was curious about products originality but it seems gunine one...it's my first day with this product and I will update in next 2 weeks about its reliability...I got it in just 999/-
Disappointed with sound and bass,3.0,I am using boat from last 5 years but as compared to boat basshead 225 this model is very low in rating of sound and bass and price difference is big. Sound quality is bad so bad not at all impressive as compared to basshead225. Didn't liked it. Boat is mostly famous for bass but this ome is like china Bluetooth headphones i wish i cud return it and buy another one i can pay more but i need amazing bass which i guess comes from upper versions like 255 pro amd above that..... So honest review dont buy it for 1200 not at all worth of you are looking for bass and sound ... I am disappointed #boat
"It's a Substantiall wireless earphone to buy,",1.0,It's average quality of wireless earphones. There were some issues like not connecting with device and some static sound sometimes but they were ok to use for 8 months. After 8 months there are majour problems like battery daining fast and one side of earphone not working.
Defective products and poor quality,1.0,"BoAT rockerz 255, was poor quality make and suspect not really authentic brand. Issue was that left ear piece making some irritation noise, request for replacement and 2nd which is received is horrible. It doesn't detect range as per recommended (10m) but it not able to work with 1 metre.  I have to keep mobile less than 1/2 metre to get clarity sound. Poor bluetooth connectivity, poor performance and unhappy with brand.#Who knew Amazon offers may selling all defective products at cheap price so people can buy blindly!! It may be one of the strategic planning to clearance of damaged or defective products.Juz waste of my time! Unhappy"
Decent earphones,4.0,"I have been using boat 255f for last 2 years. I thought 255pro+ will be a much better upgrade. It is infact better than 255f on terms of connectivity, battery, quick charge. Sound is almost same. The only drawback that I can clearly say is the buttons are poorly placed. There's a whole other inline button set on the right side which increases the weight and that feels odd and might start hurting your right ear. It is really unconvinient during workout too. But if your are just looking for good earphones for using at home and without much movement, then go for it."
Waste of Money.,1.0,"first one stopped working within 10 days but likely I got replacement for that.  After seven month, it has stopped working for both the ears, wire quality is very bad.  Only one service center in Pune which is also very far away from my home, I did register its complaint using Boat's official website but it is hopeless.  I would suggest you to go for any other brand but not for boat.Amazon it will be great if you have NO start option as well for these types of cheap products."
King of BAAAAAASSSSS!!!,5.0,Impressed with this product. This one has got a lot of BAAAAAASSSSS. So if you like to burn your ears for some beats. Go for it!Battery back up is decent. 6 hours in high volume)(not recommended) and 10 hours for a decent level volume and sometimes more than 10 hrs üòäGrip is really nice. Sticks to ears properly. The charger that we get along with the headset is a nice product. Chargers quickly in about 20 mins charge for 3 hrs playback time. Cooooool isn't??? üí™Thank you Boat alias Nirvana!
Mic not audible to other while speaking,1.0,The mic is not clear.. no one is able to hear me clearly. I have to disconnect and talk directly via mobile. Wats the use?Need a new replacement... Just rec'd yesterday but now happy as my friends too have purchased boat headset from Amazon but product was great and no disturbance... Can listen and talk clearly...I know boat has good brands don't know how not happy purchasing this one. Please help ...
Not worth,3.0,"Do not buy this. Go for zebronics journy instead. That is much more value for money product. There are three cons as per my usage:When to turn on this bluetooth it will connect with all the mobile devices it was paired earlier. So u r listening two diffrent songs from two phones inthe same headphone at the same time...Second it has three buttons n two humps on both side of buttons. So if u are using this headphone on bike ride, which i do n u r wearing gloves. U will end up pressing wrong button.Third it created problem with samsung phone as it was not appearing in the available devices...Though sound quality of this headphone is very good.."
The product sucks,1.0,This is my 2nd product that I have purchased with boat. Both stopped working. This one lasted for 40 days. The customer service is designed in a way that you don't get your product or wait for a decade for replacement. Too many processes to follow. Would recommend to burn that cash but not buy this.
"Excellent product, but stopped working after six months of usage.",5.0,"Pros:lightweightmutifuntional buttonsgood sound qualityuser friendlystylishdecent batterycan connect two devices simultaneouslyGood noise cancellationTells who's calling if feature activated in phoneCons:low bluetooth range (works well within same room)magnetic earphones don't pause musiclittle too much basswhile using two connected devices, without manually pausing the first device, we can't hear the second deviceBottomline: Cons are nitpicked. I bought it for rs 899 during sale. Overall it is a great product for the price and i am very satisfied with it.Update: one side stopped working after six months of usage. Also a few weeks before that, i was having trouble charging it due to the rusted charging port. So reliability is an issue here, although i can't ask too much for 899 rupees.I must say that the service experience is exceptional. Amidst the lockdown, my damaged earphones was picked up from my village, and the replacement earphones right after a month. Really impressed by the service. I recommend boat due to its service and warranty."
Pathetic after sales service,1.0,Terrible mistake in buying this product. Became non functional within one month of purchase. Warranty available for 6 months. Being denied to me by the manufacturer.One of the worst after sales service ever. Hate to admit. But the people telling me not to buy an Indian product for this very reason suddenly seem right. Cheats trying to swindle their customers for a quick buck with no aim or plan for long term sustainability.
Over powering BASS,3.0,"'Rockerz' is known for BASS but it is overpowering on other frequencies. Instrumental is muffled.But most of listeners enjoy due to heavy BASS. Noise cancellation is 100% completely block external noise.Eartips are good (not best). Bluetooth ver 4.1 , so works on all latest phones. Bluetooth range is average. No prb. in connectivity."
Durable and Good battery life,5.0,The sound output is great. The built quality 8s also looks good. The battery backup is absolutely phenomenal. The brand is also very reliable. They will provide free pickup if you will face any problem within the warranty period. I got this product at 999/- only üòå
Good experience for music lover at this price range,5.0,Good Headphone for music lover but if you buy it for watching movie then go for another option. Bass is really good which makes your music experience better but you will miss lower tone and mid tone when watching movies. Low vocal and high bass suffer you in movie experience. When we need high vocal and low base at movie. Its high base and instrumental tone suppress the vocal of movie.. Battery backup is good. You can get 6-7 hours battery backup easily and takes 1.5 hours full charge.
Earphones not suitable with pubg,4.0,"Everything is is perfect but if you are buying this earphones for playing games ""pubg"" dont buy these earphones because there is a delay of sound for about one second and that really effects our game play but for calls and videos or songs these earphones are perfect at the price i got it for 899 InrReview after 6 monthsleftside of the earphone stopped working but after i visited the service center i got a replacement within 10 minutes no extra question were asked"
This is my genuine review giving after 6 months of use..,3.0,"1) When it comes to the SOUND QUALITY at this price segment no other brand can beat this, no doubt in it and bass is reasonable may be I felt like this because I used some other better sony earphones I didn't found that bass in this but there's a 1500Rps difference for that and this earphones so that doesn't need to consider this as a majer issue at this price rate the bass and the sound quality is great.2) Let's talk about the BUILD QUALITY , Quality of this product looks unbeatable but after six months of use , female input charge port is gone inside but I tried to pull out and charge,  later I found that it was damaged internally . Internal female input port was separated from the Motherbord.. now i'm not sure whether I can clime the warranty or not have to find out after this covid-19 lockdown.3) CONNECTIVITY, in the beginning after I bought , the connectivity Is pretty cool but later I found issue in switching with the other devices it takes time but it connects, Anyways That's not a big deal it connects just in sometimes it'll take like 5-10 mins while switching devices."
Highly recommended,4.0,"It's a stunning and tremendous headset at this price, moreover, it has good bass and sound quality is astonishing and melodious. The most important advantage of this product is its battery backup. I plug in this once in a blue moon but I get remarkable battery backup, even though It is being used by me for a long time regularly. I must say that above everything else the battery backup is the thing which was loved by the most out of this product."
"Headphones are like hookers, you get what you pay for.. Don't expect Studio level features",4.0,"Good quality for the price. Haven't used while doing sports yet. Its been long since I used bluetooth headphones, have been using the wired ones from senheiser, bose and other brands, the good thing with this one is, I can connect to my phone and laptops at the same time, it pauses the videos on laptop when I get a phone call on my mobile. I think that is cool. And with the noise cancelling part, this one doesn't do a job on that part unless you keep volumes at very high levels to get you a headache. The sound quality is good for the price range. Nothing more on that. Bluetooth connectivity is pretty good, within 5 - 7 meters I guess, more than that there is distortion, noise and all the other wave range related problems. Buy this if you just need some good quality headphones for 6 - 8 months of usage."
Low cost but high value,5.0,"One of the best boAt earphones. I have been using boAt for two years and I found their services to be very very impressive. The audio quality is very good. The music feels amazing. Bass is also good compared to other boAt products.However, one problem is that there is latency in audio while you are playing a game. I played PUBG using these earphones and there was a mismatch between audio and the action performed in the game. If you are a gaming freak and plays a lot of game such as PUBG, Asphalt, COD, or any other game where audio is everything then don't buy bluetooth devices. Go for wired one, they will perform far better. Hope you will find this review helpful!"
Best Quality sounds with Best battery back,5.0,It is Best product of boat with very high quality sound. When you play music with full volume you just fill dj sound around you. This product have Long lasting battery back up  I just use continue last 7 days without charging and charging is very fast when you charge it 10 mint only you play continue 12 hours. It's work with google voice and shree with good controller.  So I hope it is best ones product by boat so buy it if you want best sounds with higher battery back
I will review it honestly for who all are reading this review,3.0,I read many good and bad reviews for this product and I brought it now I will review it honestly for who all are reading this review1.My product box is fully damage and reworked the box it's like some one used it but the product is fine.2.The sound clarity is good only for music with extraordinary bass in it but not for movie and YouTube videos.3.Noise cancellation is not good at all it's waste I still here background noise4.Not a great fit for workout session because due to sweat it's run out of ear and the magnetic lock is not locking perfectly when we unplugged in ear5.its has a good battery life like there said solidly 5:30-6 hrs and it's charge time is 1:30hrsThat's it everything I about this earphones.
Not recommended copy products of boAt.,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†It's copy of BoAt product. Sound quality is like Rs 50 headphones, bass quality is less than Rs 50 headphones... It's really not expecting from this seller.. boAt is very strong Brand of sound quality. But this headphones are really copy of boAt and has not recommended. I was showing the each part of images .. lookwise from box to internal all parts it's not like boAt product. Highly dissatisfied."
"It is a semirigid neck band, not a fully wire type of headphones",4.0,"This is a semi rigid neck band with hanging wires from both ends. This was never mentioned in the description. Was looking for a full wire type earphones which can be conveniently carried in pocket. Long wires hanging down from tip of neck band reaches near ur umbilicus, kind of odd looking. Voice clarity is just ok. Clarity of the music is not exactly reproduced."
Excellent Sound Quality...Value for Money!,5.0,Writing this review after using boAt 225 wireless headset and JBK t160BT...I must say that boAt has got excellent bass and sound quality compared to JBL one.Superb sound quality and built. Very comfortable in ears. Value for Money!!!
Did not work as per the features mentioned on the description and got damaged soon.,1.0,"Bought these hoping for a good experience, but then faced many issues. The product didn't connect to more than 1 devices at a time, the sound quality was not good, the charging got over in like 2-3 hours after a full charge and the mic wasn't working at times.And adding to all these, the right side of the product stopped working automatically within a month.I am still trying to get a replacement but apparently my invoice has been rejected once and the BoAt site is irresponsive right now.Not a very good product, please buy at your own risk."
Wowwww excellent battery backup.,5.0,"Wowwww excellent battery backup, i received today mrng, used 2hrs but still 100% charging, sound quality also superb, i got it for just 899, thank you so much üòä"
Okey,1.0,"Sound is okay , noise cancellation is very poor ,other voice disturb on phone call and battery life is also okey , All time show full battery n sadan battery 30% , I don't know maybe I'm wrong but that is my 5 day experience n I'm not happy"
Terrific purchase,4.0,After using it for a couple of months I'm totally satisfied with the sound quality in this budget. Definitely worth a purchase.Don't expect sony's quality and bass but overall nice product in this range.Update after almost 11 months of usage:Battery is starting to discharge quickly now. Sound quality is also little degraded but the main issue is with battery.
not good for long term,3.0,"i am using this product for last 1 year.its back up , sound , performance was good initially.in 2 months its backup reduced and started giving 3 hrs backup.in 6 months one side stopeed workingin 9 months earbuds got teared.in 1 year sounds started cracking wth 1 hour backup & range of less than 5 feet.now i cant use as the voice keep on breaking while using .max productive life of this product is 6 months ."
Boat customer service is really very very bed,1.0,"Earphone Is good I am just not satisfied with Boat customer service. Last 2 months my earphone is with them for service as one of its not working since it was in warranty they picked up my earphone 2 months ago still no one reply from them,no one pick call in customer care I can understand lockdown situation but it's 2 months now all services started but Boat customer care is no even respondingSince last two months I'll try to connect them but only computer generated automatic replyReally very bad no one give me idea that when I'll receive my earphone back.Please note I can understand lockdown situation but atleast they have respond on call or massage me about status of serviceNothing"
Review after 1 week usage,4.0,Pros: I got this one for 999 INR as a prime day deal. The sound clarity and bass is nice. Fits perfectly in the ear. Can't get any better one at this price. Connectivity is okay and working perfectly while talking too.Cons: Long wire (which may not be a problem for many).I would recommend this to my friends. Hope this review helps.
Review after use of 2 months,3.0,After using of 2 months-Good things-Sound quality is good enoughEven bass is also goodFast chargingBad things-Build quality not so goodBattery backup poorWhen you use this for only music then it gives around 5-6 hours battery backup but if you go for call or zoom (online class) then it gives 1.30 - 2 hours.But the main thing the company shows that it will take around 1 hours to get full charge but when i used this product it took only 30-35 mins for full charge.
Poor Quality,1.0,"While hearing songs it was stuck often...there was problem in bluetooth..whenever try change songs or increase volume though boat device, songs getting stuck,there was some disturbance..so i returned it..amazon replaced to me another device but that too doesn't work.. Tried to put charging for more than 2hrs but battery remains 10percent, not increasing morethan that... It was working only when connected with charger..if plugged off,  stopped working... Had bad experience..please try to change the dealer..."
Not Satisfied,1.0,"For first couple of months the earphone was excellent n I have referred it to many office colleagues .Later one side of it wasn't working whenever there was low battery, thought it would be some technical issue and I've kept for charging in that caseBut now it's totally stopped working n I'm unable to reach out to Boat Support on this ."
Durable!! Using it for last 7 months,5.0,Durability is amazing! Boat as expected delivered a good product.Speakers and both earbuds are functioning well even after rough use.Charging stands upto 24 hrs even if on continuously.!A negative is pathetic noise cancellation!
Not good,3.0,"I have been using this product for 2 months now. First time it got charged in 1¬Ω hours. Second time the red light didn't turn to green even after chargin for 2¬Ω hours. Since then the battery percentage turns100% but the red light never changes to green. Also, the battery percentage decrease with 20%. Example: 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and the device starts giving battery low warning at 20% and switches off within 2-3 minutes. Few days back one of the ear support got lose and it came off today. 100% Comfortable but overall product performance is not upto the mark."
Best in under 2000rs price range,5.0,"The sound is good, bass is good too as per price ,its clear and doesnt cause irritation. The connectivity is good in between devices and playing media from connected devices is flawless. Its multifunctionality make its much prior choice among its price range. Calls are clear and do provide noise cancellation. Battery life is humangous it goes for atleast 35hrs and as per my usage it goes for 4 days without charging. Moreover boat's customer service is excellent. That's what make a company and its product a reliable one."
"Great product , Poor after sales service",4.0,I'm reviewing this product after using it for 6 months. Let me tell you the pros and cons:-Pros:-1) Great bass2) Great product design3) Easy controls.4) Easy to use5) Fluent connectivity6) Best price(Buy it under 1000‚Çπ)7) Great vocalsCons:-1) Too much loud bass2) After sales service poor as compared to other brands.3) 6 hours of battery back upNote:-Replaced the product after 5 months of use. One side wasn't working. Took almost 2 months for replacement. Don't buy for a price tag over 999..
Average Product,3.0,"Iam writing this review after 3months yrrr....It's a good product for Listening Music due to its good base quality and clearity but worst for Calling because of its 0 level of noise cancellation.....You can't believe that if a dog bark at a distance of 500mtr. The person who is on a call with you, can easily listen the barking sound...Overall product is average...."
good one,4.0,"It works fine. Everything is good including battery life.Except..- When I am in call, my friends say they could hear the background noise louder than my voice.- When I watch video, I can notice the significant delay between the video and audio"
Amazing battery but poor range,3.0,"The range is just 5m not more than that else ur audio will brake even if there is a wall between u n the device ur audio brakes, mic is good since close to mouth its working as expected. Have a one plus bullets bass edition, but this lasts long with similar performance"
Loud voice feedback,3.0,"Irritating voice feedback on every action like connecting, disconnection etc. The voice feedback is too loud irrespective to volume level and there is no way to lower it. A subtle beep would be appropriate. I call this a defect and it exists across boat products."
Excellent product,5.0,"Writing this review after several months of using it. This is a great product, very good bass, excellent noise cancellation and the best part is battery back up, it gets full charge in just 45 mins max and you can use it for more than 7 hours, approx. I am very happy with this product. Boat is definitely in the market for something big as it's providing awesome products at very affordable price."
Not worth for money,2.0,"The first one delivered, was not powering on after 3 days. Quick service from Amazon and the replacement was done. The in ear speakers are good and comfortable. The sound quality is good.  The Mic is not good in quality and you need to pull the mic in front of mouth so that people on other side can hear."
Good but you don't mind few things,4.0,Looking good. Nicely designed. Sound is not high compare to others. When you want attend or decline the call you need search for center button. Charging the battery is not easy. Afraid of damaging the type C connector. Once charged it works for 2 to 3 days. Good backup.
Good product! Good sound!,4.0,It's been only one day so I can't rate it 5 star as I need to see how long it will last. From the first feel it seems to be a reasonable product.I was under the impression that the neck band is made up of the wire itself but it's a semi-soft material which looks ok and doesn't cause discomfort. Buds hold well into the ears.
"Great value for money, build quality is great along with sound quality",5.0,"It is simply the best product. Used it for about 1.6 years and only then I faced some issues. I am pretty sure for an average consumer it will last long. Also it's sound quality is exceptional the bass is good and overall a pretty good listening experience microphone is also great and build quality is good for its price battery life is simply amazing it usually lasts about 5 to 6 hours for me when I use it continually for playing pubg, watching movies or listening to music"
I lost trust on boAt product quality,1.0,I dont lik that Bluetooth connectivity of this product its easily lost the connectivity with in 5 to 6 meter even company claim that 10 meter of connectivity and microphone not good opponent Cannot hear voice properly they telling u need to talk loudly even m loudly yelling opponent can hear voice very low amount rather than normal phone talking microphone is worst otherwise may be this product has problems i want original product with proper replacement and dont want defective product again
Indian brand with Chinese quality,1.0,"In short, the product is of inferior quality. Sound quality is low and not good at all. I deferred buying this product twice before I finally purchased in oct 19 after looking at huge sales volume and I think the decision was primarliy driven by good sales vol, less price n instant connect with indian brand but their all components n mfg is China based which is reflecting in their quality. I will surely not going to buy boat product in  years to come until the perception changed."
9 months Review,5.0,I bought this neckband on October 4th..Now right side of the band is not working..It's about to die..1.Good sound quality..Not to expect too much on this price range.2.Worst Noise cancellation.3.Heavy bass4.Perfect battery life..Im using this for past 9months..From day one the battery life is same.Continous usage for 6 to 7 hrs..Normal usage for a day..At the last Oct or 2019 it's worth for money..Bt now they have realme buds and latest OnePlus bullets..
Value for money and daliy office use,4.0,"I was hesitate to Buy after using lg hbs750 but then show entirely changed, use the frist time impressed wll handle small features, ur mobile in DND u get voice messages incoming call pretty cool üòé sound quality good and noise canceling bestTesting 5d songs wearing this u will locw itLast but not least its fit inside the helmet ‚õë"
Fantastic Gift for my Brother,5.0,"I have gifted this earphones to my brother and he is actually very happy with it. He impressed with built quality, length of earphone wire, sound quality and noise cancellation. I can say that in 900 rs i have found a fantastic deal on amazon.Thanks #Boat.. although i really wanted to buy the blue ones but you have not reduced the cost to 999 in sale. No worries, black is also good."
Durable and meets expectations,5.0,"Writing this review after 1.5 years, as came to see how long ago did I bought these and from Feb 2020 to august 2021, the earphones have performed well taking into account the toughness and the falls they have endured as a result of my extra carelessness. So it's a go in the budget earphones but if a higher budget can go for another brand but this works well for an earphone under 1500."
Worst Bluetooth earphone,1.0,"First of all I during call , sound quality is not good and also there is echo and disturbance sound.Secondly for music lover it is not good , I would recommend to go for other earphoneDuring travel signal is getting break.So go for some good quality earphone with some extra money that would be really pleasing for you.I have used it for 11 month and now one side ear is not working"
NEVER PURCHASE BOAT PRODUCTS,1.0,"It's a waste product to get in hyderabadWhen switching off it's telling ""areyy oo sully gaa powering off"" which is rude and unparlimentaryWaste part from boat company...BEWAREReport: Valgur language  Sexual comments  Disrespectful."
Only for listing music bcx have mic issue,2.0,"If u using just for listining music then its good but when u started talking on call using this then another sid3 person unable to hear u, u have to use ur hand to lift the band from neck and keeping near ur mouth to talk someone over call..... In short this devic3 have mic issue... I was changed this device two time because first device have some issue but when complny replaced device then i found this device also work as same that device was..."
Connecting two devices at a time is another level crappy,2.0,"Everything is great, the sound quality, noise cancellation and the bass quality is ok as well, but hate the connectivity issue. I mean you've provided an option to connect two devices at a time, but the fact that if you're watching something on the laptop and then you close that window and then start another video on your phone you'll spend the next millenium to reset it so that you are able to listen to it, no matter how many times I restart the device doesn't help. I would have liked it better if they just didn't give this option. I mean what's the use if you're not able to use it properly, and wasting more time to reset, it would've been easier to shut one device's bluetooth and connect."
Boat Rockerz pro plus,3.0,The only major thing is battery backup. Continuous connecting with my mobile getting 3 days backup.  Comparing to other companiea in this price range call quality also good.  Audio quality also good.  Don't expect morethan this price range like anc.  High bass etc.....
One of the best Bluetooth earphones in the market.,3.0,"I loved the product. At start I was reluctant to use it bcoz I was using realme wireless earphones and shifting to this Earphone was a little bit hard for me. But when I got used to it, I started loving the product. It can connect simultaneously with 2 devices. I have been using it for 3 months now and as of I haven't faced any issues with it, neither with the sound quality, nor with the mic. Bass and noise cancellation could have been better, but at this price one cannot really complain."
Okay okay product,4.0,Sound quality is ok not that great. Also noice cancellation is also not upto the mark. I found the boat in ear wired headphones much better. Can't say about the battery life since I don't used earphones that much. If getting it below 1000 rupees it's a good purchase. It's distorts the sound if you shake a bit.
Brand is excellent  product faulty,2.0,"Thanks to Amazon ,I had waited for so many months to purchase this item,nice product.Most important  is product is faulty, audio sound of call is so low ,i can  not able  to  voice of other side, well  now I am  trying to  contact  with  customer care of boat,but office  is closed in Monday  also, it is my suggestion to Amazon  before  send the product to customer, are they confirmed that  product  is in good  condition ."
Worth the money,4.0,"This wireless earphones are worth their cost.Good sound quality for calls and music(treble and bass), good bluetooth range, no disruptions, light weight, there is a hint of noise cancellation as well, battery backup is good"
Left headphone stopped working,3.0,"after using it for five months, left side of the headphone stopped working.Sound quality is good, but the sound is not up to the mark. Noise Cancellation is bad, person on other side cannot hear our voice properly even if there was a small disturbance. and last but not the least, the service center for boat in Hyderabad is located in only one place and it is approximately 25kms from where im staying, it will take 2 hrs for me to go there in traffic and have to deal with them and may be after whole day i have to spent their to get it fixed. Basically what im trying to say here is, service is bad."
Trash mic and audio quality,2.0,"Straight garbage. Got these headphones a few days ago and at the start I thought they were fine. Today I was on a call with my friend and he asked ‚ÄúHey, what happened to your mic the quality is so bad‚Äù. I was playing a game and there was this one sound effect with a bunch of bass and loudness to it, but using the headphones it just became this light squeak that kind of shrilled. I do not recommend these headphones at all, I strongly recommend Sony‚Äôs WI-C200 at around 2K. Definitely not recommending these to anyone."
"Careless, Irresponsive, Untrustable Customer Care Team. Never responds ever via calls or mails.",1.0,"Sound Quality, Noise Cancellation and Bluetooth Connectivity is good enough in this budget. But the mic went bad within 5months of purchase. Even one side earphone stopped working. But the main problem is that their customer service is hardly ever reachable if you face an issue. They pick up the earphones for service by a courier and never responded again. It's been 2 weeks already since I sent them my bluetooth earphones but I am yet to get a reply, leave alone getting my earphones. As far as I know this is a similar case like another brand called 'House of Marley'. 'Boat' Brand is very bad in their customer service response. This is a major drawback for an upcoming brand since if customer service team is careless then buying a 'Boat' brand product is as risky as buying any other non branded product."
Very good earphone of this cost.,4.0,"Sound quality is good. Bass is wonderful. Better life is awesome. There is no connecting issues. Before order I am very much doubtful about the performance of this earfone, because of reading some reviews in Amazon. But when I used this, I am very much satisfied. Amazon shipping is always good and prompt."
The boat company has to give parament colour for the blutooth,2.0,"This review I give after the using this product 3/4 month, the price range is very nice and look also grate its have a premium look, sound quality, bass and convectivity is very good but the product colour is not permeant. Above I uploaded the pic please watch and make sour to buy because the colour is not permeant its destroy only 2/3 monthsThe boat has to upgrade the colour quality has parament because after colour destroy its not look Your company logo also destroyed so plz before buy sure about the colour"
Waste of money,1.0,After 6 months of use the left side was not working. Then got replacement of new earphone with warranty which lasted for only 2 months. Now OnePlus wireless z is available for 1999 please go for that. Sure OnePlus build quality is 100 times better than this earphone with better battery also.
Classy Product,5.0,I like the design of the headset. The best part of headset is sound the movement just turn it on i feel like i was in heaven and the beats were so good very can abel to listen each other and evry instrument which was played in the headset it was crystal Clear and i recommended this is one of the fantastic product and paisa vasool product.. please go for it...
Worst product,1.0,"The product gone bad after 14 days of usage. It is not getting turned on and when turned on, it hangs and battery drains completely in half an hour. I saw many bad reviews also but I went for the brand name Boat Rockerz but it's completely horrible.I suggest don't buy it or u will surely regret.Now I am worried I have to run here n there to claim warranty.Again guiding don't buy it."
Decent sound,3.0,"Heya,Sound is good bass is perfect treble is bit low and talking about comfort noise cancelation is perfect. Souind could have been better from  my end, add some money and go for realme wireless buds 2, Loudness is perfect but mic is not worth for calling."
Headphone was good they never give warranty on product,1.0,I have taken 255 pro after 5 months headphone was not working properly. I have download invoice from Amazon  then after I my completing on boat service they give me ticket number after 2 days they are saying invalid invoice. Then I have seen my emai that boat  service send me a another person bill and saying that my bill is invalid ... I am very disappointed from boat service .... I will never purchase from boat products .. I think they give fake warranty and fake products.üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†
Stopped after 3 months,2.0,It's been 3 months and they stopped working suddenly. I will raise request through the customer care to see if they give any refund or replace.I really don't think they are sweat proof so if you are considering them for workout just keep this in mind.
Worth it!,4.0,"I brought it as I needed something to use while riding a bike or exercising but was not sure if it will be able to handle sweat, water, etc.To my surprise, it's working nice even in sunlight and rains.The only star I deducted is because I find the wires are little stiff than what I expected...probably that's good enough to keep ear plugs intact but having a visible loop to self is a little annoying to me."
Bad connectivity.,2.0,"The product was well packaged in the usual amazon bubble wrap bag although the bottom of the actual packaging was squished. But after using it for two days, i noticed that it had a lot of connectivity issues. The minute i keep my phone in my pocket, the sound starts glitching. I can't hear the music or the voice on the other end pf the call. This is disappointing since I expected this particular brand to have extremely good connectivity, at least 10m. If my phone is in clear view, like on the table, the earphones work well. But the moment i keep it in my pocket & walk, the sound starts glitching.Pros:1. The earphones have a good look.2. They sit well around the neck.3. Get connected very fast to devices.4. I like the in built voice to indicate phone calls, powering on & off. Rather than the phone's ringtone blaring in our ears while connected to the phone, ""Incoming Call"" suffices.5. Pop music, rock music ounds really good.6. Very good noise cancellation.Cons:1. Bluetooth range is bad.2. Not good for instrumental, classical music.3. Bad microphone. No noise cancellation for phone calls.4. Ears start aching after a while."
EXCELLENT AFTER SALES SERVICE,5.0,"Purchased this on may 2019. Good sound quality and clarity.One of the speakers stopped working after usage for around 6 months.Filed a warranty claim against the one year guarantee out of the boxWhat amazed me was the prompt response and service i received from the customer care/support team at imagine marketing india pvt ltd. after arranging for a pickup on mY product,today on 25th february 2020,i received a replacement unit completely free of costWhoever is reading this comment, i highly recommend you to purchase this as the after sales service was way beyond satisfactory.WELL DONE IMAGINE MARKETING INDA PVT. LTD."
Not recommended,1.0,Not happy with the product at all.The battery dies within 2 hours. Don't even expect it to last for more than 15 minutes after it hits 40%.Sound quality is so bad. If you keep walking while having this headphone on there is continuous sound distortion.Wire is too long.Also there is no way to skip tracks by double tapping the button.The magnet is not functional and does not pause or play music.Oneplus z is a much better option. It also has the functionality to switch between devices.
Value for Money,4.0,These some of the most worthy BT Headphones in its price.Pros:1. Good Bass2. Flexible3. Easy to Connect and Control4. Decent Battery Life (6-8 hours)Cons:1. Loose Ear Grip2. A bit too Lightweight3. Flimsy4. Doesn't have any indciation for battery life
Amazing sound quality but have LATENCY issue,5.0,It has amazing sound quality bass is superb and punchy.Pros1. Earbuds seals the ears and cancels the outdoor noise it fits properly and stays in ear for longer time.2. The battery backup is good about 6-7 hr of playback and about more than full day standby.3. Amazing sound qualityCons1. Bluetooth connectivity is not so good you can feel the desortion in sound when phone is in another room. Also i have experienced signal drop in open areas when phone is in pocket.2. LATENCY IS BAD its not a good product to play games and watch movies and series you will have to adjust the audio delay everytime and still you will face half second latency.This is the only issue overall product is awesome
Not recommended at all! Wastage of money!,1.0,"It is one of the worst product in the wireless headset segment. It just survived 1yr.Battery backup: approx 4hrsWhen on Call: gets disconnected from the phone, additional annoying sound can be heard to the person on the other side."
Not worth it,5.0,"Decent for work or causal music listening. But not the best option for running or working out. Lasted only 6 months. Mic gives a lot of noise to the listener. After 6 months of use, it stopped connecting on its own. The automated voice of the speaker went from male baritone to a squeek."
Best headset with battery backup,5.0,"Positive points:Very good battery backup, single time charge comes for 3days.Sound quality is good.Negative :Magnet connect will not cut off Bluetooth function.. It will continue playing till manually switch off.We have to wear headphone to understand  the feedback for the headphone is switched off."
Adds too much noise while calls,2.0,"this neckband very handy and lightweight to use, but no value for money.very poor calling feature much time the other person on the call couldn't hear your voice, sometimes call doesn't switch to the neckbands microphone and most importantly it adds too much noise in the call so you will have to switch it off and use your phone's mic to continue on call.Battery life also not much 6-7 hrs.buy this if you want it only for listing music"
Amazon selling duplicate electronic product,1.0,Very bad quality product. I am not sur amzon sell original product. Policy no refund. Amazon customer care guys behavior very bad. I am very fadeup this time. I recommend buy any product from Amazon read policy and avoid to buy electronic product from Amazon..
I used them personally & would strongly recommend against any other earphone in same range.,5.0,"So, If ur looking for a balanced product around 1-1.5k price point these are the best u can get. Bass & Sound quality on this one is great. Bass is bit more but can obviously be adjusted using music players & Noise cancellation on this is great. Best part is battery. Battery of this product is like awesome & recharge time is also less so that is what makes it special & fits in ears perfectly. And also cable quality seems good. So, Yes it's an even deal go for it & enjoy ur Boat rockerzzz."
Worked fine for only 6 months.,1.0,I am writing this review after 10months of use.It's not reliable. it's one earplug is not working now. And also I am facing connectivity issues.Please don't buy this product. I have purchased 4 neckband for me and my cousin. But All them got faulty after 6 months. I will not recommend this anymore
Experience after 1 year of usage,3.0,I have been using this product for an year now. Let me share my experience:Pros:1. Battery backup was good for 3 months2. Comfortable3. Bluetooth connectivity is goodCons:1. Right side speaker stopped working after 1 year.2. Noise cancellation is very poor3. Battery life after 3 months is around 4 hrs. 2 hrs with continuous usage.4. Bass and sound quality is average.
Bought once replaced once and stopped working,1.0,"Bought this as it was recommended due to its value for money. After 3 months of use, one side stopped functioning. Got a replacement as it was under warranty. Now the replacement also has stopped working after 3-4 months of use. It is not charging hence I'm unable to use it. I'd recommend going for another Bluetooth earphones."
Head phone is ok but company is worst,1.0,"My experience with boat headphones are very bad it is in warranty for 1 year, one month left for warrant  right side speaker stopped working as company policy they changed my product with new product, that's good, but product i received from them after 1 month facing same problem with new one, i called boat customer care about this they said sorry sir your product is out of warranty, we cannot do anything you have to charges for repair, that means they are making fool of customer, they said they gives to new one as replacement but they will gives you faulty product,"
Except for the specifications.,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Love the product for now. Considering that you know everything about the specifications , I won't bore you further. The packaging was good. It was bubble wrapped properly. The product quantity is really good. Love the feel. Colour is amazing as well. It will come 100 percent charged. Also , the charge will last for a good 38 hours.  Talking about the sound quality, A class!  (:"
Bad Performance - boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+,1.0,"I bought this boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ two weeks ago. Unfortunately I am very disappointed with the quality. They say about Bass, there is literally no Bass. When I play music, this is horrible.If you are just looking for calls, this may work so-so but do not expect to listen music, specially with bass.Unfortunately I can't return it now coz 10 days are over. I wish I could have return this boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ back."
Excellent Quality,5.0,"Excellent Product! It comes with 1 charging wire, 2 pairs of extra buds, 1 sticker, gurantee/ Warantee card. The pointers above are smooth and protects the earphones from falling but if you have any problem with them you can remove them. Just remove the buds and take it out and then again put it on. The mic works really good and no problem from in listening continuously for 6hrs and after 6hrs the battery remains around 70-80%. Charging is also really fast. It totally worth it."
Tight ear buds.,4.0,I enjoy having ear buds that fit tightly and don't need adjustment when I exercise.  Sound is great and when I try and turn of the volume it pauses to warn me that the volume is too loud.  This is important because I already have ruined my hearing with another pair of earphones.  After years of working out wearing earbuds I made the mistake of purchasing systems that allowed me to go loud.  In the moment it seemed like a good idea but at the age of 53  my ears have a permeant high pitch ringing.  It sucks.  Very happy with this product.
Doesn't even produce sound man!!!,1.0,"I got a product which was not working.. then i replaced it , hoping it would be sorted and boommm.. this time it didn't even work üòÇ.. this is an honest review with no intention of hurting company's ratings.. but seriously getting this from a company like boAt is not at all expected. Hope it helps!!"
Highly recommended,5.0,"Now, im writing This as a musician.So you could expect This review to be credible.First of all, im in love with these earphones. These are one of the best if not the best budget bluetooth earphones in the market.Sure there are a few flaws, but if you're not a musician/producer (anyone related to the music profession.) You'll not understand. Hell, even a few beginners wouldn't understand.If you're looking for great sound, a great experience and a great customer service, boat is what you should go with.However, if you're looking for perfect sound quality for something like music production or mixing, you're not going to get that in this range."
Best earphone with a lifespan of 3 months.,1.0,"Purchased it couple of months back. I learnt my lesson that if you are looking for a reasonable wireless earphone you gotta empty your pocket a bit. These mid range wireless earphones within 1000-2000 rs range is just waste of money. Because after 3 months these become useless. I bought sony mdr xb50s that cost me close to 5k that time, but i lost it. Decided to go for mid range pieces . None of them lasted for more than 3 months including this one . Bought sony mdr xb50s again ."
Best headphones no word,5.0,My best purchase ...very honest review plzzz read all...1..First best part of boat rockerz 255 it's sound quality and build quality ...No compare with other Bluetooth headphones like bould curve probass neckband like noise and etc...2..boat a papular brand and most trusteble brand in India is also made in India product...by most papular company Harman ...3..the bass is totally fabulous.... I believe you like very much ..4 ..I request to all plzzz don't west your money and time for bould noise and other headphones purches ..Go for it........
Call quality issue,3.0,Everything was good like sound quality noise cancellation and battery life.. but call quality  is not good I dono while taking I can hear only some robotic noise from the other end.. help me to fix this or I will return
Great headphone with a major drawback.,3.0,"I'm purchased this headphone in January of 2019 and using it daily since.# Battery last about 6 hours of mixed use( gaming+ call+video)# Sound quality is good and call clearity is nice.# This headphone has a major issue that is left or right side of earpice stops working after about 3 month of use. I have replaced it 4 time in a year, with a waiting time 1 month to get replaced by boat. This problem is not limited to me only my 2 friends have the same problem. Because of this I donot recommend this headphone to anyone."
Good earphone,5.0,The earphone is pretty good. The grip is excellent. It does not move when you workout. It provides decent sound insulation. The sound quality is pretty good. The battery backup is good. I could play music constantly for around 8 hours before it discharged from full charge. It takes around 1.5 to 2 hours to charge it from 0% to 100%
Nice product,4.0,"Battara is good üòö i used it 3-4 days (7,8 hrs every day) , sound quality is also clear and good but if u need only for listing songs then bass is not that much good (10 mm ), mic quality is also very good I didn't get any problems while calling , latency is low  (not that much good for gaming), Some suggestions -1. Never charge with a high voltage or fast charger.  Charge with a low approx. 15 V charger. 2. Don't ever put in water it's really not water proof  üòÖConclusion is that best for songs listing and battery backup. It's value for money product."
"Connectivity, Mic & Customer Service Issues",3.0,"Purchased this product just a 3 months back trusting the quality of 'boAt', however, I have been repeatedly facing issues with its Connectivity & Mic.1. The device takes time to get paired, gets disconnected anytime, sometimes gets connected only for media and not for calls.2. Mic of the product is very poor. People on the other side of the call, often complains that they can't hear my voice and as soon as i switch to the phone's mic then everything gets normal.3. Trying to reach out to the team to get it exchanged as it's under warranty but getting no response.Utterly Disappointed!!!"
One of the best,4.0,"Well, first things first... Amazing at this cost... I have used Sennheiser, Sony, JBL... But when compared to these premium brands, Boat Rockerz 25S headset has beaten them all!!!! Why??1. Noise Cancellation: One of the best noise cancellation headset, I've ever used... I would say, 8/10 on this parameter.. Outside noise is very much muted, but as I would have wanted, a bit outside noise is very much needed.. Safety first...2. Sound Quality: bass is just awesome.. Just good enough that one would have wanted. Treble is also good. Sound is clear and that's what matters most.Blootooth connectivity: It is above average, connect quite quickly.."
Very disappointed üòî,2.0,"Have heard a lot of good things about these earphones, but to my disappointment I'm not happy with the purchase. I bought it two months back, and now one of the earpiece is not working. Only one side is playing the music and that too at low volume. Very disappointed. üôÑ"
Awesome sound quality.,5.0,Awesome sound quality this product is really fantastic if you want to buy bluetooth headset under  2000 rupees this is the best option I would suggest really enjoy listening music through this Bluetooth headset and voice quality is awesome during calling good battery backup and prices also usually.Thank you so much boat and thank you so much for reading my review.
A fine product with genuine features.,4.0,"*Writing the review after 1 week of use.Product is good, the brand #Boat you can trust it. Sound is amazing and #Bass for which i was excited is good enough. May be for some of you bass can be a problem but guys for a price of this plus wireless you can't expect more. Also this product is long lasting.  Things i liked about this-1. design2. Bass3. Magnet4. It's  durability"
Super as of now,4.0,It's one day use... will write later--After 5 days use i have found one issue. that battery is getting drain within 1 hour from 60% to 0% and get switch off.Pro:Good sound qualitygood battery until 60%Good quality for this priceQuick connection2 device connectionnoise cancelCon:Battery after 60%For battery issue i made replacement.so i got new one today 11/22/2019. : )Will check and update the status.Hi Got replacement.after 1 month use am updating belowsound/battery/bass/clarity all so goodrealy worth for money. dont wait grab it.
It used to 12hours it's so good and comfortable,5.0,"I use headsets about 12 hours a day, so I require that they are comfortable to wear.These are comfy and nice, I like the design. The back part is flexible and rubbery and you can hardly tell it's there when wearing them.Everything (except charger) is in one convenient location: around your neck. No need to stuff it a case, your pockets, bag, or backpack when traveling from place to place"
Above avg sound quality and Value for money product,4.0,"After exactly 6 days of extensive use of calling and music.Below is a short review,hope it will help.Pros:Pocket friendly bluetooth earphnNoise cancellation goodNo prblm in calling voice qualityBass is goodQuality of wire is goodCons:Music quality is above avg,not overwhelming if u r an avid music listener.Rest everything is gd if u look at the price bucket,I bought it @1100,and it's working fine till now(touchwood).I will say its value for money deal."
mic not working,1.0,It has magnetic earbuds but it does notsupport turning off when earbuds are joined.mic not working.Quality and looks is average.Lot of voice feedback thats annoying sometimes.Got connected to mobile and Laptop very easliy.
Not Very Comfortable to wear,4.0,Okay the product is over-all great for the price range i.e 1499 Pros 1. great overall sound quality  2.Battery Capacity is overall great since it lasted days of medium use on 100% Charge3. Connectivity is great tooCons  From my personal experience of using it for 2days I have noticed that it is not very comfortable to wear the earbuds as I felt a slight pain and I don't know why it won't go into my ear completely but again it is what I experienced personal preference maybe you will find it comfortableOverall a great product and I would definitely suggest it for the given price range
Average headset with irritating ringing tone,2.0,"I did not have any special expectations for the headset and it was simply that. An average headset for an affordable price. There is nothing special to write home about.Cons:1. The irritating ringing tone that blasts your ear when someone calls. I feel like pulling it off my ear and just chucking it somewhere.2. The battery level indicator is not linear. It stays at 80% most of the time and when you are in the middle of a call, it says battery low and goes off within 5 minutes.3. After six months, the right ear bud stopped working. I guess the replacement warranty was for six months.All in all, I would not recommend this."
Waster of Money.,1.0,I ordered it 3 months before. It was working fine but suddenly it stopped working. Some time it was very noisy and some times very low sound. I contacted the support and asked for service and they picked up the product for service. But when they returned it where was no ear bud and the ear holder in it which is important to hold in ear and noise cancelling and i cannot by it anywhere separately. Now the money i spent is waste. The earphone is hanging in a wall at home. Worst quality and worst service.
Pretty bad to be honest. Can't understand the high ratings,3.0,Gotta say. The sound quality is garbage. I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking but the sound quality is reaaaly bad. It's muffled and booms and clarity is atrocious. Imagine hearing a waterfall with artificially boosted bass. I have a pair of 700 bucks sennheisers and they're MILES better. I only use these earphones for calls now.
Long battery avg sound quality,3.0,"I have been using this from a week ,ratings are as below1)good battery backup upto 37 h 5/52)average sound quality , not that great 2/53)price is very cheap only 900 in sales 4/54)sound very loud but not good quality 3/55) very uncomfortable to wear , especially right side one due to weight of mic. it used to fall from ears. 1/56)no lag while listening song and video , but lags little while playing PUBG 2/5Overall not bad at this price range. Good for students , not for music professionals."
Value for money,5.0,"I am using this headset for more than 1 year. Purchased for ‚Çπ1500. Sound quality, Base everything is good for this price.Charging time: 2 - 3 hours normal charging (Not tried turbo / Fast charging).Working time: 6 - 7 hours, of music & phone calls.For music: smooth and clear sound quality. Volume increase and decrease buttons available.For phone calls: Good, i didn't found anything bad.Wearing: I am using it for running, Gym, driving (Able to wear inside helmet).Connectivity: Bluetooth, automatically switch off when device not connected (within 5min)"
Good at this price range!!,4.0,"I brought this headphone compared to nothing. So previously i didn't have any Bluetooth headset. What i find good about this product is that 1. Its very light weight, very easy to carry while wearing 2. The quality of the chord is great, it can't damage easily 3. The sound  quality is awesome and the best part is the noise cancellation which works completely great. Its takes only few minutes to get charged while plays for hours which is very great.Now after using this for about one month the problem i have found is with the Bluetooth connection, sometime might face problem with lagging while listening.But this problem you will feel rarely like in a day 4-5 times.Apart from that, this is a great product to buy."
Must have..... Good one to buy,4.0,"Good product with decent battery life..... I bought it during Great Amazon sale for RS.999/- and it's worth for the money.... One of my friend bought Realme earbuds for RS. 1599/- during the same sale but when compared to Realme Earbuds, boat Rockerz 255 is way better in terms of sound output üòç. I am very much Happy with this product üòä"
Worst item ever.,1.0,"Worst item. I Purchased this headset on 29th nov 2020. For 2 months it good to use. After that i faced the issue. When i tried to see a movie the sound will disconnected every 10 seconds. I cannot get a clear voice .  I was very disappointed about this product in Boat.I tried to register a complaint regarding this, but the website is also not supporting. If i want to replace or repair this item i have to travel 20kms for service center. Its shows lyk that in the complaint page. Wat a nonsense ."
"If battery is not the concern, u can go for it at 999",2.0,Though sound quality is good (according to it's price). I would suggest u to simply switch off the dolby music in ur phone settings to enjoy the original boat.My concern is about it's battery life... it's not been a month and it started creating problem. Showing 50 to 60% battery and fall to 10 instantly.hardly gives 3 hrs irrespective of what volume u r using it. I bought it for 999 and I found it not worth for it's price.
Better grip expected with hooks over the ear,3.0,Product received is as per the description given at time of order placement. Bass is good if used in both ears simultaneously. Voice clarity is good. Good battery life.Only thing I wished was a better grip . The rubber hooks hardly helps to keep it fixed in my ears and the buds seem to come off frequently even though they are at an angle.i wished if manufacture could have provided over-the-ears hooks as an option
Terrible sound quality.,2.0,"Terrible sound quality. I don't have much idea about songs from the EDM, pop genre but if you are one who's into rock/metal or the likes then stay as far away from this as possible. The sound clarity is terribly. Lows can be lived with, the mids would make you hate your decision to buy, the highs would make you kill yourself. Noise cancellation is satisfactory but nothing beyond that. Charging never seemed a hassle to me and lasts a decent amount of time on battery. Build quality is good however it's only been a week. In terms of comfort, never really had any issues despite running it for a continuous 2-3 hours once. Buds are soft and fit in snugly. Bluetooth connectivity is strong, however there are times when the connection stutters.And yes, it cannot be refunded,only replaced. So purchase wisely."
Bass is on heavy side,5.0,Bass is on heavy side battery back up is good I get close to 7 hours with half volume the grip on the earphones are really getting good overall I see there should be a bit more balance of treble and bass on the headphones I Brought these on sale for 999 which is awesome price go for it
Service life 1.5 years,3.0,Well I used it for 1 years 8 months. I bought this in April 2019. The first time one ear stopped working was in October 2019. Since it was within warranty period I had it replaced with a new one. Then again it stopped working 2 days ago and now I cannot get it replaced. Overall it served good and am satisfied with its quality. But it's not sweat resistant actually so wouldn't recommend for a heavy workout session.
Best in the budget,5.0,"I am really glad of having this product. The previous one from boat was boat rockerz 400 whose sound quality with bass was just fabulous but call quality dissapointed me but this one really is excellent... I think i made the right choice of having this great product. Really awsome product with best call quality , best durability, an excellent sound quality and a decent battery backup. What else one need from a product ranging around 1-1.5 k.. Really i just loved it"
NOT CHARGING. REPLACE IMMEDIATELY,1.0,It was good while it lasted till today. But suddenly stopped charging. I cannot chare it and the red ligh is not on when I plug it to the charger. Please replace it as it charger is not working. I'm extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with the charger.It's only aone mont since i purchased. Please replace immediately.REPLACE IMMEDIATELY. REPLY IMMEDIATELY.
Will definitely break and they'll provide no support,1.0,"I had my boat rockerz 255 picked up on 11th September for replacement as one side was not working properly Since then I have got no revert from the boat's team, these guys are not picking up there calls on customer care number and are giving no response over the email from 20-25 days. My Ticket id is 538530.It's been a pathetic experience with the boat as these guys clearly don't value there customers and are running there business like ""Gupta Jee's"" Shop. They are only hungry for your money and as you can see they don't provide any real support on their social media pages as well."
Very good product,5.0,"I am writing this review after one and half months the battery life is good . Value for money but it was costly i got in sale gor 900 wait for sales of diwali . If u buy this product i suggest if u want for calling and listing songs its good its noise cancellation is also good, if you want to buy onlyfor music listening go for head phone it will give nice experience ."
Don't buy it!!!,1.0,The worst product I have ever bought.I bought it thinking it won't give me a chance of complaining but it's one side stopped working after some days and other side also started dysfunctioning. I couldn't return it back here because this earphones stopped working after it's return date mentioned on Amazon. And now I am trying to claim warranty but it's also very frustrating as they aren't providing me any meaningful help for it.I suggest not to buy this product as neither the product is good nor the boat gives good customer service
Absolute value for money,4.0,"Bought during the festival sales for 800, 5 Star for pricing and 1 day delivery.Pros:1. Above average sound quality2. Bluetooth connectivity is trouble free.3. Ergonomics are good4. Superior build qualityCons:1. Bluetooth range is low2. Noise heard for other person on call3. Sound distortion at high volumeMy verdict it's an absolute buy if you get it under 1000 Rs deals."
Good one at this price level,4.0,"Good one at this price level. üîãIs really good,if u have minimal need u don't have to charge more than once in a week.If boat works on below point it is really unbeatable in the market.1. Noise cancellation is not up to the mark.2.call receive and end function some time work some time won't.3.I am facing it when I was in Whatapp call and if I received normal call than after normal call end up it got disconnected and than manually need to reconnect."
Best in the price.,5.0,"Good build quality, sound is good, Bass is moderate and doesn't suppress the treble, noise cancellation is average, suppress little background noise(better have cvc noise cancellation than nothing). Call quality is very good, gaming latency is high. Not recommended for gamers. Rest It serves my purpose."

This product boat rockerz 255 pro+,4.0,"This product we but under 900, this is best product under 1500 . We are use from 15 days or more , this product battery life is extreme normally use 2.5 hours gaming üéÆ, 2 to 3 hours movie or video after 4 days use battery percentage is 40. Sound quality is very good and noise cancellation is best, bass quality like ok ok is good not very good. Trust me this product is value for money üíµ and 1 more thing this product is having IPX7 mean this product is water üí¶ Proof , but me can't try under water."
Boat rockers review 3 months,3.0,Pros:+Decent sound quality+Durable+Easy to fit in ear+Noise cancellationCons;-Extremely poor battry life (lasts less than 2 hrs)-Not recommended for people who love to hear original sound effects in music. (I like bass so it was okay for me)3 star due to poor battery life. Had to recharge very frequently.
Totally wasted,1.0,"I received the product on 25th Dec and then onwards it worked properly for 2-3days, then it started creating issue, it always get disconnected and connected everytime, it's return option is also get closed on 1st.I am so helpless"
Excellent base,4.0,"First things first, If not every one few people are curious at what price did others buy it, like am I paying too much ???? or Am I getting it at low price and book it out!!!! and stuff.So I got this product at 1,399.00.This is how I personally felt, so if there is anything wrong ignore it.Now coming to  pros and cons.Pros1 ) Base is extremely good, you don't feel like its screaming into your ear at high volume.2) Noise cancellation is pretty good.3) Taking calls and stuff is good.Cons.1) Bluetooth is a bit slow, it takes 2 sec to reflect say to pause the Song or go to next one.2) It makes that beep sound every time hit vol +/- . Personally I hate that.Thank you for reading."
Product Support,2.0,"One side of the Boat 255 stopped working and I have been trying to reach the customer support with no success to claim warranty. I called the nearest warranty center of HSR with no success. I have sent them an email a few days back also and no response. Their online complaint registration form doesn't give the option to enter the pin code and other below details and later when I attach the Invoice and try to send, it says enter details. The warranty is expiring on 28th SeptAmazon should help to claim a warranty!"
Very Poor battery life,2.0,"Extremely poor battery life in this price range. Sound quality is very very average. Don‚Äôt buy, you will regret. Connectivity is also very bad disconnects randomly.Worst product form Boat. üëéüèæüëéüèæüëéüèæI replaced it once thinking issue is with one particular piece but I was wrong."
Recieved a defective product,2.0,"I have ordered two boat rockers, one black for my mom and one red for myself, so the black one was truly awesome, but this red one was different, the sound quality was different, it was low, the earnobes fitting was loose, and then when i tried replacing it, it said i have to courier it myself, there is no pickup, so i m not satisfied with this red one, the other black one i bought is truly amazing. I wish the red one was also like that"
Does not last for more than 3 months,1.0,"This is bad product in the sense that it works for a couple of months and then one headphone stops working and after a few days the other one too stops working. The worst thing is that the company sells this product under replacement warranty of one year, meaning that they will replace the product within one ear, but when you call their helpline no one picks up the phone, the website does not work. Seems like a fraud company with fly by night ethics. I had bought two headsets-- one for myself and one for my brother. Both of them stopped working within 3 months."
Not upto the mark...Treble low..Bass High...Poor Connectivity,3.0,"First impressions were good but after using for about 1 hour..real problems came to my knowledge...Bass is no doubt of decent quality but treble is low...i felt some point that the voice isn't clear..and i am not that fan of bass that i would compromise with the Voice quality (Treble)... Secondly the connectivity is very bad...it claims to be having a range of 10 meters but in my case lost it within 10 meters...and also the Bluetooth isn't provided with the latest 5.0..its still version 4.1..perhaps if it would have came up with the latest Bluetooth version ,the connectivity could have been better..as now all phones supports Bluetooth 5.0..i would suggest in this price range...Nu Republic JAXX 3 is a very good Earphone with great sound quality then this.."
Not bad,3.0,It's good for listening music and calls. But when I disconnect calls or receive calls.. the sound of disconnecting calls  & ringtone is too much that hurts your ears. Battery doesn't last longer. Lasts only for 3 hrs approx. on calls. Can be bought if the price is less than 1000.
Average product,3.0,Better sound quality with almost noise cancellation.I brought this product mainly coz i want to attend all type of call without keeping mobile on call. But there was a problem with this product that if it is connected then also when anyone calls through whatsapp the we can't hear the voice through earpiece if the Bluetooth mode is enabled on. For attending whatsapp call we have to talk directly through mobile no use for this earphone at all.That's the main reason for not recommending this product
Good for price range,4.0,"Sound quality is good. Deep bass. Battery charging takes about 1.5 hrs... Battery drains very slowly till 60% and after that it'll drain at double rate and it becomes difficult to use headphones after 20% battery. It keeps giving battery low warning every minute or two which is kinda annoying. Overall battery life for continuous use is 6-7 hrs, with standby it can go upto 12 hrs.Bluetooth connectivity is good but music stops momentarily sometimes. Other than that it's a really good product."
Well it says pro but it isn't,3.0,"Honestly this is good if you prefer professional communication for work, it would help as the battery will last a week.But for music, gaming and handsfree use its averageIf you're riding a bike or in the market the caller would hear everything but you, so poor noise cancellation"
Must buy wireless earphone.,4.0,"I have already used boat earphone and was quite satisfied with the performance interms of sound and bass, however I didn't expect that much this boat rockers 255 is tremendously performing great sound, clearance, noice cancellation bass will never gonna feel you headache and all if I talk about battery it works 7 Hours a day continuesly...well fitted in ear without any pain got this deal at lightning price at 999.Thanks Amazon to provide such deal and swift delivery and your faith!!!"
Amazing sound quality,5.0,"Must go for this. Lower priced perfect bluetooth earphone. I used it for around 1 year and battery life was stands constantly 4-5 hours and charging was 40-60 mins. No issue with battery and not with sound quality.A single drawback user feel is its wire length, but it's not that big issue. Just go for it"
AVERAGE PRODUCT.,3.0,"I have purchased OnePlus first, that had some issues, then bought Boat Rockerz.Starting from the package, I wasn't happy it had issues with sound quality, voice recording and all. The build quality too isn't upto the mark.I tried to return this item, but amazon said they can only replace. I have replaced it. The new one is slightly better. But not what I want to use. So returning the same."
Overall aaudio quality during  the call,3.0,"Pro:Good for listening to musicCons:First thing this product though claimed Indian, is made in China.Second during audio or video call the person on the other side is not able to hear properly either low volume or breaking voiceThirdly Battery life is not that greatNext is when the battery is at 20%, it just keep shouting battery is low and very annoying during the callNext From 20 % charge with in 20 min the headphone switched off during the call"
Good product at this price,4.0,What more do you expect at 899. Even 4000 rs Bluetooth headsets are failing. None of the products have completely positive reviews therefore I decided to go with cheap and best and this one really does the job. Battery backup is not very long but ok. 20 feet of range approx
"BAD AFTER SALE SERVICE, HIGHLY  RECOMMENDED DON'T BUY & GO FOR OTHER BRAND WITH SIMILAR PRODUCTS",1.0,"I highly recommend don't buy Boat products, If you are looking for expensive product without any warranty claims requirements than go for it, dont keep any expectation for after sale service, they will niether answer your call or if you visit service center there also you will not get any positive response (Service centre executives are also frustrated because of companies bad after sale service, they are also helpless) as the problem is in roots of this companies management, you can try calling National Customer care number of boat they will not pick up your call - 02249461882, either go for some other brand."
Worst Sound Quality like 50wala earphone,2.0,Sound Quality 50 wale earphone ki hi jaisi hai uske alava battery hi sahi haiMic wala part left me dena chahiye tha right me de diya isse acha Boult ka probass flow x hai bohot acha tha uske badle le liya tha boat ka naam suna tha magar expect nahi kiya tha ki itna ganda rahega 3rd Replacement dala hu ki koi to acha mile sab duplicate hi lag raha hai og ki feel nahi aa rahi haiLagta hai Refurbish ya first copy hai boat ka og maal nahi de raha hai ye seller
Read the whole...do not use for gaming lag of 1 sec is found,4.0,Using it for 3 weeksBass is good but could be betterNoise cancellation not upto the mark bit yes on 90 percent volume monst of noise is cancelledSound quality is excellentBattery is good because in one charge i use it for 5 hours or maybe a bit less at 80-90 percent volume which is niceGets connected very fastDo not use for gaming as the sound of footsteps and bullets will come after 1 second(happened with me I have realme 6 with bt v5.0) and no one prefers any wireless headphones for gaming until they are above 2500Go for wired if you want to play games
Much recommended,5.0,"I am more of a calling person rather than music one. I carry two phones which keeps on ringing alternatively throughout the day (don't worry i dont work in a call centre üòù). The biggest reason why i opted for a Bluetooth earphone was to protect my phone's from the sweat as i live in a humid area and also to avoid direct exposure to radiations to a certain extent. I did a lot of research but nothing couldn't convince me so i thought of purchasing Bluetooth headset of reconnect (reliance electronics brand) which costed me Rs 1000/-. It is a decent product to start with but will always be in back of your mind as you have to keep adjusting it time and again. Also the battery would last only 4 to 5 hours with my time of calling. Also the other person on call used to complain very often about the poor voice quality. Then i switched to boat rockers and trust me it's all together a different experience with almost similar price. The neck band will ensure its stability and it lasts almost the whole day even after 100 calls a day. And after almost a month of usage, nobody has raised concern about poor audio quality."
"Waste of money, poor quality",1.0,"It was a gift for my dad, didn‚Äôt work the way I wanted it to. Poor quality and the life of the earphones isnt good at all. I ordered one and it went bad in 2 days, exchanged it and other one went bad in 2 weeks! Extremely upset about it. Its still in warranty but feels like its just waste of time and money."
Satisfied at this price,5.0,"This is my first bluetooth neckband üòäüòäüòäAnd this product fully satisfied me.The actual price is 1599 but in GREAT INDIAN FESTIVAL I got it at 999.My overall ratings out of 5Sound quality at high volume-4.5Bass-4Battery backup-4Fast charging-5Look and design-5Bass is punchy not extraaI think you should wait for GREAT INDIAN FESTIVAL to bought it at 999 because at 1599 this neckband is not value for money and clearly it doesn't satisfies you.This is my opinionIf you like this review ü§†ü§†,dropüëç"
Okay but not great !,3.0,"Sound quality okbass quality okNoise cancellation goodNot very handy to carry easily slips from shoulder, high chance of getting misplaced while carryingNot sturdyDoes not justify BoAt quality ; a Little disappointed"
Headphones is very good but service of boat is very very and very worst.,3.0,"Sound quality is good bass also very good and noice cancellation is very very good. But the problem is service of boat is very very and very bad. I had never seen before as much worst service. Totally Disgusting. I do complain of my boat rockerz 16 days before but till now I don't have any thing. No headphones, no information, no any msg ,no call , nothing. Totally a bad service. If I talk about costumer care service then it's like a cowduck or potty. If you want to talk costumer care then they will never pickup your call or otherwise they say..iss rout ki sabhi line vayast h. That is the service of boat. And this is happening 3rd time with me."
255 Pro+,5.0,"Not a paid review. If your going for 255 series go for the pro + variant. Battery is mind-blowing, 1 charge can work for a week mostly on general usage. Range is awesome, no issues at all even if you switch rooms at times, just don't be over adventurous. Quick charge is awesome and works perfect. Once you buy make sure you adjust the buds as per your ears or you want get the clean sound output. Loudness is just right and sound quality is decent"
Read so you can describe the product on yr own way.,3.0,"Pros :1)Product quality good,sound good .2)light weight3)battery time /playback time over all good4)connectivity averageCons:1)After 30 min yr ears feeling presure2)Good connectivy when phone is in range3)some times i feel the lil slage in connectivity while silenting music.4) Its Not a product for daily bike commuters due to low noice cancellation.Overall good product on bases of prices..."
charging cable not fitting into earphone charging port  .....  gud at this price ...,5.0,The charging cable is not fitting into the charging port of the earphones not sure was it one off case or problem with everyones cable.....bass is not that great as of now ... not sure if that improves after some hours of burning ....i was using sennheiser cx street 2 so bass is not upto the mark is what i felt ...the vocals are a great treat though .....Bass - 3/5vocals - 4/5connectivity - 4/5vfm - 4/5
It's a good headphone,5.0,I had bought it for online classes. But I couldn't connect it to my 10 year old laptop. It is not supported on older bluetooth I think. But the headphone itself is a very good one at this price point. It fulfils all features that are advertised. Nothing to dislike.
Good Quality and Price-UPDATE,5.0,I really like this set. It's better than the one I got from the US. The drivers in this one are very good. I recommend this set.UPDATE: after using it for 9 months.1 side of the earphone has become very low. The one I got from the US is still working very well. I use the 1 from the US more than this one. I will not buy this brand again.
Best seamless service ‚ù§Ô∏è,4.0,"I have ordered 2 of these and both of them have stopped functioning within a week. But the best thing about BOAT is its warranty service they provide. After i registered for warranty claim i received my replaced product within a week. I don't know its good or bad but all the 6-7 products i used all have issues after sometime,but this is the awesome seamless service they provide that i become a fan of BOAT‚ù§Ô∏è. Proud to be a member of ‚ú®BOAT ‚ú®family.  #plug into nirvana"
Worst service i ever get,3.0,only after using for a month the the product stop working. I opted for warranty option. Even after 20 days when i returned the product to Boat team...did not get info when can i got my earphones back. First they said due to covid its is getting delayed then they said due to technical glitches we could not update when it will be repaired. pathetic experience.
Great Sound and Modest Price,4.0,"I got this for Rs. 999 and have been using it for about two weeks. So far I have used it to listen to music on Moto G4 Plus and some other phones, and I've used it to watch movies on my laptop. While the Bluetooth connection to my phone was seamless, it was a little difficult to connect to the laptop.Sound Quality: 4/5Bass Quality: 4/5Noise Cancellation: 4/5Design: 4/5Packaging: 5/5Pros:1. Easy to use.2. Great sound quality.Cons:1. Wires are a little long.2. Simultaneous Bluetooth connection to 2 devices did not work for me."
Pathetic connectivity,5.0,I am not sure whether its original boat Bluetooth... its been only 2 months but I am fleeting connectivity issues or charging issue... not able to understand.. I want to replace it with new one as I am fed of this Bluetooth...
Decent sound quality but product feels cheap,1.0,Sound quality is just about ok. Not something to rave about.I had issues with pairing or sometimes reconnection.Also the fit of the buds were not very comfortable in the ear - it hurts a lot
Disappointed,1.0,"Not satisfied by its fit in ear, its really uncomfortable, I have put small earbuds into it.. bt still it doesn't worked. My ears start hurting only in half an hour.. its sound quality is good..bt fit is completely uncomfortable.I need to change this model.. it is in return period. Bt Amazon is only availing its replacement with same product.Disappointed"
What else can do the job better!,5.0,"After using the product for more than two months, I am posting the review: this is the best budget Bluetooth Wireless Earphone for all my needs: be it the official calls when connected to laptop or smartphone, or for watching movies, this one does the job. Highly recommended from my end.With Love,Sarav"
Overall good product but poor quality control,4.0,"I ordered a blue boat rockerz 255 Pro+.Build, sound quality, bass, BT connectivity, battery backup and noise cancellation are all upto the mark.The issue is the quality control. Boat needs to work on that a lot. The first one I got started having outgoing volume issue within return period and the replaced one kept on connecting and disconnecting when not in use. Finally, got my 2nd replacement that is working fine as of now."
Very upset üò°,2.0,Its been a month i bought the product... all was going good now i am facing trouble with sound quality. People over the call don't get my voice no matter how loud i am speaking but the surrounding noise is too much... i can't even listen to my own voice note. Also the sound quality i hv experienced before 1 month  is getting too poor day by day... I am regretting now!! I heard of boat so much my expectations are all low now.. Please do help!!
Poor After Sales service by Boat Nirvana - Useless Warranty,1.0,"Please do not buy Boat products as the company has an extremely poor after sales service. My headset stopped working after 6 months and I have been sending mails and tweets to the company regularly from past 2 months however, there is no response from them yet. Later on, they will say that the warranty has expired and we will not be able to help. Better buy some other bramd headset."
Not durable,2.0,Stopped working within 4 months.. since then got replacement twice and none of them lasted for more than 2 days.My observation is that it is not sweat resistant as everytime I wore it for workouts it starts showing issues.
Issue with cable.,4.0,Before using comneted to power supply for full charging bt the cable attached with product that was value less not inserted properly and even not able to charge any device .After using 4-5 days  the backup was not so.good as per description & it shuts down when it was 20% of battery .so it's return period was over now I I don't know what to do with the issue .just make sure before delivery to customer all parts are working including the box.
Overall a good deal üëå,4.0,"Loved the colour (neon green). Sound quality is good. Felt heavier than the others I've used but that's understandable because of the bigger battery. Build quality is good, felt sturdy not flimsy. Got it for 899 in the sale. Will add my experience after I use it for more time. ‚úåÔ∏èOne thing I didn't like was the outer packing by Amazon which could've been better. üòë"
Not for calls only Music,3.0,After purchasing i regretted. Bcoz when i was taking calls outdoors the other party could not hear my voice properly as the mic is grabbing more outside noise than my voice. This is one heads-up to the users. If u are the person who takes calls during traffic or outdoors opposite person will literally get irritated.
Good for normal sounds lover,4.0,Its good for those who listen to music in a bit low volume...as its volume is low as compared to other ... I don't hve issue with tht. I don't listen too loud ... Bass is ok ... battery is quite good .. material is good hope it last longer... Sound quality is good
Not clear sound because of heavy bass,3.0,It is good earphone but not acceptable at this price i bought it for 1400 but now it is available in 999 so you can buy it in cheaper price. Sound is not as good as expected it has so heavy bass that the soung clearity is not there but if you san spend some more money then i must prefer for realme earphone. It is far better than this in sound and battery both.
Never buy again this product and never suggest to anyone,1.0,While I'm connected bluetooth so after 0.30minutes to 0.45minutes automatically disconnect and sometimes sound is very slow music / watching time and calling time opposite person always ask your voice is very slow please speak louder.
Falsole mrp mentioned. Original mrp isn't more than 3000.,4.0,No doubt the bass is good and charges quickly. I have been using it for past 4 months now. But the mrp mentioned on the website is WRONG. At the time I purchased it the mrp was 2500. Now it is showing almost 4000. So beware the original mrp is 2500. And yes it's a good deal but state original mrp.
Good product but not suitable for ladies,4.0,"I checked the reviews and bought it,it is good, but I missed the point, it doesn't suitable for ladies, it's too big for our ears, so disappointed, that product is good but I can't use it, I kept it for my brother"
Issue with battery üîãüîãüîã,4.0,Bass quality is good but I think little more this is a required the build quality is really very nice metal body but 8 I have one issue regarding battery in starting it give a really very good battery backup but if you charge more than its capacity it will give you less battery backup so do not charge more than 1 hour I am using that headphone from last 6 months now I have to charge that earphone more than two to three times in a day so before buying this earphone please look at more options
Fake/substandard quality product,1.0,I had been a Boat fan for long time and have multiple Boat headset at home with great build and experience. I have bought it from retail as well as flipkart and am sure got the genuine product which is evident with not just the quality but also the authentication barcode on all products except the one I got from Amazon. Please refer the screenshot attached which has to barcode marked in green white the one from Amazon is marked in Red.Product from Amazon not only has poor quality and build but also doesn't stay longer also not a great range which defeats the purpose of bluetooth headset as the phone has to be kept near the headset all the time.I have requested for replacement but will be very disappointed if I get similar product which is substandard quality or fake.
Worth & do go for it when needed.,3.0,W/L earphone in 1-1.5K price range. Handle carefully for 1st 1 week to understand different feature capability. Had many -ve reviews on Amazon but I still opted for it. Incidentally all is well till now after 1 month use. Little problem in call/audio management but that's not a major issue. Same feature of JBL is on higher price rande (4K) so not bad this one.
"Good for listening music, Worst for answering calls!",2.0,"The Sound quality is Good. And the battery is pretty decent as well. This may sound OK to hear songs, but this is not good for handsfree calls. Noise cancelation is very bad as we tend to hear the noise of external sorroundings most of the time. The person on the other line of the call gets irritated after a few mins of the call due to this failure in noise cancelation.In short : If you are looking for a handsfree earphone for music - This is good choiceBut, if you also looking for handsfree calls then this might really disappoint you considering the budget... Think twice before buying"
Malfunctioned within 25 Days of Purchase,1.0,"Wish boat had spend the amount of money/time/research on quality/sound/durability rather then spending on ads, celebrity endorsement and to get their label on IPL players caps. Bought after a lot of research but the earphones malfunctioned within 25 days of purchase, a static noise is coming from the earphones whether it's switched on or off, the warranty and customer care sucks, I can't take a 800 bucks cab ride to a service station for a 1400 rupees headphones that too with no guarantee of repair or replacement."
Bad product send by Worst Retailer,1.0,"This review is related with Boat Rockerz 255pro plus. Don't buy any products from ""Appario Retail Private Ltd."" They send box with broken seal and taped by local tape.They send me the product in bad condition already used by someone. It's looks old and very dusty.They steal accessories from the box, this product comes with 2 pair of Eartips but they send only 1 pair. Not happy with the Retailer. Don't waste your time, money and trust on ""Appario Retail Private Ltd."" They don't deserve it."
Superb sound and battery life,5.0,"Sound quality : Superb , you fall in love with music.Noise cancellation: I use them on bike and never got any problems. Yes not the next level but experience is good.Bass quality: Trust the fame of Boat u will never feel cheated and no requirement of using Equalizer the bass is so goodAt last i would say good lows and good highs .Go and buy them also looks good I bought blue you can also go for green .Remember if you want good battery life these are the best"
Awesome,5.0,"Very good sound quality. It is perfect for sports and also other purposes.Very good bass (if bass is not there download app bass booster you will get it)Noise cancelation is goodIt is given that battery backup of 6 hoursBut after i used it, i came to know that it can give a battery back up of 6 hours and more"
Review for 255 Pro. Awesome buy for price of 999 Go for it.,4.0,"Review for 255 Pro. Bought it for 999 , it's pretty good considering the price. Dont get fooled by the colors shown in the site, Teal Green isnt as bright as it is shown here. No issues till now. Yes amazon needs to work on its packaging. Packaging was worst. Earphone box was not sealed, n it ws bent bcz of bad packaging. 0 stars for Amazon Packaging.If u are tight on budget bt want a Good earphones go for it"
Dissatisfied,1.0,I'm extremely disappointed with this product. I bought it in September 2019. Since then I had to send it back to the company twice because everytime one of the earphones stops working. Both the times the company sent a new product but even then it barely works for 5-6 months and then the same problem is faced. Since it was under a warranty of 1 year the company easily changed it. But now that won't be possible. I just don't get it why a product worth 1500 had to be changed twice in a span of 1.5 years. I do not recommend this product. Dissatisfied
This headphones for songs listing not recommended for call,3.0,Good product for  song listening not for call it's a actually gym or exercise use headphones not for call peaking I used this product from last 12 days around i noticed some major cons in it when you call another person from this headphones make sure you stay in quite place coz this headphones mic pick each and every sound surrounding from your place so your speaking voice is not that much clear for your call person  overall one line review is very nice and high quality headphones for songs listing not for call
Certainly not for taking phone calls,3.0,"Overall quality is good, however it is certainly not the best choice to take phone calls. Have been using it for a while now and have noticed that noise cancellation is almost non existent and other end can barely hear even when there is slight noise around, works OK only if you are in absolutely noise free area."
Average product - buy only for wireless use.,3.0,"Just another average product from a brand that promises a lot. Meets the purpose of tangle free handling of earphones which otherwise provide better sound quality at 1/3rd the price of bluetooth earphones.Sound quality - like any other, don't expect too much. Just about clear. Average sound quality at mid volumes.Bass - Good bass punch. The clarity of the earphones don't compliment the bass well.I'm not a sound expert !"
Not value for money,1.0,"Didnt fit my expectations,sound quality is good but battery backup is pathetic never lasted more than half an hour on 100 % charge,moreover the range too isnt good.doesnt work for running as the fitting isnt great .packaging too was pathetic it had dust inside the package.Stopped working within two weeks,wareanty isnt smooth too,jun 14 se complaint daali hai no response.wasted my money"
Good at this price range,4.0,"BoAt rockerz. Very good at reasonable price Bluetooth earphone. Got it at Prime sale at Rs 999/-.Pros.Bass is good.Fits properly inside the ears.Cons.Pre configured voice that come while connecting / Disconnecting, or incoming call is not clear. May be bcoz of Male voiceüòú"
Value for money awesome bluetooth earphones,5.0,"Like the product completely, no complaints whatsoever. Sound quality, noise reduction, battery life(a few days with moderate use) all great. Prior to that, timely delivery, good packaging etc. Fully satisfied. Recommend to all."
Not worth,2.0,This is just an ok type product. Faced lots of issues while switching connection between laptop and mobile phone. Used it for few months but not satisfied. Finally got pissed off as it was not connecting while i was taking an important call from office through my laptop. Smashed it to ground and put it to dustbin where it should actually belong.
Better bluetooth range than other Boat earphones,4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by the bluetooth range this one had to offer. Deducting one star because the connection does get cut off all of a sudden when detected out of range, rather than fading (which would be helpful), and the functionality of long-press for 'on' and then connecting with your phone every time is a ridiculously time-consuming process.But great purchase, value for money."
Worth for the price.,5.0,"Looks but cheap but does the job just fine. Sound quality is good. The ear buds grip is not that great, it keeps falling even with additional support. I baught this for taking calls so cant really comment on bass or music quality."
Noise addition instead of cancellation,1.0,"I have a very bad experience in using this product. Whenever I talk over calls using this ear phone, person over call from other side always complain about heavy noise. Which distracts other person badly. I don't think it has noise cancelling feature even I think it adds unnecessary noise. Worst thing is that I can't return it because of Amazon policy."
Second time I got a fake one,3.0,"I've ordered two products last year and listening to the quality of the headset I ordered one more. However, the second one was duplicate. While connecting, is says till boat rockers (255 was missing). By the way the cover and the headset looks like the replica of the first one which I purchased.The sound quality and noise cancellation was perfect for the first oneüòä."
Not worth the bucks,1.0,"Writing this after  4 months of usage. Not any expert on earphones, just a layman trying to get a VFM Bluetooth headphones with some nice audio quality. No doubt boat rockerzz dissapoints to the core. The built quality is really bad one of the edges is already coming off. The battery caught and the coating started pelling off. The Bluetooth connectivity is also bad. There are gaps in the connectivity even when the phone is in my pocket.The only saving Grace is the bass in the audio.Bluetooth connectivity - 2/10Build quality - 1/10Audio quality - 6/10Value for money - not at all"
Boat Rocks !,5.0,"Writing after 1 months of rough use .Only get detached the rubber cap of charging point.Super compatible with my Samsung Grand 2 , Samsung M20 and Lenovo Lappy.Light weight.Super sound quality.  Same as JBL as I am JBL freak . Now a days JBL is giving bad cord for headphones... this one is good in 255.Only problem is the distance frequency is very very low.I purchased on Rs.999/- on sale.Better than other products as the round neck is not stiff so can listen while sleep too .Don't think too much just go for it .. not disappoint you ."
"Sound quality is disappointing , sound is so muddy and unclear. Wrost for those vocals",1.0,"If you love muddy sound and only want to hear bass ,yes you can waste your precious time and money on this earphones. My old nokia earphones were more clear in terms of soundIt looks like boat just increased the bass and forgot about every other thing.Watched some movies too and voice of actors was muffling as hellBut anyway i would say order one and check it ur self. Becoz you can return it back and get it back in Amazon pay."
Zero CVC... Frustrated with the product.,2.0,I have just ordered this headphone. Sound from the music apps and videos are good but on call it has a constant buzzing sound and CVC is ZERO. I thought to replace it but for some reason I couldn't. But still I felt to review it because I'm completely frustrated right now hearing all kind of complaints from those people whom I talk too through this earphone. It is not worth the price.Please let me know if this issue comes under manufacturing defect and I still can exchange/return it.
Won't last very long,3.0,Have been using for a year.Build quality is average... Wont last you very long. The buttons will start to fall off. One ear has stopped working for me.Was ok while it lasted. I would say not worth the money you would spend
"Nice product, if you are BASS lover then go for it.",5.0,"Nice product, worth it. Writing this review after 2 weeks, I have charged it twice.  It can long upto 5-7 days if use it on 50 -60% music volume. However sound quality is crisp and treble is also good. If you want base just raise the volume more than 50/% and enjoy the deep bass like home theater."
ROCKINGG!! ROKERZZZ 255 PRO,5.0,"Honestly telling, these earphones areee mind boggling!..ü•µ  ..The sound quality is just aawwwsomee! The battery backup is also too good üëçüëå.. and one thing if you are a bass lover you DEFINITELY gonna like them a lott! I repeat... A lotüôÉ !! the fit is perfect you can surely use them while doing any activity either walking, running, cycling etc and they won't fall of ...I personally liked them as I'm a big fan of BOAT and I use most BOAT accessories.. when I planned to get these they were new in the market but when I purchased them they were just fantastic and more than what I expected..overall fabulous product...you can close your eyes and just go for them ü§òüéß‚ù§"
If u would kindly replace my earphones would be great,2.0,Its been 8 months since i have baught this boat rockers 255 in the beginning it wos working perfectly fine after three months the battery started to degrade because when it was new its battery used to last for atleast 5 and a half hours atleast but after 3 months it used to last only for three hours and i had to charge it for atleast 2 hours so i started using other wired earphones for a while and now within this lockdown i decided to start using my boat earphones but now all of a sudden its right earpeace is only working and the left one has stopped to work so please kindly help me and replace my earphones.
Not upto the brand name,2.0,"I like Boat products especially their speakers, I have 2 of them and they have excellent connectivity but these headphones have terrible connectivity. Max range is 8-10m and clear sound only if there is no obstacle in between you and the phone but once there is a wall or anything else there's static sounds"
Excellent Product,4.0,"The earphones are sleek and not bulky around the neck. Give a really good sporty look. The sound quality is very nice and not harsh. Good bass and treble balance even when on full volume.Got this product during the Amazon sale on headphones. had ordered two earphone, one was defective; hence one less star in the overall review. The other one was in great condition. a good deal for the price."
Not value for money,1.0,Sound quality is not good and bass is also not good . Both thongs should be good as it is a boat earphones and it is rs 1500 . When i use this neck band boat rockers 255 pro in zoom meeting the sound  comes  low and when i use zoom and at a same time i use youtube sudio of zoom stops comming and the app which i use at a same time the audio of that app comes low .I thing in 1500 rs the bass and drivers should be good and there would be type -c cable .Really dissapointed .
"Awesome product, Love With Boat Rockerz 255",5.0,"It is an awesome, I really like it cause the sound quality. And the most important thing is that it won't trouble your ears if you wear it for a long as I tried most of the headphones, wireless Bluetooths most of them troubles me a lot if I put them into or on my ears for a long like 1 to 2 hrs. But this one is really awesome, the bass is superb, it won't fall down from your ears while running... Amazing product. Boat rocker 255 is really rocking as the name..... If I want to rate it so definitely it will be 5/5"
Horrible after sales service,1.0,"Guys, it's an honest review. I bought the earphone in 2019. It was working fine with minor grievances. After 10 months of usage, one of the sides stopped working. I applied for warranty. Boat people took my earphone and never responded. They neither returned my old earphone nor they exchanged it for a new one. Horrible after sales service. Better go for bigger brands, even if it costs a bit more."
Read this before buying,4.0,"I read most of the review's before buying this earphones and i ended up buying this amazing boat rockerzz, the sound clearity is okayish but oh man, the bass, it's amazing and the connectivity is brilliant, i walk from one room to another without taking my phone and it works flawlessly Without any glitch.The problem in most of the bluetooth earphone is you have to press and hold the power button for almost 3 second to turn it on and the same for turning it off or shuffling between songs which is annoying.Wire postioning is good but it can be better.The battery almost lasts for about 3 days if you use it fot 2 to 3 hours a day and the ear hooks are excellent for outdoor activities with this earphone.After all with my personal experience i can tell everyone that you can but this phone bluetooth earphone if you want good sound clearity, amazing bass, a decent battery life, and comfortable to use."
Worth it!! Maybe.. But...!!? Think about it.,3.0,"Everything about the earphones are really good. But jus that even the best products has the cons to it! So first off...,The sound Quality it's flawless and buttery smooth... But..! In an immerse content called the ""Extra Boost"" they've pumped up the Bass alone!? Where's the original bit of the song Ya'll!? üòë The bass is so dominant that the original bit of the song isn't present.Secondly.., if your are frequent user of the earphones.. I highly recommend not to go for it. After my extensive usage for about a week I found that the Backup charge in the device is horrible... And the most irritating thing is that it powers off at 20% (What the Heck) that's a true example of a poor Build. The battery doesn't even last for 3-4 Hrs of continuous playing.. But if your a timely user then this device might a perfect fit!"
Berybad quality of product.,2.0,The product is a worst quality of product. Automatically broken twice . No reply from boat. Amazon also not taken any responsibility after selling this type of 3rd grade product to their customer. Really horrible experience. Total money wastage.
Product delivered seems a used product!,3.0,"Find attached the photos, the box seal was open and also product was not packed properly. It seems some one has used it. Also the battery was fully discharged which was supposed to be fully charged and new product! Disappointed with the dealer plz do take a strict action on him. Attaching here the photos as proof!"
Worst product,1.0,Worst product. Sound not good and color also different which show in image .look like duplicate.after using 10days one side eartip broken.Worst product delivered  by amazon
I am using this product for past 1 years,1.0,"1. Mic stopped working  with 3 months2. Battery is dead after 9 months of usage3. Service center call number is not reachable and not responding for the message4, Not sure how we can drop to the service center during the COVD situation."
Magnetic switch off not working,1.0,"Since the magnetic touch off wasn't working, if was it really the new product or refurbished one. I finally returned. I didn't like the grip also, the earpiece extrudes out of ear unlike oneplus earphone. Oneplus ear grip is good. Realme 2 with new design is also good which is similar to oneplus in terms of ear grip. I cna give 3 star overall. Since product is defective, I'm giving one star."
Sound error,1.0,"Purchased a month ago for 999 , and when i used it for first time bass was awesome and sound quality was also good but when i watched a video whenever th sound of video reduces earphone automatically start givin tap tap sound and whem volume of video reaches below 20%  it didn't gave any sound i actually didn't knew if it was a technical error or something else so i returned it and purchased oneplus bass edition for 2k and believe me they are real beast as compared to these 255 pro."
"Good product overall , but might not be stable during running / work out",4.0,"Early reviewGood sound quality and builtHowever the c shape fixture on the buds, which has been designed to provide stability during work out serves only a theoretical interest . During running atleast my buds are slipping offI am ardering now the one which holds the ear  pinna"
boAt are very good brand,5.0,If you like bass than buy it superb bass but it's survive in low beats.Overall it's best item and justify price.By the way boat after sales service are damn good. If your earphone having any issue you need only log a complaint on website and upload proof of purchase they send courier person to pickup and they replace your earphone with sealed pack new within 10 days.
Great for such Price,4.0,Its the 4th day i am using boAt 255 pro and it is a great pair for such price . It has a good battery life and sound quality and bass is also good but only one this that it do get some statics on terrace if you have a mobile towers near by. And design is little uncomfy if you plan to use it for long hours. Rest all good üëç
Satisfied,5.0,"Superb product. Sound quality is impressive. It cancels out the bad sounds perfectly. Very easy to connect to any device. Compatable for android or smart tv also along with android, apple, windows devices also. Sound quality remains same even after 6-7 years. I would highly recommend this product."
Quality,4.0,This product has excellent quality and really very good design and sound quality. Battery life is very long. Overall if anyone wants to buy it go ahead.But I bought two products both have the same problem automatically disconnected during the call and when I watch any video or listening songs.I think this connectivity issue is a major issue in this product.
Well done boAtüëç,5.0,"Great Neckband. High base and sound is pleasant. Fantastic performance when Used it for calls inside room. Outside on road with less noise surroundings it works fine.Audio is great even in noisy atmosphere. Overall if you want awesome neckband go for it, and stay tuned on youtube channel Niraj Tech Show."
"Good for this price range, Best one you get",4.0,"One of fantastic earpiece in this price range, i got it for 899 from Great Indian Sale on Amazon.inSound quality is good but not best.Bass is good.Bluetooth connectivity is fine as i can use it anywhere in my home.Battery is good as it gives upto 5 hours playing music or talking. (ONE PROBLEM I DETECTED IS IT WON'T SHOW YOU HOW MUCH BATTERY REMAINING) as when fully charged it shows 100% in phone suddenly after sometime it shows 80% then after sometime it's on 60% thn it can be switched off anytime but exactly it will run for 5 hours.It gives warning of battery low at 20%Overall good product for this price range.It shows that it will give battery backup upto 6 hours but i find it will go upto 8 hours."
Uncommanded static in the left earphone.,1.0,"The earphone is good. But curiously uncommanded static creeps into the left earphone within a couple of days of use. I noticed this on two consecutive occassions. The initial earphone and also on the replacement earphone as well. Just short of returning the item, the left earphone completely stopped working. The uncommanded static turns into a whistling noise even when no bluetooth device or phone is connected to it."
Music lovers don‚Äôt look at it. Battery lover order now,3.0,I have received product today morning and writing review at afternoon..If you are true music lover and want out of the box sound experience don‚Äôt go for this ones check wired earphone which can deliver great sound at much lower price.If you want great battery life and descent sound experience with good specs like water certification get this one.Overall deal is fine in 1500.
It has sporty look and easy to carry while running,4.0,"The sound quality is very good, obviously don't expect so much bass.In terms of look, it is very much attractive.Charging and power back up also promisable. Hoping for long lasting .But worst part is about noise distortion while talking. Other side of the phone party keeps complaining about outside noise."
Good Value for money,4.0,Gets 7-8 hours on full charge . It been 2 months since i bought this.PRO'sValue for money (i bought it for 950 rupees)Bluetooth connectivity is good.Dedicated button for pause /play/on/off/google assistant (same button different duration of time)another 2 buttons for volume up/down /next/ previousCreates a vacuum in ear.Properly fits.CONsHurts ear if you wear it for long time .Creates audio that is irritating when you put volume to mute.Charging still done through micro usb port and not type-c.Build Quality not for workout just wear at a desk.
Awesome,5.0,I never give 5 star rated to any product. This is the first time I am rated 5 star because I am high satisfactory.Already bought 2 qty and waiting to buy one more...Pros:Batter: unbelievableMic: soooperbAudio: awesomeCons:NothingSuggestions:The position of volume + - button can be interchanged
EARPHONE CABLE IS TOO LONG üòèüòèüòè,1.0,NO DOUBT PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD BUT EARPHONE CABLE IS TOO LONG THATS WHY I M UNHAPPY WITH THIS . PLS BE CAREFUL WHEN U BY YOU CANT RETURN. U CAN ONLY REPLACE.
Not really impressed,3.0,I have few pros and cons. Don't know what others are reviewing.Pros:+ Good battery life+ Good bass+ Good sound quality for musicsCons:- Bad quality of sound for other on voice call- voice assistant not working- while connecting two phones very bad music voice sometimes cutting sounds in-between
Good product. Go for it.,5.0,"It's really a good earphone. Amazon provided a great delivery, I got my product just on the next day of ordering it. I bought it for 1099 during the sales and I must say it is the best wireless earphone I have used. The functions,  Battery life,  audio quality everything is just awesome.Ione drawback is that, boat is supposed to provide a carrying case with it.  It's really risky to put it in the bag or somewhere else.  Otherwise it's the best product."
Good for sound quality,4.0,"After 6 months of usage i'ld say it has min 4-5 hrs of continuous battery for 100-0%. But when it comes to noise cancellation that's tricky, i mean noise from your side is made high for other person and you'll be safe from other person's noise. Sad part is its connectivity with two devices does not work as mentioned by the company. There are even rare chances  with single devices it irritates with sudden on and off connection during the call.Overall for a normal usage its better product. i wish if there is any improvement in battery life"
Do not buy this product.,1.0,"Super sound qualitybattery life was good around 6h and takes 1.5 h to make it fullreally like the productAfter 7 months of usage right side of the ear speaker not working,i send it for warranty claimon July but till date there is no update about the product and services,Service center is in mumbai so if the product is  send for service it will take around 3 months may be more to repair it or replace it.Think again to purchase or not to purchase,I suggest you people should purchase the product that the service center is in your home town, Go for other product.Thank you"
A Great product but...,4.0,"Product is great in every aspect but it packs the ear and make a bit uncomfortable... Overall great product... But if you would like to go for walk or gym then prefer ear buds .. These are pretty good for home purpose , and moreover you can't lay down with it .... So , think before buying . I am myself suffering with my choice as I didn't went with ear buds ..Overall product is good and decent ... I have already used it for 3 months."
Best to buy in this range!! Honest review,4.0,"All in all this could be the best wireless earphone in this range !!!!Although it has some pros and con for which boat can overcomePros-~the sound quality is so soothing~ texture of bass is properly splited for both side .~ built quality is also good , you can feel the toughness of the product.~design and color texture is also fine.~Cons~ battery is not uo the mark in one charge i.e within 45min full charge battery the output u can expect is 2 n half hour if u using it continuous or by keeping standby or with a call u can expect 2days battery backup.~ the upper layer of the body leaves the material i mean thing poly coating gets automatically removed"
Product is good but the rubber earbud tip is of low quality,2.0,"Product is good but the rubber earbud tip is of low quality. within 1 month it got teared and with normal use only. Instead of rubber tip boat can provide silicone tip which will have long life. Other wired boat models have silicone tip, but this wireless comes with rubber tip which is pathetic"
Betrayed,1.0,I bought the product as the reviews were good. I even liked it as it is a descent one. It was the price point I thought was little higher Rs 1699 but then I thought that it being a Branded product hence the price could be high.What I am regretting right now is that I bought it at 1699 and within 2 weeks the price has dropped to 999.I feel like betrayed.
Horrible battery life !!,1.0,If u think of some bad product's I've got. This is one of the top ones. Got the new one which died a week after the return date passed. Sent it for repair and got the replacement after 4 weeks which worked for less than a week.  Sent it back again and got it after 4 weeks which worked a little more this time and lasted for 3-4 weeks and the battery is gone again. The battery doesn't last for more than 30 min no matter what I do. Charged it for a few mins and hours and neither made a difference
"Not Good Sound lag, Dont recommend to buy.",3.0,"Sound quality is good, but when I keep the phone in the pocket there is a lag in every 6-10 sec which is not good and make the product among all the available option, got the product seal in open seal condition, Giving 2 star because the sound quality is good and one for the amazon superb service. If I got a good quality then I will update my review about the new one. After replacement Provided the good wireless earphone , but they also lag sometimes,Superb service by Amazon.I recommend Dont buy this..."
You should just go with it . Perfect buy for the price .,5.0,"Perfect product to buy right now . Live up to the 40 hours battery life mark . And previously I was using the one plus bullet wireless but I had one issue with that one that my ears use to pain after 1 hour of continuous usage but no such issue with this one , I have used it to as long as 4-6 hours continuous. Really liked it ."
Awesome product in this price range,5.0,"A very good neckband bluetoth earphone . The battery back up is excellent with ASAP charging . As usual boAt sound --very nice but some hiss noise during call . Bass is superb.But it feels heavier on ears , however the quality of wire is good and flat wire. boAt should give pouch for carrying during travel."
No doubt go for it..100% Worth value.,5.0,"After all trails waxed up with high priced bluetooth devices like (bose),JBL Sony...As a lost trail I purchased boat ...as my friends r saying it's good but the price was low compare with others including Samsung level 3 ....but my first look ...its cathy and tried with my I phone and android it's great in sound.....at present if it stays like that for 1yr..also I ll b happy ..."
Very Satisfying product üòÄ,5.0,"First of all I like the fast delievery of amzon it delivered before expected ,This is very very super at bass and has nice sound quality .‚Ä¢It is very satisfying at design‚Ä¢It is Perfect for all the requirements .‚Ä¢You can use it for gaming ,listening songs, Doing online class ,office meetings ,etc.‚Ä¢ And this product has a nice build quality.‚Ä¢ My opinion is to just go for it..."
Needs to fix connectivity issue...,2.0,"After using 6 months this bluetooth m writing this review,Pros.It's cheaper than its competitorsHas 3hrs battery backup for musicFor calls it lasts half day on avg.ConsConnectivity with xiomi/ Samsung phones is an serious issue, I have xiomi note 6 pro and samsung M30s and Note 10 this device has issue with all devices but it works well with samsung tablets."
Surprised by the audio,4.0,"I was actually in dilemma in buying this or MI. But took a chance. Surprisingly i didn't go wrong. As samsung phones has mild low sound output, even i these mobiles it sounded far excellent. Then i tried with MI, honor and other mobiles. It was outstanding. Bass punched my ears so good. High and mid tones was good but not awesome. Call quality is just fine. Overall best earphone for budgeted. Just go on, u will never get unpleasant."
Not the best but good for the price they come in.,3.0,"I've now used this product for over a month.Sound quality is good.Mic is good.Major problem is during calls, even if a spoon falls near you the other person would hear it as a loud thunder. It catches lot of noise. Sometimes I've to remove earphones and then continue the call.Fit is little weird. Right side ear plug keeps popping out."
Boat is my family member now... üòÑ,3.0,"I have 7/8 boat earphones including headphone, its impressive. Worth each penny. Best sound quality. Bass. Noise cancellation. Microphone is okay. Long lasting battery if you are buying Bluetooth model. And affordable."
Left side earpiece low volume,1.0,I didn't realise it initially maybe but on the 10th day I may say it that the left earpiece has about 60% volume of right one.This is not expected. Also they refuse to replace at boat center.
Average product and poor after sale service,3.0,"U really need to vigilant when it comes to boat wireless,I bought this three months back.Initial all aspects looks good and it's gradually decreased in value.Dual Bluetooth won't worked for me. I enquired with my fellow guys who bought this after me. Even they too find difficult in connecting two devices ie lap and mobile.Later after lot of search, it worked and every time it made me to do the same process to get connected.The mic is outside below Bluetooth and not inside ie near mouth, so it receives all the outer noise around you and your voice will not audible to the receiver end.Bass is little low when compared with boat 225 wired headset.Don't know how much charge utilized and always shows 80% and suddenly shows warning and switched off.After two months of use, The earpiece wire got disconnected / tore on the right side ie Bluetooth side. When contacted Amazon, they told to register the product inorder to claim warranty. Also they told to look out for near service centre where we can change our product.But in Chennai, no such stores available the nearest service centre is at Bangalore. The same reported to Amazon again, I was advised to look out of shops in local market area(Richie Street). I have told them that my product was registered in website and I didn't get any confirmation or registration code to activate or claim my warranty.They asked me to search contact numbers in boat website and proceed further.Twice I have  registered the product andIt's been a month they(boat) have not  acknowledge and send registeration code@AmazonU really need to look into this and arrange for replacement from your end as the manufacturer is not prompt in the registration process. Better u can arrange for replacement from the seller side which would ease the consumers difficulty"
Value for money,5.0,"First, let me mention that I got this product at Rs 999 during sale. The build of the product is average and the magnet holding the two earpieces is average. When it comes to sound quality, these are perfect for listening songs and movies in surround sound. However, the only area that the product lacks is the microphone's performance on a call. You'll often hear the other party complaining that they can't hear you, instead the background noise takes centrestage. So avoid using them for calling in busy, noisy areas, otherwise they work fine in quiet environments. Hope the product price drops to 1000 Rs mark permanently."
Disappointed with product design,1.0,"Sound quality is great and good bass, but disappointed with product design. Volume up/down tone is played whenever there is a change in audio stream. Example while scrolling Facebook and Instagram videos page, Volume up/down tone is played each time before start of the video. This is very irritating, looks like product design fault. I have observed this on my iPhone 6+, not sure about Android behavior.Note: this is behavior observed after device volume control is used."
(again update) earphone stopped working but got replaced within no time.(color change extra 150 Rs),5.0,"I was nervous while purchasing this earphone based on all reviews i read. but im so happy that i purchased it.Its too good1) sound is too good.2) fits perfectly in ears, as it provide three ear buds with different size.3) bass is so good.4) EDM music lover will love it.5) Can connect two device at a time.problems :1) Bluetooth connectivity problem you may face initially, but if you switch off earphone and mbl bluetooth, and again on it it will work. Once it connects your device you wont face connectivity problem.Customer service:1) Really happy to say that i had issue regarding bluetooth connectivity, after raising complaint i got fast reply from boat people, even though issue was resolved, i was keep getting calls from baot people for issue.2) you can replace item within no time, service is too goodps: i have never written this much big review for any product."
Battery backup and sound,5.0,Battery of this product is very long performing. I am continuously use this earphone for a week but battery is still remain approx 20%.Bass quality is good and noise cancellation button is effective after 2 sec of pressing the button....some little calling issues are in this product but very little...range of Bluetooth connectivity is sufficient not any issue...so end of this review is product is best in this prize  range üëç
"Poor for calls, Ok for  Musicüéµüé∂",1.0,"Poor sound quality, has cracking sound always throughout calls. Good for listening music, but absolutely rubbish product for calls.. Connects instantly with devices. Never had a smooth calling experience with this headset yet after almost a month's use.. Disappointed with the product keeping in view the price paid for the product.. üòî"
A quality product,5.0,"I use it mostly for calls. It's my second boat product and there is no doubt in my mind about the quality of their products. Sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality are best at this price range."
Excellent product,4.0,"Boat is awesome if you like to hear bass's and quality.I am using one plus 6 and quite satisfied with boat. In case of audio controlsDouble tap + button to increase volume & single tap for change next track.Double tap - button to decrease volume & single tap to previous track.Double tap o or middle button to dial last call, single tap 2 seconds for Google assistant, single tap immediate to play or pause music, single tap long press to on or off boat rocker or Bluetooth connectivity.If u charge daily 20 minutes it's enough for long day continues music.Overall Good product."
A must buy @ 999 Rs.,3.0,"I would say at this price (999 Rs.)  it's a must buy product.Pros - 1. Bluetooth connectivity is really good, I kept my phone at bedroom and was at hall and the sound was clear.2. Mic and noise cancellation working really fine.3. Flexible and durable.4. Sweat Proof.Cons.The only con is that it's sound quality was damn good in iPhone but in Android it's quite normal like other basic headphones.  As I have iPhone 7 and Android phone,  I prefer to listen to songs by connecting with iPhone as it is giving good support to this headset."
Don't buy if you love clear bit loud-audio.,1.0,"Bad audio quality !Very ambiguous sound. Horrible audio level. Bass is a joke.Noise cancelation- i was able to hear everything apart from music.Sound level is absolutely nonsense, you'll keep struggling to raise the volume all the time.Very cheap product also control are on right side, BIG NO FOR ANY BIKE Rider."
Not something that people rejoicing.,2.0,"After more than two months of usage i am reviewing this product.It's third month and start creating problem. I mean bluetooth connectivity. Very low. Noice cancelation is also not upto mark.Sound is good no doubt but lacking tow big things, durability and Bluetooth connectivity.Noice cancellation not all up to the mark. Can say ""chal jayega"" type."
Good on for those who loves bass,4.0,"Vocal is not Cristal clearIf u want to listen clear vocal u have to download 3rd party software. And  if u use Samsung m series like m10,20 or 30 phone than there is no need to download 3rd party SOFTWARES,BASS IS REALLY VERY VERY HIGH.if u are a bass lover and u can compromise little with vocal than it's for you and if u can't compromise with vocal even 10%  than I won't suggest to u"
"Nothing great, average performance in line with the low price",4.0,Decent voice and connection speed. These are not bose so do not expect a thumping bass or a sharp treble. Noise cancellation is almost non noticable. But ok for the price as i use mainly for office calls and occasional movie/ music
Poor reliability product. Doesn't work even after sending for repairs twice.,1.0,"DO NOT BUY. First 3 months of use was fine, working normally and getting good battery life as well. After this period one day it suddenly did not turn on. Sent it for BoAT service repair and received it back after two weeks. After the repair was working fine for one month, then again same problem. It did not power on. Sent it for boAt repair again but got it back only after some 3 months because of pandemic lockdown. Was working fine for another month but now it doesn't work again. The blue light is always on, but it does not connect to any device and the buttons don't seem to work. Very poor quality product. Sad to see this condition after seeing it sent for repairs twice."
Stopped working after first charge,1.0,"The most pathetic product I ever saw by far. Not just once but even after replacement same issue seen. It worked fine when it was fully charged on delivery. But once on low battery when I tried to charge it again, it never comes up again even after full charge. Also on the left side of earphone, it constantly gives irritating noise even without connection to any device. Now I am not able to replace this junk since time is over. I should get my money back for this garbage of a product instead of replacement actually."
Waste of money,1.0,Dumbest thing I have ever used I have been a big user of boat head sets since a verylong time this time the headset gets disconnected frequently charging problem  it doesn't even let you manage the battery life it shows high and sudden says battery low... Please  don't buy boat rockerz 255 pro
Very disappointed,2.0,Not happy 2nd time purchased it seems look like duplicate even the connection voice and accessories not original all fake not happy with amazon please take necessary action against suppliers who provide duplicate products very disappointed
This crap stopped working within 6 MONTHS!,1.0,"I have bought this absolute piece of plastic! on sep 2019. which stopped working within 6 months ie.. during march, see don't buy this, no matter whatever sound quality this plastic gives, whats the point if it stops working within such a short period of time. I thought only i am unlucky, i found same thing happened with my friends too! please don't waste your money on this piece of plastic you can get way more better sound quality than this in many other earphones which are not like a plastic toy, that too in similar or little bit higher price. Meanwhile i gave this earphone to my father also and even he is saying that left part of earphone stopped working, trust me guys this plastic works flawlessly during first 6 months or less, after that it sucks!"
One ISSUE but the performance covers it up.,4.0,"Sturdy product but have a connectivity issue. Sometimes the Bluetooth doesn't recognise my boatrockerz I have to restart the phone to make it work. That's annoying but other than that the product is awesome, always have a pleasure using boats audio system. Using it for a year and the sound never dissatisfied me. Go for it"
Battery Life is So Good,4.0,Previously I was having Boat Rockerz 255 ..it's was good...after that I bought Oppo encho m31 ..it's sound and fitting was good but I had to give it 2 times to service station...so I bought this and overall for daily commniting and entertainment I found this is good..it's having so  good battery life...sound quality is not like oppo but it's ok..
not a good product,1.0,returned it once and got it replaced because it was hanging an not connecting. the replaced one also worked for few days then stopped charging. in both the earphones was having trouble in talking on phone as i could here but my voice was not transmitted on other side. some issue with software i guess cos at times it was ok and at times only one way
Boat Earphones,1.0,"Dont buy BOAT earphones at all,  i had facing a  problem with wireless and wired earphones. All of them are working similarly only one channel sound is getting properly the other channel is getting very low. I am experiencing this problem after a month of buying this products."
They are pretty damn good considering the price,4.0,"You really should buy these coz the battery life is awesome .Voice is decent , could have been even less audio leak which would have resulted in much better sound ,but sound is decentMicrophone is also good.Build quality is good idk but in my product there was small gap where the led was there which leaks the light whenever the signal is given .. It is a manufacturers problemOverall it deserves to be accepted instead of just blindly buying random studd"
Good quality product in an affordable price,5.0,"I just love this headset. I‚Äôve used many other big brands before this. But most of them don‚Äôt have noise cancellation and also there used to be some echo. In the boat headset, noise cancellation is really good. There is no echo. Also the price is not high. It is quite affordable. The only thing is that the battery discharged within 6 hrs of usage. For me this is not an issue as I just use it for calls. If your usage doesn‚Äôt exceed more than 6 hrs a day, you can totally go for it"
Good Product,4.0,"Hey I am using this product for last 10 days. Below is my experience.1. Sound quality is good with nice base.2. Comfortable in wearing and can be weared for long hours.3. Battery life is average.4.  Worst part is bluetooth connectivity, frequent disconnection. Organization must work on this problem."
Only the cost matters,4.0,"It's cheap so it's good. Nothing special. Wat else you get in less than 1800. Do not expect a high quality performance. But if you are ready to spend some more bucks, then I suggest sennhizer neck band. The sound quality is 100 times better than boat"
Good Only for music. Not for calls.,3.0,"Giving review using after 2 weeks. Too Long wire & neck wire bit hard, I tied to stick with a pin to hold the headphones. not in good flexible condition, not comfortable to wear. I  for calls not good, better for music. Battery time also not in 40hrs effect. But quick charge is good."
Dont prefer this for I phone,4.0,This is really good quality product. But I bought this for my I phoneXR. As we know already apple will perform good only with another apple. This has perfect external noise cancellation for the user but the con is this abosrbs external noises too much that disturbs a lot to the other end speaker. For songs this will shout a lot which may create even pain or itching in ears. Battery back up and water resiatnce quality was appreciable.
Connectivity issue is the main problem with this device other wise it's best product,3.0,"I used this model with from 1 month issue with the connectivity ,when it's connected there should be lots of overheads while listening the music I don't that's because of the bluetooth version and built quality is good but I think need some work on the connectivity software otherwise product is good and sound quality is good but some time the device is connected but still not able to attend the call again need to pair and all those things that's pathetic and feels irritated"
"Good Product, But !!!",3.0,"I have been using this product for exactly 40 days now, and this is what i have to say :Good product for the money; But,1. Takes too long to connect or disconnect to a device.2. The Battery is its biggest con, It never really gives 6 hours of usage. And on top of that, the battery drops from 60% to 20% or less in less than 40 mins... after which it starts interrupting your music stream saying "" Battery Low"".And the charge time is more than 2 hours, which is difficul to understand, given that it has a very small battery.Other than that, the product is fine."
Amazing Headphones,5.0,"Comfortable fit n good sound. My device stopped charging abt 4 months after purchase. I followed the online instructions to repair / replace the item as it was under warranty. Must say boat has a very impressive online system which is efficient n responsive. The service centre took some time but i have received my earphones back hence the 5 star rating. All electronic items can malfunction but its the after sales service that really determines the serious ones and from this it appears that boat are here for the long run. Good sound, comfortable fit, great after sales what more could one ask for."
Worth it.,5.0,"Great product. Got it for a price of 999 only.Range- As mentioned in product descriptionSound- Quality is good unless you are a die hard music lover or music creator.Might hurt your ears on extensive use.Good for rough use.Battery life-6hrs(verified)I personally use it for working out, watching movies and listening to songs.Great value for money ."
Questions regarding build quality??,2.0,"Purchased this in June 2021, completely died in Jan 2022. Wont turn on or charge, have contacted boat support for warranty, will update this review based on how they handle warranty claim. Sound wise, it is average at best and it suited my needs perfectly. Quality wise, well its not working after barely half a year of not much usage so that leaves a lot to be desired. Customer service now remains to be seen."
Garbage product boat rockerz 255,1.0,Biggest mistake to buy such kind of product. Boat products can never be trusted. These products have life equivalent to their warranty period or sometimes much lower than that. If u want to waste your money for a product that has shelf life of 6 months u can go for this stupid product. I purchased it in June last year and its battery life got damaged within 5 months. I replaced the product from the service centre which is quite far from my home and again it got damaged with similar issue within 2 days. Boat should stop making such garbage products. Beware of this trash is you value your money. Either go for a reputed brand which might cost more but have a good shelf life.
"WORST MIC , SOUND QUALITY .NOT AS EXPECTED , DONT BE  DECIEVED BY ITS TAGS FAKE COMMENTS....",2.0,Many reviews I read positive but... When I bought & used .. there is no extra bass jus as normal earphones... The worst part is MIC... It takes all the other noises except voice.. as a musician.. I can say it is a  normal earphones . There are no clear highs & mids & low... I prefer music lovers to buy Realme some what ok..better than this.. for a decent Bass & Good quality in Stereo HD sounds better for 8Dgo for Infinity  glide 500  cheap & best..
Slightly disappointed..,4.0,"Got it for Rs.999 at Amazon Day sale. Using it for last 2days. If compared with my old Boat 225 earphone, sound quality is almost same. But the bluetooth connectivity is really disappointed.  It's getting disconnected very frequently... Even within 6-7mts. Noice cancellation is just ok. It's very light weight and very much comfortable."
Noisy Microphone,1.0,"1. Something is really wrong with Bluetooth tech.The pairing gets interference with wifi signals of other devices like when it‚Äôs placed near another phone/ ipad. FYI: I use 2.4/5Ghz dual band router.2. The microphone picks only noise more often than  voice. It‚Äôs annoying for the person on call.Picks up the noise of fan/ vehicle honking/ breath/ wind etc., but usually NOT the VOICE."
"Bass is good, looks are good, mic is awesome but treble is less.",4.0,"Earphone's capsule look and feel is good but the wire is a bit long, when you hang it in your neck, it looks weirdly long but except that, the bass lovers would love this, good high volume, extra realistic bass and mic quality is awesome. Battery backup will amaze you, just charge it 100 once in weekend and it will assist you for the whole week. This is a real deal if you are getting this under 1500. Go for it.Rating 4* because of only upto 17khz treble. üî•"
Worst product and worst customer service from boat,1.0,I wnated to rate it zero but the interface don't have that option. Worst product I have purchased. I have replaced the product bec it stopped working and the same problem with the replaced unit. And still the product has not completed 1year. Worst noise cancellation. If you ask the other person on the call what they hear is only external sounds and that to very clearly. If you call boat customer care they tell ticket id is not valid. What the hell!You won't be able to contact the customer care executive
KILLER SOUND QUALITY ‚ö°üî•üî•,5.0,"Just go for it guys !! This neckband will not disappoint you !!Pro -Superb & clear sound quality.

Waste of money,1.0,"Forcefully am giving single star. Waste of money, no battery back up and audio quality not clear, if audio not playing automatically showdown within 7-8 minutes. First time am facing problem with Amazon they mentioned 30days return policy am received product on 04th Oct and am booked retrun on 10 Oct they mentioned 12th oct they will pick a product and now it's showing 11th Oct closed return policy, first time am facing problem with Amazon product."
The Worst Earphones Ever,1.0,"First of all,, This review is about Boat Rockerz 255 Bluetooth earphone. Generally , I don't have the habit of writing product reviews but this s*** earphones made me review this in order to save the other consumers who are planning to buy this CRAP. In my opinion ,,Firstly , An earphone should be comfortable to wear. In this regard,, it makes you to cry in pain even after 5 minutes of usage !! Secondly , it should have a good audio Quality !! It's just okayish when it comes to sound quality, Nothing great to talk about it. Overall, Never buy this earphone even if they give it for free unless if you wanna hurt your ears with this abysmal earphones."
Nice product,5.0,"Good quality sound. But magnets are not strong enough to hold together, they separate when shaker a little. But all over it is good. Bass, mid-range, treble all range of sound is covered very nicely. And the best is is battery (omg! 40 hrs@70%)."
Nice product and worthable,4.0,Only to sae battery little bit weak and the finiahing of rubber material is very goid also i using in rain season not at all problme also sweat happens no effect  or damage occur to headphones very nice auperb headphone.rest sound  of bass and treble sound is awesome  i buy from amazon.in thanks amazon . From.chepas headphones better buy this one I recommend to all..
Excellent for music not so good for calling..,4.0,"Product is excellent,,,but one problem is mic is not capture the words properly..so for calling it is not so good,you have to speak louder otherwise nothing will hear to recipient.........sound quality is so good,i am enjoying as INOX .......... battery charging very fast and run for 5-6 hr.....with my vivo mobile charger its get charged within 10 min.........so good for music not so good for calling...."
Good sound quality and bass,4.0,"I really loved this product.I m happy with this one. It has a very good sound quality & bass. Really enjoy when a rocking music i play becoz of bass. Design is also good. Earbuds are comfortable.Little heavy as it a metal but ok. Neck band is awesome. But sound quality get distorted when  simultaneously 2 sound means i in cls my teacher saying something and when i play music on background, at that time sound quality get bit low. Thats something but overall its a good one."
Problems only after few months use.,1.0,Loses power within 3-4hr.Loses charge without use within a day.LED indicators are not turning off.People can hear my voice when in call using headphone.Very sad with these boat head phones. Did not expect this from boat.Edit:  Boat gave me a new replacement.. But charging stopped after a few day... Why am I getting all the defective ones üò©
Decent product but....,4.0,"Good product. Decent sound, but Little too much of bass that it reduces the brightness of the high frequencies.Wish it sat flush in your ear but has quite a bit sticking out but that's ok.Battery life is good.Easy setup and access with the controls on the side"
Good one,4.0,Not up to the mark.. but not so bad either.. bass is good.. sound quality is okay.. if you use regular basis.. you might not get any trouble but if you want to focus on the beats of music or any sound very closely the it isn't so good at it..Noise Cancellation and bass also not so good.. but it  is also okey.. as I said for regular activity it is good but when you want to go inside any sound thoroughly then.. it won't be so helpful..
You're now connected to rockers piece of crap!!!!! [DONT BUY this thing is EARRAPE],1.0,"I use Sennheiser 3.0 for my laptop, got these for my phone.Headphones will tell you every time you connect your phone it says this stupid line.This thing is EARRAPE every time you connect and doesn't stop there, it'll also scream in your ears when the battery is low.Also, it says it on full volume like your ears gonna torn apart.Will never buy boat crap ever again, the worst experience EVER!!!!will NEVER recommend this company to anyone ever."
Not at all good,1.0,I bought this and returned it the same day..  Bass and sound output is pathetic. SUCH PRODUCT FROM BOAT IS REALLY a Disappointment . Poor BT reception.  Guys go for BOULT instead. Iam using that and really happy with it.
"Black in place of Neon Green , but its still okay for me.",1.0,"Update:One side of the earpiece stopped working permanently - 18June2020.Need to return and ask for replacement.I received a pure black piece in place of neon green with black and it seems to be slightly defective. Extra ear buds are also not provided as promised.At times one side of the ear phone isn't working, after head shake it suddenly continues to work.In terms of sound quality, it is good. Crisp and clear audio. Battery back up is also fine. May be need to continuously use to understand its working efficiency and long life durability."
Product could be robust !! But not,3.0,Product is ok ok. Sound is ok.Quality of wire is questionable !As i red circle weakest part of the  product. Donot know how long it will be durable ?Possible wire cut or damage in long run since it is always get repetitive bend while placing on neck and removing. However i will try to treat this part very carefully.But this area could be robust.
Decent only,4.0,"Don't expect more for what you have paidPros1.decent built quality(go for black)2.awsome battery backup3.noise cancelationCons1.music experience is not that much great2.bass is low compared to other brands at this segmentAt last if you have a plan to buy it for your regular office use then consider it,if you are looking for music bliss the go for 330 or 335 for better experience"
Battery drains out in 1.5 hours,2.0,"The battery drains real fast, exhausted in 1.5 hours. Unlike other headphones, it still keeps running even when the earbuds are locked with each other. And there's often this disturbance during calls and I have to switch to earpiece.Sound quality is decent so alright for listening to music but there's still the battery issue."
Warranty cannot be claimed. It's a scam,1.0,This product warranty is a scam.When I mailed I get a auto reply . I checked the website and reached the nearest customer service but they said they won't work on it and gave a number. When I tried the number it was not reachable.Very disappointed that there is no customer service for product related complaints. Better don't buy this product
Not happy with this product,3.0,"I have been using it since last 5months , recently it has got some problems. Some times not getting charge, sudden discharge and key buttons not working. I am not happy with this product. It has got 1 year warranty, but helpline phones not working and website also not working properly. Any one advise me in this regard."
Must read,3.0,"If you are a Bass lover you will love it, but if you are not then don't go for it. If you are a student who will use this earphone for a lecture or listen a human voice then It not for you, Trust me bass will trouble you if you are listing to lecture or human voice you cannot listen to it for hours rather go with normal earphone which don't have high bass I choose Oppo encho M31, its good"
Nobody is able to hear what I'm say,1.0,"I received my Boat Rockerz 255 yesterday. The earphones quality and sound is good. I'm able to listen to music/movies...etc. Sound quality is really nice.But during the audio and conference calls, I'm able to hear other parties correctly but nobody is able to understand what I say. My voice completely cracks/distorts. It's very embarrassing especially during office conference calls. I had to switch to my wired headsets.I need to return this product and need my refund."
Poor After sale service,3.0,"I am writing this review for after sale service, Headphone is outstanding for everything but after 6 month one side is suddenly stopped nd after that I am Continusoly trying to contact from April 2020 to till date to contact BOAT customer care but their phone nd office both are still closed,not getting any support from Boat and not even getting proper reply from Amazon customer care after calling so many times. I thought due to COVID 19  they closed their shop but  after july 20 everything started And now My warranty will be expire in September 2020. I don't know whether they help me Or not for this issueüòîüòî"
Awesome apart from BT Range (4.1),4.0,"Well, initial impressions are good. Got it for around rs 870 applying discount. The Amazon advertisement page showsBT 4.2, but the seller is selling BT 4.1. Previously was having JBL Infinity Glide 100, well those were having pretty below average sound quality, however the Bluetooth range in those was good (BT 5.0) , so returned them.These Boat Rokerz have awesome sound quality, however the Bluetooth range (4.1) is not that great but can't complaint more considering the price nd sound quality.Noise Cancellation remains to be checked. Build quality is superb.(I got Black nd my frnd got Neon, well Neon colour is looking super awesome. Buy Neon colour if u buy these)Will update after using for few more days."
Worth Earth phones for given cost,4.0,"I have been using boat rockerz 255 pro+ last four months.The most likeable part is,1. charge duration is very long. I am charging earphones weekly once. I am using earphones for at least 5hours per day in the week.2. Sound quality is good.3. The way they made earphones it is easy to use it. Most of the earphones doesn't stay in my ears. Now they create proper shape keep it in ears.4. weightless"
Awesome sound quality...........worth buying it....,5.0,"Hello Guys,This is Moorthy Shettiyar......After watching en number of videos & reviews I ordered this product yesterday at 10:00pm and today in the afternoon at 12:30pm I got the product.....very fast delivery........keep it up Amazon & teamNow let's talk about the product....First of all the quality of the product is awesome.....It's superb durable......nice tangle free cable....also I love that magnetic bounding between each other.....Now let's talk about the sound & call quality....Sound signature is literally superb guys It's beyond to my expectations...I was planning to buy realme buds wireless but I thought let's give it a try & really guys m very much impressed with the sound quality.....For sound signature I would rate 10 /10.Highs, lows, mids, vocals and bass everything is Crystal clear ....It's worth buying  @999/- I strongly recommend to buy this product it won't let u down...Boat rocks‚Ä¶................"
95/100,5.0,"Finding trouble while phone call....people on the other side asking to talk again...as the voice is not clear as it could be understood on first instance. Best for listening songs and waaltchig movie... However, lag in audio while watching movies."
Average,2.0,Average product .....Pros :- battery life- noise cancellation- pretty good sound quality for this priceCons:- very irritating earbuds (painful)- wire is long and looks weird on the front not at all stylish
Bluetooh connectivity is horrible.,2.0,The boat wireless/bluetooth connectivity has a serious issue. I was using boat wired headphones and it worked well for me. But in wireless section boat does not justify its presence.The wirelss headphons tends to disconnect  intermittently after few minutes and ruin the experience. Not worth it guys.
Not satisfied,1.0,"This is my worst purchase from Amazon. After reading the reviews I thought it‚Äôs going to be good; however first delivery there was charging issue as the charging point was broken and in exchange the second delivery is again defected as the charging remains for only one hour and even if fully charged battery get drained in switch off mode also within few hours.I am really sorry that I bought this..could be the seller issue also, over experience is not good"
This product is best for battery backup. The backup is,5.0,This product is best for battery backup. The backup life is so good . It's not 40hours that mentioned in the title but not less than about 25-30hours . The sound quality is good but espected bass is not required what is need . And product is 100% water proof which I have been tested and material quality is best . It's purely value for money product . In my opinion you just go for it . But remember that if u need much bass and musical thump you can watch also others .
Exceptional  after sales service from Boat,5.0,I am hugely surprised with after sales service from Boat. This earphone was bought about 10 months before and was in warranty. One side of the earphone stopped working about a month back. I reported this issue to Boat customer care. It was pretty seamless experience right from picking up and getting replacement for the earphone. Boat has set great example of after sales service for other local and Asian brands.
Bass lover here. But gets too bassy,3.0,"Issues.Cinnectivity.---------------The Bluetooth connectivity is not at all good. Just breaks some times. Not at all recommended for gym workout( atleast not for cardio.) Stopped working many times when I had a good amount of sweat.Sound.I am a bass lover and always a budget guy. Till now used different kinds of in ear earphones. Senhizer cx 180.. jbl . Panasonic, boat, etc.. all in same range approx. But i still prefer senihizer cx 180 over boat 225.  Boat just has too much of base the voice mainly feels submerged. I had to turn off all the equalizers ( music app and mobile ) so that I could get a better voice..however it feels too bass. Atleast not while listening to music but it feels while watch a movie speciallly Hollywood.Disappointed a bit.. satisfiesld a bit.. but majorly disappointed"
Worst headset - Do not buy it and there is no warranty center too,1.0,"I have researched a lot before investing in bluetooth headset. Within two weeks, left side of headset doesn't seems to work. Amazon is now saying that return policy already got over and there is no service center in chennnai. During the covind19 situation, i'm fed up with the customer service from amazon as well from boat now.When service center are not there do not mention it as one year warranty rather update as use and throw. Guy i'm music lover, thought boat would satisfy me during the pandemic but actual pandemic is far better than boat service center and customer support. I'm writing this review to make you all aware about this issue."
Too Bassy! Mudding down all tones. Even Bass lacks thumping.,3.0,"Cons: 1. Too Bassy! Mudding all tones.  2. Unable to listen all instruments getting  played due to heavy bass.  3. Even Bass is not best which lacks clear  thump.  4. BT connection always requires line of  sight. Poor reception within rooms.  5. Battery life average.Pros:1. Noise cancellation is great.2. Bulit quality is good although plastic.3. Call quality seems fine. No complaint received from far end so far. However, Bass comes to picture even for voice.4. Bass centric. But don't expect much from bass also."
Waste of money....go for something else.,1.0,Sound quality is fine..........bass is super strong......connectivity is poorest of all the wireless earphones or headphones i have ever used .......everytime when i opens my phone while music is playing there is a lost of connection and the sound quality also degrads and also music lags a lot.......whenever battery goes below 20 % it notifies you with it's irritating high pitch sound......doesn't connect properly with my laptop.....you can't change songs from it's buttons.....i am using this from past 2 months all the problems are happening from the very first day.
Hiccups are there .,3.0,"There is hiccup in the audio even when there is no other bluetooth devices around. When there is a bluetooth device turned on nearby, frequent hiccups are assured. Keep this in mind while making a purchase."
Value for money ¬• must buy,4.0,"great in most aspects( only for music lovers )bass-9/10bass is ultimate if u r a bass lover than it's for u.PUBG player note:-not recommended for playing games for it has sound lag, which most of this budget earphones give.If want ear or headphones for gaming than this is not for u.sound quality-8/10noise cancellation 7/10the main part of noise cancellation is that it could cancel most noise like people's voice,traffic etc. but not useful against sharp noises i.e. sound of all same frequency .bluetooth connectivity-5/10very poor u an even go even 8m away but description shows 10m.overall 7.25/10BUT still great in budgetgot this for 999/- in GIF"
Left side ear bud speaker not working within 2months time.,1.0,"I purchased this on 29..9.2021, within 2 months of scarce usage the left side ear bud speaker is not in working condition.I purchased this for my wife.Although I purchased boat rockers neck back about more than a year the band is still in good working condition. Hope M/s Boat Rockers will either replace this two'month old one or consider servicing it at their authorised service centre at ERNAKULAM."
Super osm product + beast battery üîãüî•üî•,5.0,"This is super osm product by boat in this price range. When I receive it from Amazon it's battery was 100% and then I used it for 7 hrs @50% volume after that when I checked battery percentage it was 99%. And if you are base lover plaese try it once.But one thing I not liked is its build design, extra  controller makes its design weird and if you use it for 2-3 hrs you feel pain on right side because of controller."
"Not a consistent one, worst warranty service",1.0,"Bought 3 and giving review after 5 months. Sound quality. Battery backup is really good. But the product quality is not at all good. And the worst part is that during warranty period, service by them. Worst service. It takes more than a month for a replacement to get. So what will happen is that 6 months it will be with you and 6 months with them. It is cheap, but you will start regretting it, when first time, it stops working, then waiting period will start and will never end"
"4Stars only for the battery, but not satisfied for calling, Hopeless Mic",4.0,"If you want to listen to music, podcasts, audiobooks, go for it, but if you want to attend calls? then I won't recommend this earphone, because the other person can hear a little hissing sound, I didn't like the microphone quality, but the rest is just ok. Battery is really good."
Poor customer care,4.0,Its been over a few weeks trying to reach Boat customer care to fix an issue with the bluetooth headset. Stopped charging one fine day and no response on mail or call center number. Do they expect customers to assume the product is due for replacement once it stops working??
Worst product and much worse service by the manufacturer,1.0,"It stopped working within a month. then I contacted for warranty. It is now 4 months since I have returned it and haven't received yet.When I filed a complaint with consumer forum, then these people created a ticket for dispatching the product. It is now a week since that ticket was created and not yet received the product.The service phone number does not work. It take nearly 50 attempts to talk to their support team.Pathetic product, pathetic service and pathetic system of warranty."
"Go for something else , Spend money more get a good one.",3.0,"After using of 1 months :1. Bass is awesome.2. Battery is also good.3. The design is good but the wire is bit lengthy. It feel a little out of the neck.4. The buttons on it are horrible. Sound buttons are good but the middle can do nothing useful. It will pick up the call but u can't disconnect it from there. Also no music forwarding after two click instead it redial the last dialled no. Shitty Configuration.5. Also after a long use , i usually get a bit of headache. Its quite often. So , i use it only when i need to other times, i had to off it."
Outstanding sound quality. Best buy!,3.0,"I have been using this since 3 days. Liked it, but price (1500) is a bit more. Overall its a good buy. Sound quality is great.Reviewing after 12 days of use:Don't believe in charging time of 6 hours as they said. I am literally getting not more than 3hrs. Hence, reduced my rating from 4 to 3."
Rockerz...Truely Rocks..Thumps Up,4.0,"Boat Rockerz..1. Noice cancellation 4/52. Bluetooth Connectivity 4/53. Battery Backup 5/54. Call Connectivity 4/5And most important one5. Music/Songs clarity..4/5..If you install Bass Booster App and do the settings as done by me then you will get surprised by the sound output.Hence I advice to those whose main purpose of buying this earphone is to listen music, to install Bass Booster App with the equalizer settings and do the settings according to your needs which will improve sound output to the great extent..ThanksBut that app only supports some of the music players..thankfully Google play is supported by the app.."
Frequent noise coming after few days of use .,3.0,"Used for 3weeks now , good sound quality for few days . After that some noises began occasionally, thought it was some glitch at that time . But now it's frequently occuring , since my Return window closed , i can't able to return the product. got stuck now . Never experienced Boat product like this . Worst buy for me ."
Returned the product once and the replaced one also had issues within 7 days.,1.0,"I did not expect the replaced earphone for the second time also to create problems within 7 days.The voice while talking to other person was breaking and sometimes not even audible and same while listening to the downloaded songs the voice goes away for few secs and then continues playing. This was irritating. Now it will not even connect to my phone tried with 2 3 mobile phones after unpairing and pairing n no. of times, still it won't recognize.Very disappointed, i don't know if the problem is with the supplier Appario Retail Private Ltd or boat itself.Won't recommend this to anyone."
Honest review after 2 month continuously using,5.0,it has  extreme bass and a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity. It has a mindblowing battery which gives 7-8 hrs music playback time . It's mic is also good & you will not be  disappointed with the voice quality. But more than putting 2 hrs it feels very uncomfortable to me bcz of its conical buds(can be removed). It's Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in looking.It's long wires really disappointed me. Its packaging is bad.Otherwise it is a very good headphone in this price segment.  I really liked it.
Excellent Product,5.0,"Exactly as per description.  Super product.  Pods fit snugly into the ear and the guide to the inside of the ear for stability.  Will remain secure with head movement associated with physical activity.  Cord lengths are good enough for big head sizes also.  Feature of magnetic connect of the two sides when not being used ensures that the accessory will not fall off when hung around the neck and not being used.  Very good sound quality.  Noise cancellation is excellent too as even when the pods are in the ear, you can barely hear the person opposite to you talking in their normal voice."
Awesome piece with minor probs,4.0,"This is a great neckband... Noise always makes awesome products... I bought this neckband and the bass, sound quality, noise cancellation is very good...But it has 2 cons:1) The mic quality is not very good... The other person said my voice to be very cripsy and sometimes distorting2) The magnetic powe of the neckband is not strong...BTW I will definitely suggest someone to buy these neckband..."
Average But bulid quality is more improve it,3.0,Background noise is riseing while Bluetooth is on timeAnd second think is not comfortable for this specific typeAnd change better type to flug moreEar is pain most of use this typeBass is okWire is not fluxable so improve the bulid Metrial
Not upto the mark,3.0,Sound quality is ok okNo noise cancellation it's only written material but in reality its not thereBass is ok in low volume but not for high volume listeningBluetooth range is as per product 10 meters but if you go 1 foot away from your phone or other device voice cracks or unable to hear sound or music
Worth it?!,2.0,So this Bluetooth earphone is widely bought by people because of course it fits the good budget range . And to be fair its not a bad choice altogether.But come 2/3+months and it shows the real worth .Connection drop no sound cancellation.  Abruptly hetting disconnected and the list goes endless. There's no workaround for any of these its like absolute frustrating when you are in dire need of it and it will just not connect or drop .
For bass lovers,4.0,"The sound quality is crisp and a good amount of bass, in terms of comfort this comes with a metal head which will cause u pain after 2-3hours but the neckband is weightless , you will get a good noise cancellation only when the volume is above 70%, the battery backup as claimed gives a 6hrs which enough for two days, when it comes to design the wire is too long which makes a awkward look, there was no Connectivity problem if you find so please check the transmitting deviceOverall a good bluetooth earphonesBuy this only during sale days"
Good quality Bluetooth earphones,5.0,"I am writing this review after using the earphones for 3 months. I bought this earphone only after my uncle confirmed me about its quality. The sound quality is excellent feels as if you are in a movie theatre, the charge lasts for quite a long time. I use it daily and charge once in two days for 30-45minutes only. But the only problem is during a phone call when the voice breaks a lot and we have to switch to wired earphones. The Bluetooth range is appreciable."
Not expected this from Boat,3.0,Its good to hear music I will give it 7/10 but it keeps disconnecting once in a while I use this around 8-10 hours not continuously but taking break in between and it disconnects around 4-5 times and sometimes when I call someone I and connected to Bluetooth I can't hear someone's voice untill I disconnect and reconnect and sometimes when I receive calls while playing battle royale game and then get back to game the sound comes from speakers instead of bluetooth
Utterly Poor range and no auto-connectivity,3.0,"After two months review.1) Poor Bluetooth Range: It often gets disconnected due to poor range, you even can't go to your balcony/kitchen.2) No auto connectivity and smooth Multi-connectivity: No auto-connectivity when you come back in its short range and you have to switch it on first if you hadn't connected another device with it and, if you had then you have to struggle to connect your device.3) Good bass, noice cancellation and sound quality.Earlier, I was using Boult Probass Audio, it didn't have connectivity issue though but, noise cancellation & audio quality were very poor. I bought this because of the foreign brand but, it has its own different problems.Seems like there is no bluetooth earphone within Rs1500."
Best,5.0,I was second customer  who bought this neckband and I must tell you one thing that the Quality of sound and 40 hours long battery life is what makes it different from Others. This is my 5th purchase of boat product. only con I find was YouTube getting pused and both audio on YouTube and call are not possible.
Overall gud need improvement Specially while connecting,4.0,"I got shipment on time through Amazon. I hv been using this since frm 10 months. I feels gud sound quality, gud bass quality. Bt it lack in noise cancellation. On call other person can clearly hear others long surrounding noise.Plus in starting its battery backup was upto 5hr. Bt now it reduces day by day. So i hv to charge more.Also it created problem while connecting with my laptop. Every time i hv to do switch on and off regularly so that i can connect properly, sound lag occurs which is very high negative point for me."
Really good,4.0,"Exceptional product at its price! Battery is a monster. Lasts all week with mild usage. Charging and Noise cancellation is also very good.What could have been better - Placement of component that houses buttons and mic.Also if it had auto off function after magnetic sides of ear buds connect, then it would have been best w/o a doubt."
Good for general perpose,4.0,"Good if you are in <‚Çπ1500.. sound wuality is not superb but it cant be registered as bad. Is good but not matchable with jbl. Higher frequencies are missing and baas is not enough powerful. Actually it is serving my requirements completely as off watching movies and series. For enthuastic music listeners, this is not recommended but for routine use its is good. Battery life is for whole day with normal calls and 6-8 hour movies. Product looks sturdy and durable. Connects automatically when paired with a device earlier, sometime you have to manipulate in your ear for fitting, ear bud looks cheap though, extra 2 set of earbud are available in the box along with small usb cable"
Not a good choice,2.0,"Bass us good, but very poor noise cancellation. Bulky buds causing pain in ears after sometime. Battery life is not good.Compared it with boult which comes at same price. Sound quality and bass is good compared to it but  It is heavier than Boult. You will keep feeling something bulky object fitted in the ear."
Good product but bit expensive,4.0,"Battery life is good but not that great, expecting bit more for this price.Sound quality nicely clear, loud and no distortion at moderate volume.Durability is good but product looks somewhat delicate so I am not sure it can handle some rough usage.Wearing comfort is good, connecting process with phone is very easy and fast."
"Don't duy, 6 month headphone.",1.0,"Dont buy this. It will work only for 6 months. After 6 months it will stops charging/ one side speaker will not work. You have to go for replacement, replavement product also will work for 6 months. I have same issues with 3 of my headphones."
It is a below average product,2.0,The sound quality is not good. Also it is not very user friendly when it comes to usability. The quality of material is also substandard. It looks like very cheap quality plastic and rubber used.
Best Bass and pure sound.,5.0,"This bluetooth earphone is awesome. Bass is very good, I love to watch bollywood and hollywood action movies with this earphone.Truely very nice product on very low price. Battery backup is decent."
Disappointed üôà by BOAT,2.0,"The output is ok but not that it could have been .There is a problem with clarity as the apple wire earphones have a much better output and clarity then these boat rockers 255.O bought it in on sept 28, 2019 and today on 13th aug 2020 they have stopped workingSo the value for money is 1 star ‚≠ê out of 5 and rest is average max 2.5 star ‚≠ê or 3 star but could have been betterAnyways disappointed with boat I guess they hoax about there product a lot but it's not worth it.Will definately not advice you to go for this one.Might be cheap as compared to others but not good at all"
Poor bluetooth connectivity,2.0,"Positives1.medium bass2.good battery back up3.stylish...can able to hear even in bed(it wont hurt ur ears when u r lying by side)Negatives1.very poor bluetooth connectivity.if u keep ur fone in one room and if u walk away to another room with headset,then it will get disconnected..2.the wires are too long.so while walking it is little bit annoying by swinging.that too it touches the belly3.when the battery gets lower,a very annoying sound keeping on repeating(its irritating..my previous headset mivi thunderbeats wont do this)4.bad noise cancellation...it will clearly absorb all sounds at outer area.so while travelling in bike or in outdoor, opponents cant able to hear ur voice properly"
Go for it...,5.0,Bought it last week didn't charged it once still 40% charge left used it for almost near to 20 hoursAt this price range (1400) there's no other alternative for boat rockers 255pro+Sound quality - 4.5/5Bass - 4/5Battery -10/5 üòÇProduct quality - 4.3/5Connectivity - 5/5If you're looking for a Bluetooth earphone with good battery backup and above average sound quality at this range this is one for you
The product is bad and not usable.,1.0,"I bought the product on 6th May 2021.  Sorry to say that the product is not working properly.  Person on the other side is unable to hear my voice.  One of my friend bought the same product 3 days back and he is also having the same complaint.  The voice is not clear, speakers are not working properly, the mike is not clear.  Didn't expect such a product from boAt.  The product is not giving its basic value, functionwise.  Please look into the matter urgently."
Not good,1.0,"I have been using this product since 3 months. Initially it was working fine but now the bluetooth connection breaks automatically with the phone. Tried switching off and on several times, it's not working fine. Not recommended. Even I dont know where to complain since I dont find a service centre. Would request amazon to provide me assistance with boat rockers service centre"
Works only with in warranty time,3.0,"After using 11 months ,left side cable lose contact ,Got replacement ,After 10 months replaced ear-phone left side cable lose contact ,So it works only with in  warranty time,previously i have wired one ,it is also same problem, Sound quality was good"
Overall average product.,3.0,"The build quality is not upto the mark the wire quality is not so good, realme buds wireless and one plus buds are even better build and presence. The battery percentage is showing 100 even after 4 hours of use and then suddenly it directly drops 20 percent of battery no exact battery percentage shows with time."
Damm Awesome Earphones,5.0,This neckband is damm awesomeLook and colour is niceVery clear and loud soundBass boosted...if u r bass lover then definitely go for itOne of its best feature is Fast chargingFast bluetooth pairingNoise cancellation is also goodI like this neckband specially for crystal clear sound and high bassU should go for it üëçüëç
"Okay, need to improve..",4.0,"Need to improve: -*All of sudden it is showing battery down, 80% to 20%* The design of product need to improve, it is not exactly fitting in the ears..*Overall everything is good..Sound , quality, bass everything is good, I'm giving 5/3 ratting.."
Give some online help about to replacement/ return/ repair of the product.,1.0,"The product sound quality and bass quality is good but after 20 days it suddenly stops working. Now,  It is neither charging nor connected to my phone. I can't able to return/replace the product due to expiry of replacement period. It still have 1 year warranty but how can I change without visiting its workshop as there is no option for return/ replacement on online portal. My money is wasted for this product. So, I'm suggesting not to purchase boat products."
Worst noise cancellation,1.0,"The earphones sound quality is ok, but when used as headphones for calling purpose, the other person keeps on complaining about the sound quality. Checked the same and found noise cancellation of the earphones is very poor.Very disappointed with the product."
A generic toy with a brand label,3.0,"Just okay, not as advertised.Bass: 4/10Sound: 6/10Comfy level: 7/10I thought I‚Äôd get a deep pounding bass, but that was not the case. I thought the sound would be crisp and clear, well, it was up to some extent just as you would expect in a generic brand, but not even close to that of JBL‚Äôs.Bottom line: I regret the choice I made."
Good,5.0,"Excellent battery backup/charging is super FAST / Bass quality is good, I do not know if there is many of settings on this. easy to connect via Bluetooth.My usage is very high in terms of talking over the phone, I use FULL day with a maximum over the phone."
"""Nice product"" & "" Great service by boat""",5.0,Everything is just awesome except the noise cancellation microphone while talking on calls ....it catch surrounding noise more then person's voice................From here i write it after 1 year of use:- My product get damage after 11 month of use one side Earphone is not working. But nothing worrys me because it has 1 year replacement warranty so i registed complaint on boat website they provide me door to door replacement option however i have to wait for near 25 days and finally i get my new earphone.I am totally impressed with boat service so i definitely recommend boat product to you all .
Not Efficient,3.0,"Don't Buy this Product. Instead go for the Basic Boat rockerzz bluetooth.I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and I barely get about 5hrs after full charge. Also, in less than an hour the charge drops to 80% after full charge. But, 60% to 20% stays good between 2 to 3 hours.All the above stated issues are managed by quick charging tech. But, it annoys that the usage period after charging is not efficient!"
so so..,4.0,I have used boAt Rockerz 255 and others from boat and Jabra. Music sound quality is good. The call sound is less crispy but my problem is with the weight of the ear head (less comfortable).
Beware of policy.,4.0,"I purchased this bluetooth and after even 20 days i found trouble to connect, there was little bit trouble in button, i requested to change the product and it took about 10 -15 to resolve my problem,  But plz make sure about the exchange and trouble policy, this headphone can be delivered anywhere but BOAT gives only well known places in its options to exchange or return, so plz be careful."
"Its a good product, but...",4.0,"I received the product as shown. It was packed real nice. I've been using the product now for past 6 months. The bass is really good. From this product, you can expect a good quality of sound. However the issue lies with the microphone. Many times I have heard from callers that they can hear everything else but my voice. Overall its a good product, but I am a bit disappointed with the microphone."
Go for boat headphone 450 pro,3.0,"Sound quality is average, almost equivalent to normal 400 wired earphones.Noise cancellation - nothing appreciableBass quality - I was really amazed to see such a poor quality of bass in boat earphone. Have used several boat earphones(wired, Bluetooth headphone) but this one is really disappointing. Not sure if this is the problem with every neckband or I have set my threshold far high coz of headphone."
Not worth the price,1.0,"I was using Realme wireless, that are about 1500 rupees as of now and I bought it for a family member. Compairing both, I'll say the sound quality is miserable in this, It takes only half the time to get from 100% to 20% and takes 3-4x time to charge to 100%.I have also used wired boat earphones (about 600 rupees) and the quality was much better than this.I would suggest either invest a bit more to get a better product or get a cheaper wired one."
Great Headphones,5.0,"I liked the headphones sound and quality. Bass is also good voice is clear too. But I really felt discomfort while using it, reason is that when its plugged in ear it feels like a vacuum suction inside the ear. otherwise its good. Charging time 2hrs and usage time 4-5hrs playing song."
Perfect  review  writing  in 2 months  after.,5.0,"Very high quality  product from Boat.  also boat bass head 225 is best in quality.  It's best Bluetooth  earphone and it's my Second  boat earphone and I satisfied with Boat rokerz 255 . It's feature 2 device  pair is work perfectly.  So Nyc Boat.  I also use data cable, car charger"
Worst product I have seen ever and not suitable for gym purpose,1.0,1) Sound QualitySound quality is very bad their no bass it looks like a copy product of boat Samsungs wired handsfree are much batter than this handfrees.2) Not suitable for gyming purposes the handfree is only good when you are sitting at one place and using handfree.If you are not stable ate one place hanfree will come out from ears again and again.3) worst customer support from Amazon they are making customers fool by giving 10 days return policy after purchasing the product you can not replace or return your product they only show that you can return your product under 10 days but actually you can not.
Good sound and battery.,5.0,Amazing product from boat.Really loved it.Pure Bass experience.Great sound.6 hours of Playback time on full charge at 100% sound.And 8-9 hours of playback time on full charge at 60 % sound.Boat always good.Thanks amazon for delivering such a nice product.
Complete waste of money on these bluetooth earphones..go for wired,2.0,One of earphones not working within two months of use. Sound quality is very poor. Mic is not too good either but better than my PRIMIU APOLLO earphone which I bought later and is completely useless. In fact both Apollo & Boat blutooth earphones are useless.I am going to throw both earphones in a dustbin and share a video later.I will try normal wired earphones from now on.
Good pair of Bluetooth earphone however not useful for RUNNING. And cannot be Stored in any case.,4.0,"Disclaimer: This is big detailed review.Bluetooth Earphones are of good quality. Sweat and water-resistant. Charging time is ~40 minutes. Works for 4-5 hours use straight. And can be on standby mode for 6-8 hours. Hence overall covers 10-14 hours usage initially if you are migrating from good pain of wired earphone like jbl cs100si or scheniser CX180 you will feel its sound somewhat different with extra base. However, you can control sound profile using installing Equilizer app from play store.However, one thing is important this is not that much suitable for runners. When I start running with them its neckband and battery unit starts oscillating over my neck. Earbuds remain fix on ears due to the extensions provided with it however this neckband and battery units are not at all that much stable.So if you are planning to use these for day to day use then this is great Bluetooth earphone. But if you are trying to pair them while running then this is not at all a suitable match.In addition, the design is such that after wearing them around neck cables creates a sharp bend near the battery unit which is a matter of concern and can cause Bluetooth Earphones to go bad in short time.I almost forgot about keys provided on the neckband. These are great, tactile and highly responsive. Google Assistant also works flawlessly with the help of them. Range wise if you are in the same room around 10-12 feets distant from mobile then these earphones works best. After that, if you increase distance further or change room and go to the next room some glitches in sound occurs.I almost forgot about one thing the storage for these earphones. It is very difficult to store them in any container or box as compared to any other wired earphone which you can wrap and place in any box or pouch. Hence as you cannot wound it you have to always wear them on the neck. No other option, you cannot just slip them in the last pocket of your backpack as this can cause harms to cables. This is almost annoying for me every time."
To claim warranty,1.0,"I want to claim warranty....I ve issue on my wireless bluetooth headset,It was not working on right side from last night"
Best for the price of under 1300/-,4.0,"First of all, for 999 it's the best.So I'm reviewing this as a 13-1500 rs device.After 3 months of usage-Soung quality is very good for the price.Bass is also very good.Range is 'decent'.You'll become used to in 2-3 days of usage it's comfortable (it's light as )Connectivity and usability is also very easy.Mic will work well most of the time, just ensure it's at the right place.But one thing I'd say you after 3 months of usage that build quality us 'above average' that's all, especially you have to be very careful with the wires."
Product is good but not reliable and warranty procedure is just pathetic,1.0,"Product is good but very disappointed with warranty. The product started disturbing within 2 month, then after 4 month one side stopped working. I complained and they started the process of replacement and it takes like 35 days to get the replacement product. I returned the product with box and all accessories but they only gave me the product no box or accessories were there, and product color is also different which I added in this review. So overall er pathetic experience with warranty"
Volume too low in music and in call,1.0,"I was so excited when I purchased this Bluetooth headset. But too much dissapointed when I used. Volume is very low while listening, not up to mark and no bass at all in any song. Totally dissapointed, returned back. Not recommend for music lovers at all. Even in call , caller volume is also very low."
Great great product.. simply the best,5.0,"Best headphones I have ever bought and I have tested quite a lot of them from a lot different brands n price range.. this one simply knocks all of them out of the field in terms of sound quality, bass, loudness and battery life.. Go for it without any hesitation and you won't regret your decision!And ya they stay in your ear n create a sound isolation too... Good for running too!"
Just okey but not great,3.0,- manually switch off and on control.- cheap quality magnet does not hold the drivers. No use of a magnet.- driver looks cheap.- no magnet control to stop pause disconnect.Positive: Flat cable
Good value for the price.,4.0,"Bass is high, ideal for hip hop music, but if u r into instrumentals and sad slow songs you'll feel it a nuisance and noise. Connectivity was good with my OnePlus 5, built quality looks long lasting, light weight but the wire is too long, beats the whole idea of a wireless headset."
Pathetic customer care service!,1.0,First of all..i am really disappointed with boat's customer care service..i purchased them on 17th november and on..25th of december the charging port was not working at all...i registered a complaint on the very same day..the product was replaced with an already damaged product...the voice quality was not good while calling...additional voices were heard on call on the other side...What kind of customer care service is this??It was such a waste of money..Will never ever purchase any boat product again in futurenor will recommend anyone to purchase it..I have registered a complaint again...eagerly looking forward to boat'service...thankyou..!!
Not a long lasting product,2.0,When we Purchased it in April'2019. Used it for Two months now.....initially the bluetooth convenience in connecting two phone and sound quality made us happy......... but just in two months the volume has become very low... the sound quality has deteriorated ..... so we are  not satisfied . will not suggest anyone else to go for this product.
Mostly ‚õµ will stop working in 4-6months,1.0,"Product is good but it will stop working within 4-6 months and even you have the 1 year warranty but the support team is the worst for this boat company, so I suggest not to buy boat products"
Great buy,5.0,I have been using this for a year. Great sound quality and audio clarity.  Worth the price compared to the competition.Bought it for 999.The mic is not perfect and you can expect a poor mic response when battery goes low.
Worst product don't buy,1.0,I was using from the past 2 months with my experience i am going to share you.Quality: very very badNoise Cancellation utter flop(plz this is the main issue). When i am talking to my friends using this headset they are irritating to getting a such noise from my side. They have mentioned noise cancellation but that not working.Bass:  Bass quality also is very Bad.plz avoid to buy this product.
"No extra bass, not worth more than Rs.600-700",3.0,"I bought this product for Rs.1500 but it was not worth it. It is a normal earphone with normal sound quality, i wouldn't say that the quality is bad, but the price is too high for the quality. The product says super deep bass but the bass quality is especially very poor. There isn't any extra bass. The band is super flexible, which is a good thing, but the product is much cheaper looking than seen in the pictures. There are no special lights except for a very tiny, almost invisible blue light . Overall I would be happy to buy this for Rs.600-700 but not more than that."
Bluetooth not working properly.worst product comes with damage box.unseald box.worst sound quality..,3.0,"First of all please don't highlight my review or any comment for this product , bcze I have been a regular customer of Amazon since 2012-13 , at that time I ordered books for my study , and this account belongs to my sister account ARCHANA KUMARI (elder-housewife) , if you want to contact me through my account please go through my account details BIMLESH PRASAD -7277950100 with registered email id -bimlesh111@gmail.com....2nd thing - I got my headphone ( boat rokerzz) which I have ordered and I got earlier as expected &  was NOT totally sealed , but I ignored at that time, because I have to check my product.The product was fine good while opening and tested further , rest I charged Bluetooth headphone for about 2 hrs...and then now I am listening and answering calls from my friends....My doubt and review about product is that ....Bluetooth is not working properly while listening song and walking ...it gets disconnected and mobile phone ( REDMI NOTE 4) is in mypocket .Kindly give me suggestion and review from your side what should I do....??? I have invested my money after deep review and suggestion from friends , relatives and family.For further information - kindly contact me -7277950100(Bimlesh PRASAD)bimlesh111@gmail.com"
Lasted only 45 days!!,1.0,No problem with design and noise cancellation but it lasted only for 45 days. The right side is stopped working. I have observed that boat product don't last long even though there quality of sound is good. It's a complete loss for me. I should have buy jbl.
"Connectivity Problems while in Pockets, Everything's seems good but this is very important.",1.0,"Whats the use of wireless earphone when there is a connectivity issue when i put my Phone in pockets the music disturbs(sounds begins to stuck), thats irritating. Never expected from BOAT. I have used 3 wired earphones of this BRAND which sounds good. The music quality is awesome. I purchased this as to use while working out, jogging, listening music while travelling, whats the use of wireless headphone when you have to keep it in the upper pocket always. I don t know i have got a defective piece. I have ordered the replacement of the same. Will review further if this issue is solved. If unsolved than no point of buying this earphones. In the box its given for 10m but shocked to see  its gets fluctuated even at less than meter. And of the obstacles walls we can understand, I means putting in jeans and travelling is so much common. @ boat please do reply if you read ."
Everything is great except the connection issues.,1.0,"The sound quality, base everything is top notch. But the main issue is it's connection. Sometimes even when the Bluetooth is connected, no voice comes in the earphones. And then you have to disconnect and connect again. Also, it rarely supports connection with two devices at the same time. Despite being connected, only sound is received from one of them. And one of them remains on mute even when the other device is not using sound."
VFM product,4.0,Pros:1. Impressive bluetooth range even with physical blockers in between2. Sound quality is satisfactory3. No issue with sweat4. Fits well in earCons:1. Poor battery life. You need to charge every 2-3 days even with just 1 hour of usage. Long charging duration2. Connecting wires a bit longer thus look odd while wearing them in gym
First positive then negative,4.0,"First thing the audio quality is too good in this price range, 2nd is built quality strong and smooth finish, 3rd is easy to connect to devicesNegative point is the speaker head is over Wight, so its not comfortable in ears, even tried with small buds but it won't fit and it's not flexible so I can't put it in my pant pocketsBut over all the performance and quality is worth for the money"
Good . But not best,4.0,Everything is fine with this product. Sound is very clean .. Bass is good . Only issue is its  battery life. It gives me mostly 4 hrs on continuous play. Almost in this product range .. you can find oneplus bluetooth earphones and real me earphones where battery life gives you around 12 hrs .I have only battery life issue with this product
Seriously Disappointed,1.0,"I am one those people who love listening to high bass songs all the time.So i decided to buy boAt headphones for their so called superior bass and trust me y'all, j was seriously disappointed. The sound quality is no doubt quite good the the bass had me seriously wanna cry for waste of money(yeah I am a student and saved months for them).....Even my previous 500rs Mi wired earphones had better bass..Damn you boAt......1 star due to high expectations faced by low reality"
"Sound, Built quality was great however Bluetooth connectivity issues",4.0,Sound & build quality was great. Buttons are well placed and bigger for convenient operations. Bluetooth get disconnected if kept mobile in pant pocket which is irritating while jogging. Needs to resolve this problem as in 2 to 3 feet distance Bluetooth getting disconnected.
Fake Aptx codec branding,1.0,Sound is very loud but Aptx codec is not supported by the neckband ..it is limited to AAC codec only ..false claims by the company.
Worst Built Quality | Poor return response,1.0,"The worst quality earphones i have ever used. I replaced a defective first one, got a more defective second one. The ear piece is seperated from the hub. I think this is the most common defect and because of worst built quality. My return request is just ignored by Amazon. No one came to pick up the item and it was showing ""refund would be initiated after successful return of item"". So no pick up by them, no refund. Very disappointed for the first time with Amazon. I feel Amazon is best and rely on their products and return policies. But it's not a smooth experience for me."
Disappointment,2.0,"Well these aren't nearly as nice as it thought they would be using since a week, firstly they aren't even comfortable to wear and even after attaching them to the ear they get loose quite quickly and like I mentioned not comfortable another highly annoying part about this is that once you reach 20% battery you might as well assume it's zero because every 5 seconds you get a prompt, ""oops battery low"" and well the sound quality the bass and the 'noise cancelation' barely noticeable quite underwhelming sound and bass cheaper headphones have better."
Worst product ever,5.0,Quality is up to the mark as expected from boat.Sound quality is good.Noise cancellation is also good.Bass is not as good as expected.22th Jan'20Product is not working any more.And there is no replacement or any service provided from the boat.Service center is saying no for replacement.Please don't buy from this worst company
A battery that runs 2-3 days.... What else we need?,5.0,"I'm really happy with the purchase of Boat Rockerz 255 Pro+. Both the sound quality and noise canceling is very good. It fits in my ears perfectly. The best part is it's battery back up. I use it for work from home purpose, 8 hours consistently and the battery just drops by 20%. I was hesitant to buy Bluetooth earphones as I didn't want to charge them every other day or every other few hours but this item solves my issue. Kudos!!!"
Waste of money...Genuinely requesting go for something better..,2.0,"Rating-(Amazing>Nice>Okay>Bad>Worst) CONS-1- Terrible Treble..worst quality2- Bass not even okay...bad quality3- doesn't show accurate battery  percentage..Bad4- If you bought it accidentally then,  goodbye.. you can't get refund..  (my Biggest problem rn) Worst. PROS-1- Battery life is Amazing... using  since 3-4 days, still battery in  between (50-60%)"
Good performance at this price,5.0,hi the sound quality is very good and not truly impressive at this price. The passive noise cancellation has almost no effect since the cushioning of ear plugs into ear would almost suppress all the noise. There are extra earplugs at variable sizes given to us. And other than this there is no other accessories provided.
Not very durable,2.0,The product was okay for 3 months before the Bluetooth stopped working properly. It would get disconnected automatically. Sent the product for replacement but bOAT customer care doesn't answer calls or emails. It has been a month now and I haven't heard from them despite repeated calls and mails. The product is not very durable and you can't count on the warranty.
"Average, I am not interested",1.0,Not good as I thought. Writing this review after using 3months. Noise cancellation is not good. I purchased two headset of boat rockers 255. One of those set partially stopped working. Called amazon customer service. Waiting for replacement.
Not really worth it,2.0,"I used it for 2 days and I'm not really happy with this product. I purchased this to find something good in budget but it came out to be total waste. Guys if you are looking for something good in wireless, try to increase your budget a little bit higher. You will definitely find something good.The mic is the worst. I'd give it a 1/5. There is zero noise cancellation. The person hearing your voice can barely tolerate it. Do not get this product if you are gonna use it for calling as well. You even have to use voice chat at the time of gaming and it gets really annoying for them.The feel of product is decent. But the wire is incredibly long, feels weird while wearing it.I have attached images, i have used an A4 sheet for size reference.You can't wear it for longer time. The earpiece is huge and bulky. If you wear it more than an hour, it starts paining. It's not really comfortable plus it's made up of metal, it is a bit heavy.It looses connection often or you hear distortion/breakage of sound when you are traveling. You have to keep your device very close to you otherwise the sounds start breaking. You can't even use it across the room.It doesn't really have a good bass, the bass is okayish; 3/5. You can play around with equalizer to get a slight bass, other than that, it doesn't really have any bass considering it has 10mm drivers and that ""super extra bass"".The battery was fine until it reached 50-60%. The rest drained within 10 minutes of usage. It charges quickly though.I recieved a small charging cable and 2 pairs of earbuds (image)The packaging was average. It didn't damage the product but the cover was dented a bit, it could have been better with some protection.Sound: 3/5Noice cancellation (sound): 4/5Bass: 2.5/5Comfort: 2/5Mic: 1/5Noice cancellation (mic): 1/5Product feel: 4/5Delivery: 4/5Feel free to ask quarries"
very convenient,5.0,"I am a working woman and I hardly have time to make calls except when I am doing mundane things like cooking, gardening , cleaning, when I often make calls , but its not possible to carry my mobile everywhere I go. Most of the me the time, the phone falls from my pocket or hand and screen breaks. so this earphone is very easy to use while working, when you don't have to carry your phone with you and you can also speak while the phone is being charged."
It just add life to music .,5.0,"I am Deepti.  M giving this feedback almost after using it for 3_4 months.  Every day I start my day with some music with this earphone on my head.  This is so amazing . sound quality is outstanding.  Perfect noise cancellation.  I can feel each beat perfectly. Simply wanna say it's perfect, best for this price range.  Just adds life to any music."
Faulty Item Delivered 2 times,1.0,"Voice was breaking when I used earphone during Jogging. I guess it was having problem with Bluetooth connectivity .If I keep phone near to earphone it was working fine, but during walk or jog if phone is in pocket, voice use to break a lot. So I decided to replace it, but second time as well they delivered earphone with damaged earbud.It was frustrating. I am not buying it again.Over all Sound quality is good"
"Sound is not boat signature , But thumbs up to battery its last long",3.0,Overall earphone is okay ! Just one request boat to include silicon or fabric pouch to keep it clean ans secure.Sound is kind of sliced compressed but build quality and battery is too good.Thanx amazon for one day delivery
Worst earphone of my life,1.0,"Review after 4 months of usage.Life of this product is of 3-4 months,its not durable or reliable.One side becomes non-functional.The after service is the worst from Boat.There is no service center and there is no one to respond on callsYou may log a ticket with boat but there won't be any resolution for a month and no one will respond to your query.If you don't get frustrated with above things and are ready to pay more than 1000 bucks for this.. then God Bless U"
Excellent Product,5.0,"I am completely satisfied with is quality of sound, fit & finish.Earbuds are soft, hold in place with soft hook, doesn't come out while running. Base quality & clarity in sound is superb. soft plastic so no chance of tear or breakage.wires are sturdy, wide & flat.Navy blue colour is excellent. In this price tag this product is awsome."
Not lasting and 1 year warranty is useless as supplier is not reachable,3.0,"Its good for listening music or watching videos, but for calling purpose sound its JUST OKAY.Battery life is Okay not Good.I am using them from last 3 months and right side ear phone is not working.I tried to contact supplier for warranty claims but its not easy to contact him even AMAZON's customer support is not helpful. Number they have given is not going through.I paid around 1500/- and now they are not working properly :("
Economy class,4.0,Economic is what I would say. Not great nor too bad. It's decent with performance and battery life. You can surely go for it if u not a music freak and need sound quality of high standards. A really good product for day to day use. I would say for this price - the justice has been done.
warranty periods,1.0,I bought this item on 18th February 2019 from India but within 2 months it got damaged by not working right side earphone. Now i suggest you to not but this item as it is no trustable for me. And I do not know how to back it as I am in foreign right now
Stopped charging after 6 months!,1.0,Quality of the sound is good but my piece stopped charging in less than 6 month. Boat expects you to travel 30km to repair a sub 1000 product which obviously is a dampener. Have been a Boathead but this piece is just disappointing.
Do not buy this product.,1.0,Worst product. It gets connected to the device but we can't listen to anything. Tried to connect it with another device but same issue. It gets connected but we can't listen to anything that is played on the device or the ringtone or any other sound from the Device. Would suggest NOT to purchase this product.
received different size additional buds,2.0,"How can i consider these additional buds are of same size?is boat Rockerz india considering that we are human being of different type of ears?how can i put that first one bud of different size in one ear and another one of different size in another ear?these are the ear buds i got with my bluetooth headset. there is no doubt in the audio quality all is good, but you should take care of these things also. do this replacement asap.MIC is also not working."
Wires and circuit came off while detaching from charger; Low battery life,1.0,"The product is made of very cheap material, all the circuit and wires came off when I was taking the charger off from the device. I was shocked. The device is now a complete waste as the replacement or return period is over by few days. Also post charging the device does not give a good battery life. Other Bluetooth devices give way better battery life."
Best for money 1yr about rockers255,4.0,ProsGood for price wire quality great perfect fit best long term usage no issue i used it in heavy rain and while traveling and i used it hard to for 900 its best  bass is great audio quality goodCon call audio quality is poor Battery is less only 4.5 hrs in full sound With in 1 hour of continued use slight headpainbut its usually common for low budget headset
Value for money!! Good for bass lovers!,4.0,"Pros: 1.light weight, 2.fast pairing for BT, 3.Comfortable fit,4.Thundering bass!! Good for bass lovers.5.Google assistant works perfectly.Cons: 1.No vibration for call alert,hence can miss a call if phone is away.2. Due to extreme Bass, sometimes vocals and fine instrument sounds get masked.3. At full volumes, bass is very loud which if listened for long time can cause ear and headache.But there is a solution to the problem, you can install '' Black player'', which has tones of equaliser settings.So recommend people to use it and obviously go for boat rockerz 255, as it is value for money product!!! üòÉ"
Chinese product in Indian garb,1.0,"Had high hopes on this product since news articles had mentioned that boAt is an Indianbrand that is doing well. But only after buying, realised that this was also MADE IN CHINA.If I really wanted to buy a Chinese product, would have gone for brands like OnePlus.Sell genuine indian products, not Chinese products masqueraded as Indian."
Nice go for it.,4.0,"Review after  3 months of purchase;Bluetooth range is awesomeAnd the mic quality is quite good, it is good for calls, sometimes you can't even hear voices when on-calls , make sure that you're near to your device and you have better connection and try disconnecting and reconnecting. even if it doesn't work better throw them to garbageüòÇüòÇ (garbage list:it's useful for a programmer)Rich in bass. But the ear holding tip-makes you uncomfortable as you wear it for a long period of time. As I've removed Just because it was so annoying. And....Sounds great, sound quality is equal to Sony MdR-xb55AP-ExtraBass."
Be careful when you purchase during sale.,1.0,The worst product in the category. I don't know whether I rec'd defective product because both the head set that I purchased lacked clarity of voice and the reciever also gets lots of disturbance I had purchased one for my friend and one for self but both having the same problem now that the return period is also over I don't know how to resolve the issue....
"Conectivity dissapointing, design of earpeace flawed",3.0,"Overall:  Decent product, not worth the cost.Issues below are experience over 1 week of using the product on iPhone 6.Pros: Sturdy material, flexible behind the neck strap and wire quality durable and tangle free. Good battery life.Cons: The device does not have good Bluetooth connectivity. If your phone is more that one foot away from you, the sound gets cut off very often. For example, if you have your phone in your handbag/backpack/pocket, you can expect multiple cut offs, especially while moving (walking, using a scooter/motorcycle). If you move further away you need to be in direct sight of the phone for continuous music (if you turn your back to the phone or if there is any obstruction (not even a wall, a bathroom stall door is all it takes) the music gets cut off. Not sure if it is just my piece but this is very frustrating.The ear pieces have magnets so that it connects around your neck when not in use, however this makes each ear piece heavier, as a result if you are using smaller in-ear buds, they tend to fall out due to the weight of the ear piece. This becomes a hassle while working out, particularly jogging/running."
"Priced very high, Go for jbl wireless earphone for 2k",1.0,"Bluetooth connectivity is not as expected.Brought for 990rs and now it's for 2k that's way too much. People are not fool, if they have 2k budget then they'll go for jbl wireless earphone for 2000 rs instead.I believe review should be with respect to current price only which is 2k..."
Must buy,5.0,"Daily wear and tear, good product.. bought this the second time after the first wore out after 2 years.. money's worth"
"No doubt it has a great bass , just like it, thnks",5.0,No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.sound quality 10/10noise cancellation 10/10Bass quality 10/10Overall 10/10thanks
Worth the money,4.0,"Con(s) : The only con is it has an ugly design....yep ugly....when you are using the product it doesn't look good on you.Pros:1. The sound quality - I feel it's on par with few flagship earphones. Worth at this price range.2. Noise cancellation - to some extent does the job, due to to its bud design and due to the rubber tip.3. Bluetooth connectivity - am mostly near my phone, so that wasn't a problem for me. Few metres should be fine.4. Battery life - playtime got about 6 hours. Standby time is great - lasted many days for me.5. Portability - the whole texture is kinda rubberish, so you can fold it and keep it anywhere.6. Water resistant - got it wet on the rain once, worked fine.Thanks"
Great product,5.0,I'm writing this review after two months of using it. I'm so happy with the product let it be the sound quality or its noise cancellation. The battery is really good if you charge it fully you can go it for more than five hours of music n phone calls. Thanks Amazon.
Battery very good. Sound quality slightly low,5.0,"Battery backup was very very good while I am using lost 15days, but sound quality wasn't equal to JBL or infinity. But environmental noise cancelling good. In ear not fitted correctly. Oftenly ear piece was falling down. And travelers and long journey goers must have this 255 pro +.bcz it has very long battery backup.and  very good product this price range."
Good quality but bad noise cancellation,4.0,Quality is good and it stand for two days of continuous usage . But worst ergonomics it ill go through into ears if we push it slightly . Worst noice cancellation and call quality nd music quality also average . Considering price it a good product for daily usage
"Average sound quality,  ok for this price",3.0,Very average sound quality.. you can find average sound quality very easily with respect to details in music  .. built quality is good... fitting is below average.. fits only for usual ear size ... if you have smaller ears don't buy... but ok for this price range
Honest review of the product....!!,2.0,"It's been 5 days only that I have bought this product....Cons:-10m bluetooth connectivity is a myth, it only supports upto 3-5 m.-wires are not quite durable or thick.-Bass is lower than average.-not durable for long run-ears starts to pain after a use of 30min.Pros:-gets charged quickly.-light weight-gets connected quickly,no problem in connection.So, for me this product is lower than average.Now it's up to you,so think twice before buying thus product."
Don't buy it. It stops working in 6 to 10 months,3.0,This head phones is so good to useit has a 6 to 7 hrs of battery lifeThe music quality is good thoughAfter 9 monthsMy right ear bud stopped working now it is very uncomfortable to use with one head phones inThe mic is bad tooIn conclusion:Don't buy these headphones unless you have lot of money to spend for product like these. Don't Buy it
Wrong creatives mentioned,1.0,Website says its upto 8 hours playtime product says upto 6 hours. Box nowhere mentiones about ipx5 certification but website says it.Very low quality packing and cables.Dont expect much from this product
Worthless product,1.0,"No audio in left ear after 15 days of purchase, couldn't seek replacement. Now I have to run to service station for repairs. Buy only those boat products which have door step replacement service like 441 and others."
"Good sound ,outstanding battery life..",5.0,"I only wanted this for the battery and it delivered..i got them at 11am on Thursday 11 nov 2021 and after using it for almost 2.5 days playing bgmi and taking lectures it has 80% battery left ..will update the review after it dies completely.. updating this on 17nov 2021 Wednesday, battery is on 40% i think it will last for maybe 2 more days..will update when it dies.. battery finally died after 7 days of usage..on 18nov thusday night..total 7.5 days.."
I LOVED THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT WHICH IS WAY TOO COMFORTABLE.,5.0,I loved the colour variants. Sound quality is good but bass is a bit low compared to the wired ones. I have been using boult products now from last two years. I would like to say increase the bass quality and noise cancellation a little bitwhich then would make it the best in the market. Overall it is comfortable to wear and also adds up look into my outfit. I also would like to try the wireless which one of my friend recommended me. Thanks Boult for this great product and also do look into my suggestions your product would reach at its peak. Thanks
Awesome,5.0,Awesome battery backup.... You will love it. After using for about 3 weeks I have given the review. It's been 2 weeks I haven't charged the ear phone. And it's still not out of battery. It is running on and on. One thing to say that the sound clarity could have been better. But on the whole a very good set of earphones that are way better than the amount you are paying for. So can go for it blindly in the range of about 2000.
A very nice device in this budget...specially the battery backup,5.0,Very Nice product especially the battery back up I need for online class and work.Previously I was using the Boat Airpod 201. The battery back up was so low... But sound Quality was quite heathy. In this device I feel some difference...but the microphone works very well.Noise cancellation also works
Won't last more than 6 months.,3.0,I have been using this over 6 months now.No change is battery capacity it's still around 5-6 hur on continuous usage.At 900ma it's takes 40min to fully  change.I have already lost Charing pin cover.Some Times there is no audio.Charging cable stoped working in just 15 day's
Got it for discounted price 999 at the sale time!,4.0,"Got it for a good discounted price 999!Earphone looks good and the built quality too for the Boat price bracket.Sound is good, but not that high as wired boAt BassHeads 225!Feels not that great fit, as a neck band & need to check on Battery back up.Boat, Amazon & Appario Retail Private Ltd good job!"
"Just Awesome, love u boAt Rockerz",5.0,"I have been using boat headphones for 7 days. it is a excellent product from boat. crystal clear sound quality. noise cancellation is also good. on full volume u feel some noise so put ur volume 1 step down to full. build quality is awesome. Bass is just amazing, I'm using Redmi Note 9 pro Max sound is really very good with my phone. battery backup is also very good, it will take 1 to 1 & a half hour to fully charge and give approx. 6 to 7 hours continue playback time. Signal strength is very good. In this price range nothing is better then boAt Rockerz so go for it guys.. ‚ò∫"
Price dropped drastically,2.0,"When I ordered, I found its a moderate deal in 1049, but not experienced such bass or sound quality that a earphone should have nowadays in a price over 1000..Now its price drastically dropped down to 799, ofcourse it will be a good deal in this price, but mine was overpriced.."
Sound is good but battery kind of drains,4.0,"Looks cool, Sound quality is good, battery drains very fast but charges fast as well, the ear lobes not very comfortable for long use, bluetooth connectivity is quite fast, the voice the man that talks while connecting and disconnecting is very irritating, connects easily with phone while on calls as well and very clear too"
"Boat rockerz is Bluetooth 5.0,awesome product.",5.0,"There is no problem such a great product at this price range don't think in features they have written Bluetooth 4.0 it's actually 5.0Only one thing to say that don't worry buy with out any tensions it will really satisfy you the boat rockerz 255 is really awesome such a great production I am using for YouTube, online classes, music really it's water resistant,. One day when I am out it suddenly rained it even working well upto now it's almost a month I had used awesome product  Thank youAmazon."
Good product,4.0,This is the cheap and best product. I'm using this since last 7-8 months now. Bass is just perfect and noise cancellation works well. Battery lasts for a day for my kind of use. Even today the battery condition is good as new. The cons what I feel is 1. Buds and ear holders are not so good. They gets loose and fall. 2. The cap of charger is so delicate. It doesn't lasts longer.Pros:1. Sound is awesome.2. Wire quality is great.3. Battery is descent.
Great product,5.0,Really satisfied with this. Sound quality is good. The product is better than mivi .. especially the neck band n compact ear buds. Bluetooth connectivity is good and works recently well with two devices at once. Have my computer n mobile connected.
Bad product,1.0,I bought it less than 2 weeks back and it stops working even when the battery shows 70 percentage. This has been happening continually. It is not worth a purchase even with a warranty. Very bad product
"Don't Buy. All Show, but poor performance.",1.0,"The headphone looked awesome over the internet. It looks grey physically too... But it has the worst performance of any headphones that I have used. First of all, it does not connect properly to phones. It takes a lot of time to get discovered.Sound quality is ok, but when listening to music, clarity is not there at all. JBL or Skull candy is far far better than this. Even when connected, when I am receiving a call, it is making some robotic sound, hence the voice of the caller is not at all clear. Initially I thought it may be due to low charge or network congestion. But even with a full charge and strong network it does that.The mouthpiece is also of a very poor quality. People complain that they are unable to hear my voice, when in reality I am literally shouting at this end.Also the ear buds are uncomfortable.So all in all, please refrain yourself from buying this crap. Instead go for any other headphones."
Best for 1k,5.0,The bass is the best. I use a equalizer tho. The connectivity is average. Sometimes there ks tooo much latency but if you are a bass fan it will make it up for it.Very ergonomic. I had received a faulty piece but amazon replaced it as soon as i registered a complaint.Im satisfiedP.s dont spend more than 1.1k on this.
Maximum From It!!,5.0,"boAt Rockerz 255, while being lightweight in design pumps out your favorite tunes with powerful HD sound and deep boosted bass. The 10mm drivers installed ensure that you get an exceptional sound experience with articulate audio reproduction with a blend of pitch perfect frequency response. The sound produced by the boAt Rockerz 255 ensures that you differentiate music from noise and hear your favorite artists the way they were meant to be heard!"
Use and throw,3.0,"Noise cancellation is cognizable to some extent but the sound is not up to the mark along with the bass.i previously ordered boat pro base curve which I reckon was better than this piece in terms of sound and design, yet it was 100 bucks cheaper than this .Design wise it would definately be cumbersome to manage  due to its long chords on top of the entire neck band setup.Suggestions-no need to mention extra bass if that is not evident while listening."
Amazing,5.0,"Excellent sound quality and fits nicely in ears.Best among the blue tooth devices I have.Moreover, it hangs nicely in your neck and good for online jobs.Just go for it"
Average neckbend at high price,3.0,"I believed in boat .. and ordered it , battery backup is good but not showing exact percentage, bass and sound quality is average, hissing sound is irritating and it seems overpriced, now I think of replacing it with OnePlus for extra 500  but only replacement option is thereüòêüôÑ"
Comes with good durability and comfort,4.0,I bought this product as a gift for my best friend and she loved it very much. It is very comfy and light. And the sound quality was also pretty much good.Mainly if you are gamer i would suggest this. I'm a heavy pubg player and all pubg players are familiar with latency issues and when it comes to this one i would say when compared to others boat rockers 255 is better.
A good amount of patience needed,4.0,It pretty much stays in place unless you are exercising vigorously and not doing inverted postures.The charging port's user friendliness is questionable. Cumbersome but gets the job done.
Go For It without even thinking ...,5.0,Although I am Senhiser User But Got this recommendation from my friend Get this for 999 and What a master pice it iss Although Base Isss Quite High but love everything about this earphone Wires are nice magnet work perfectly And Battery is also Kind Of nice but not excellent But love at this price Point .Cant get better that that In wireless
Captures a lot of background noises,2.0,"Captures a lot of background noisesthe headphone captures a lot of your background noises that you don't even listen from your surroundings. When you're talking on call while using it, it doesn't give you that clear sound of the person but the background sound.Also, the microphone can't used from the distance, you have to be around the device you're connected to via Bluetooth."
Good quality but one problem,3.0,All in all. It is a good choice for Bluetooth earphone seekers. The sound quality is good and voice quality and bass are quite good. Connects easily. Doesn't take much time.Only one problem I found is it can't play two things at once. For example if you are on teams with a video call. And play some music in the background it will not give any sound even though it's playing. There is no option of choosing which sound to listen to. And the problem persists even if you mute one app completely
"very bad for calling,gaming and battery backup is around 2 hours",2.0,Sound quality is good for music only... battery :  working only for 2:00-2:30 hours maxMic: very bad everyone complaining that your voice is not coming proper.when you're doing video calling voice is not in sync..its come bit letter 1-2 seconds..and same thing happen when you sre playing game..PUBGüòÄüòÄ  . I am returning this.Product is not as per expectations...
Good quality,5.0,"Excellent....product. worth spending, I was looking for a Bluetooth headset for work...it's perfect for a noisy workplace...noise cancellation and call sound quality works well üëå"
Not valur for money and not at all for taking phone calls,3.0,"The mic is horrible. You can't use them for calling. The person on other end could hear the slightest background noise like the fan or an airplane passing by. The mics don't have noise cancellation.  It's pretty horrible that I had to return it.Without the calling function working fine it is not value for money. The sound quality is great if you want to use it just for listening to music. Battery life is decent, not the best available in the price range.Bluetooth connectivity is below average as I could hear glitches and breaks even if I keep my phone in the pocket."
Good buy,5.0,"So for the money you pay, this is ok. Easy to use and pair. Pairs to two devices at the same time. The only issue I have is with the battery indicator. Once it touches 40%, you can be sure that it's going to die anytime soon. I use it everyday and it's been running strong till date. One good feature is that it takes literally no time to charge from 0-100% which is very convenient."
Awesome battery backup,5.0,Delivered on 8th Oct...from than to now today 26th Oct. Total 18 days run without charging.Still 20% is remainingGreat job
Pain in ears,4.0,Initial use for more then 1 month was good anf battery backup is good also the sound quality is good...but if you want to use for long duration like 3 to 4 hours per day...then please think before buying..my ears are paining and I try to avoid using them now :(
Superb bass.superb sound quality ..crystal clear,5.0,I think this is the best in market.i got in 999 rs.so doesn't except many more ..but really awesome sound quality and base..mind blowing..just go for it ..thnq Amazon and thnq boat also..
One of the best neck band under 1000,5.0,So here is my review after 2 days....1.bass is good and boosted..2.sound quality is also nice..3.1 got these earphones with 100% charging...i used them for two hours for two days...it was showing 50%...so the battery is also good...4.there is some lag in sound while playing game CONCLUSION: THEY WILL BE MORE GOOD IF YOU CAN GET THEM IN SALE...Note: I got this product in 799 only üòÅüíùüíù
BoAt is actually Rocking!!,4.0,"BoAt Rockers 255 ! quality headphones.Best Sound Quality, Given 3 stars for Noise cancellation as it is not up to the mark.I got this blutooth headphones replaced in 1 week. BoAt ‚õµ warrenty service experience is very pleasant as I just post a request for replacement courier guy came to door step, collect the product and get it replaced in 1 week."
Nice Product from Boat Rokerz,4.0,"Nice Product from Boat Rokerz, Cannot expect too much at the price offered but serves the purpose. I use it to attend to calls and listen to music while walking or watching movies at night. Sound quality is decent (dont expect Dolby atmos :P)"
a great product with some little sort of adjustments,5.0,"such a great product incredible battery capacity i make it charged only once and it runs more than 40 + days and still running on , while driving and gym workouts its absolutly great in ear piece grip,sweat proof But noice cancelation and mic setup is terribly poor , handling the neckband is difficult while driving ,you can feel slight pain in ears after an hour use thats all"
Doesn't work with 2 devices compare to older version.,2.0,"I have both Rockerz Boat Rockerz and Boat Rockerz 255 Pro. I purchased expecting a new version will be better than older.But to my surprise, it's not, my main purpose is for dual device connectivity, with mobile and laptop. This new BaAt Rockerz 255 Pro doesn't work and the sound gets distorted when connected with 2 devices.Would like to mention the older version works much better than new."
VALUE FOR MONEY EARPHONES,5.0,"Guys hold your breath...I have just received the packaging from Amazon and after a couple of minutes I unpacked it and tried this new boat earphone.Believe me guys , well let me begin with the initials first.1. Here I would like to give amazon 100percent Mark's for packaging .It was so well packed and well received . Great job amazon2. Authenticity of product : I do not have any efficacy on the authentication of this product  Guys just at a blink of your eye, you know it's original.3. Sound quality:  awesome and coming4. Noise cancellation : I can't deduct any Mark's here although it does not provide that high end noise cancellations because guys these are not the noise cancellation earphones, pay some extra bucks and get the sony earphones if you want noise cancellation.."

Great one.. Go for it,5.0,Its my 3rd boat product.. Havng 225 and 235....And lovng boat.. Great productsIt is really a nice product.. I bought it for 999 and its a great deal..Pros:Great bassBattery backup nice.. About 6-8 hrConnectivity okMultiple device can be connectedOnly one  problem i want to mention is for playing pubg it is not the right one.. .. There is a 1 sec delay for the sound.. Thats a problem.. But it is not a big problem we can adjztBut overall at this price its a great deal.. Go for it
No dual connection,4.0,This one is the best bluetooth earphones you can get at this price range. However I'm disappointed that it states on website as dual pairing but it does not. Can someone from boat check the same.
Purchase only if price below 1000,3.0,Battery backup is about 4-5 hrs. Also the battery indicated is poor as after 80 percent it shows battery low without going though 60 or 40 percent.Ear pain will occur after using for more than 1 hr in continuation.Yes.. But managing is easy.Magnetic buds gives a good look is not in use.At last it's best in below 1000 price range
Overpriced,3.0,the product seems overpriced compared to the quality. .most importantly the charging cable is hardly 2 inches(cost cutting) may be. . .you want customers to hang these earphones near switch while charging?way too overpriced . .
Do not buy,1.0,"Been almost 20 days using this product, the voice sometimes is normal, but sometimes is extremely low.. I checked if my phone fault, but through my phone speakers it was so loudly audible, but while listening with this headset it was extremely low, I was not able to hear after pushing into my ears hard too! And can't even replace or return now since it's been 20 days... Also the fit is bad, I mean it doesn't stay in my ears for more than 5 mins, they slip slowly! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Good.,5.0,Sound quality is awesome. Charging doesn't take much time. Doesn't slip out even during a work out. Sweat resistant but do clean with a soft cloth later. Very light. Bluetooth range is optimum. Comes with extra rubber buds to suit your wearing comfort. All in all great product.
Good earphone with worst skin and annoying pre-installed voice,3.0,It is a good earphone considering the sound quality and noise cancellation but some things are annoying. Like the skin. The skin of my earphones lasted for 2 month then it started shedding. And when the battery goes to 10% charge it will repeatedly tell u in a voice with in 5 seconds...same when u connect or disconnect with your device.  I think they should provide just a beep sound. Charge doesn't exceeds 5 hours.  So I will give it a 3 star.
Item stopped working in less than a year,2.0,The product is very gud.. Gud music quality.. Gud  call quality..very heavy bass...Fits properly into the ears... Very gud while running and exercise... Only problem is the distance... The connection breaks as soon as the device is 20ft farther...Writing this after less than year of usage.. The item got damaged.. No sound on left ear.. Mic not working.. Major upgrade required for sweat protection..
Amazing product with best price,5.0,"I am using this product from past 7 days, I bought this for Rs. 1099. I got this product with 100% battery, right now after 7 days product has 40% battery. On an average 6-7 hrs of daily usage. Noise cancellation is not that good but bass and sound quality is awesome. If you looking for soft sound with a great bass then you must buy this."
Cheap quality built,2.0,Sound is okay but the product is cheap built. The colour wears out after just a months use. The plastic is also very cheap quality as the plastic chips . It's very badly built but as I got it for 1k it's okay in that price . But now at the same price you get so many better option. I also have realms wireless buds worth 1700 which is way better then this one even interns of sound.
It‚Äôs only nine days wonder ‚Ä¶ after 10 days it‚Äôs got out of order.,1.0,days wonder ‚Ä¶ after 10 days it‚Äôs got out of order.I‚Äôve had replaced however it‚Äôs found faulty.

Conquers the competition...,5.0,"Build: Well designed, lightweight and comfortable. The wires are good and not flimsy, wearing comfort is well maintained, better than Mi bluetooth earphones( the main competitor of boAt in the 1499 price category).Comfort: As mentioned above, these earphones are really comfortable, fits in the ear with no chance of slipping out (unless you're trying desperately and internationally). They're lightweight, so no hazard on that department. Perfect for long hours of music playback.Sound: The most important aspect of an earphone is the sound clarity, and boAt surely doesn't disappoint here as well. A bit base heavy but the sound is clear, crisp and loud. Good noise cancellation also helps to isolate the music playback. Although, judging from a pure audiophile's point of view, the Mi bluetooth earphones might have a more balanced sound signature, but boAt, being a bit base heavy, is just awesome for hip-hops or Bollywood genres. A music player with a good equalizer (preferably Poweramp for android) is going to elevate the listening experience even more.Battery: A single charge gives about 6-7 hours of music playback, which is decent enough, and full charge takes roughly about 1-1.5 hours.Verdict: In a nutshell, boAt Rockerz 255 is worth the price tag and then some. With it's better build quality, comfort, bluetooth range, it packs more punch than it's competition. For the extreme purists, the sound signature might be a bit turn off, but for most people, even for people with good ears, this is going be a great experience."
Best in the range and solid built.,5.0,Buy without any hesitation for daily commute and use. Good for music lovers and travel companion. In built voice assistance during power on/off and volume control.Built and batterywise better than SONY.
There's no accuracy,3.0,"One of my friends was using this and ive took and seen the audio quality, felt good and ordered one, the one which i have got is good but had some problem with operating buttons so i had to return it. These guys replaced the product but the sound quality is not matching the previous one, this is about sound andabout bluetooth for the first one i face problem when i connect and put my mobile pocket butfor replaced one im facing problem even while holding it lil closer to the headsetOverall product is good but not maintaining the same standards"
"""Boat Rockerz"" does not ROCK at all......",3.0,Build quality is not impressive. Noise cancellation is good. Light weight and easy to use. Call quality is good. Bluetooth connectivity is ok. Battery backup is good enough. But clarity of sound for which you buy is not impressive. Only bass effects you can feel but not up to the mark of prominency.
üòáWHY TO BUY & WHY NOT ü§∑,4.0,Pros: ‚óèThe sound quality is amazing for a ear set..‚óèThe entire wire is flexible so even if you sleep with it it won't be a problem.‚óèit can be easily carried along any where with any dress plus it didn't irritate my neck‚óè Rest everything till now is goodCons:‚óèalthough they provide extra ear plugs but it also has a extra support that gets into your external ear ( pinna) and I lost one of them.It usually gets loose when you adjust your ear sets . Now difficult to set one ear plus while running other wise while doing less activity it still retains in.
"Competes with Bose, This Boat Rocker is perfect fit and Best in class",5.0,"Good Headphones for Daily use, sturdy, flexible, unbreakable, Good quality built, Value for Money, Sound Quality is perfect, I would definitely recommend this to everyone. Has ear supporting extension for fitting perfect in ear."
Best at its segment,4.0,"I am using this since 2 weeks,product is excellentPros: 1)good quality sound,2)best battery life lasts for one week if u r heavy user or more than that,3)good build quality4)most value for money product.Cons:1)noise cancellations not good at calls2)vollume buttons are inverted position3) right ear bud will fall aftenly due to that dedicated mic is heavy"
battery backup awesome,5.0,"Very very nice product from boat,battery backup is awesome , while playback i used nearly 6 days for 6-7 hrs daily now its 7th day i think so because i forgot when i charged these headset still it has 30% battery in it.i got it for 1099 only for this price its very big deal need not to worry about it am reviewing after my usage only thanks for amazon for such a deal"
Need to improve Battery Life otherwise supurb product.,4.0,"As per price product is superb but need to improve battery life.I use this product last 7-8 month, it's still working good. I carry one more earphone in my bag pack during travel just bec. of this product battery lie down with in 2 hours."
Boat rockers rocks.,5.0,"Whatever the experts say. I am getting everything I want from this product. Happy to use this indian product with full satisfaction it matches the standard of many international brands. Bass is rich, surround sound is really good and fantastic noise cancellation"
"Not for long term, not worth spending rs.1000 just for 9 months of usage",2.0,"If you are looking for a product which would be reliable to you for the long term then this is not a product for you.It has a year warrantyAfter 9 months of usage, one earbud stopped working. I raised the complaint to their customer service. I received a replaced product after a month. Then again using for 15 days it does not get switched on and not able to pair to any of my devices.So if spending 1000 bucks and thinking to use if for a year or more.This product will more in the service center than with you."
One side stopped working,3.0,One side stopped working after 6 months of use. Got replacement which had the same problem.I will say don't go for cheap products buy another good headphone. Though lows are quite good.Sound quality is good.Not sturdy product.All of the boat product I've used and I've seen people using in headphone range always  gives some problems.
doesn't last long,2.0,"Very sad used it for only one hour daily. There is problem with the button, I can't switch them off or can change the volume. Now the battery does not last 1 hour and every day I need to charge them and can't now increase the volume. Please re think before you purchase, doesn't last long"
Nice,5.0,I don't have a image cos I ordered this one to my best friend. Sound quality is good we have bought earlier too 2 pairs all were good. You can buy it blindly coz it's boAt rockerzüòÑ
Worked for just once.. Then stopped working at all,1.0,"It worked wonderfully.. But for once only.. After dat, its not getting charged, though works only when its kept connected to a charger.. N at that time connected device shows dat its 100% charged.. As soon as its disconnected from charger, its switched off.. Is this for wat we buy a Bluetooth wireless headphone.. Pathetic.. Tell me d way I can use it or if I can return it as I hav thrown away d packing"
Boat rockerz 255 pro is very good interms of pricing,4.0,Boat rockerz 255 pro is very good in terms of pricing cause at this price im getting really good sound out which is loud enough for daily usage.Pros:>Sound quality and heavy bass>Pricing>Control buttons which are handy>Battery backup>Most important is Quick charging>U can connect with more than 1 device i used with my laptop and mobile same time.Cons:>I couldn't find any voice assistance button or gesture>Bass is heavy sometimes its irritating>Out of 10 times 2 times i have faced issues with connectivity.
Not great,2.0,"The sound is not bad at all , but when you are calling someone it distorts a lot . The Bluetooth range is bad , for example if the phone is in my pocket and i keep my hand on the earphones it stops , which should not happen. That's the only thing which is vey disappointing. It's not even a year and my left side earphone havw stopped working . Rather buy something else instead of this"
Good one,4.0,Better sound and quality. Value for money.Two things which bothers me.1: The controller on the head phone is not that great. Feels like you are touching a wood. Not a smooth plastic. Would appreciate a smooth finish.2: The description say it supports dual connectivity.Yes it supports. But there is some issue on handling it. Ex: i connect to my PC and phone.. but when i get a phone call I couldn't answer the call.And feedback voice for connecting and disconnecting is bit horrible.
Good for the price,4.0,"Sound quality is more than commensurate with the price, esp if one likes it bass heavy.Blutooth pairing is so painful at first that I almost returned the item to Amazon. But once my devices got paired somehow, the experience is seamless.The isolation (noise cancellation) is better than expected. One has to be careful while using this in a public place, because it cuts you off from almost all ambient noise.The best part of course is the lightweight yet sturdy construction, battery life (5-6 hrs), ear comfort and seamlessness. Range (7-8m) and sound quality are acceptable for the price.At INR 1499, this is good value for money."
Very good product. Best for bass lovers.,4.0,"Very good product, really liked it. But it deserves only 4 stars for fitting. Kinda disappointed with the fitting because the right side has the controller (power on, volume up and down) while using, it's a bit heavy and dosent fit properly, the left fits perfectly. So I have been using this since 2 weeks. The product is fantastic for bass songs 5/5, and it says its battery backup has 40hrs, but it dosent give that long (when in 100% charge), it lasts only for 12 hrs and the charge will be 20%."
Low battery performance,1.0,Works well in starting two months. But now after 2 mire months its battery drain more fastly. Can't play music for 6 hours now. It's a good product in this price but honestly I want to say that if you can push your budget then push it and buy a good bluetooth headset. In this range you can't get a proper thing. Instead buying this you should go for wired headset.i got exchange for two times in a year with same problem. so don't buy thisNot satisfied by battery performance üòë
Battery backup and bass is extreme level,5.0,Battery backup is best then other earphoneI use this for 10 days and not even charge and usually use 7-8 hour a day but battery is still 50% it is the best earphone and bass is extreme level i suggest to who are confuse what should buy other earphone or this buy this you are truly satisfy by this its my opinion because other may give you magnetic on off but sound quality and battery really matter in the earphone so dont waste your money to. Other and buy this
Review after a month usage,3.0,"It's fine for this price range, ear is paining during long usage. Some connectivity issues are there while it's already connected to some other device. Buttons are ok. Battery Percentage which is getting displayed in the Bluetooth icon of phone is not correct. While it's in 60% itself it's getting switched off. Battery backup not that great.No premium feel, if u r looking for that then it's not for u...Sound quality is pretty decent"
Worst company and worst product,1.0,"Within 3 months of purchase, one side of headphone was not workingAnd after searching of his customer center in gazibabad i reached their (with guaranteed card )and i found no physical center was their, and i came back  and after somedays second side was also not working, that was a joke seriously done by boat companyIts a totally fraud companyüëéworst product ever and worst service ever"
Stopped working left side after 4 months,1.0,What I liked:Battery life - 7 to 8 hours of continuous music (9/10)Music quality - good (7/10)Range- 8¬±4 mReview after using it 6 months:Left side - stopped workingRight side- working with reduced volume# earphone slips out of ear while even walking# the parts of the earphones that keep it tight to ears have lost bcoz after some time those became loose.#  lost 2 earlobes already because of looseness.# presently I'm not using this headphone.

DON'T BUY THESE.,1.0,Then product worked really well but only for first 2 weeks. After that it has stopped working.When I press the power on button earphones turns on but as soon as I release  the button it turns off.Earphones stays on only if I hold the power button continuously otherwise they just turn off.I don't recommend this product.Rather put in some extra and buy a good quality earphones.
The products are not promising as advertised.,1.0,"The quality of this product is not promising as they advertise, The bass is good but the sound quality is cheaper than roadside accessories sales person. Battery backup is good but the noise cancellation is not working. irritable rubber buds in neckband, I am disappointed with this product, I have also bought the earplugs it has sound quality like 150 rupees earphones.i will not recommend this brand.if someone have doubts. I can share the bill and videos."
A very good product for the value of its worth,5.0,"This is my second order from Boat rockerz and it did not disappoint me this time as well. The packaging was brand new and has no manufacturing defects.Sound quality is ok this time as well.I haven't experienced it's noise cancellation very much cuz my use isn't directed towards it.My review is going to be same for bass quality as the previous one.So over-all, good product & is worth it for an affordable price. üëçüëç"

Bad product received,1.0,"I had bought many Boat products from Amazon, but this time i had been disappointed  because of followings reason.1). Packging was not upto the mark . I had received it in the most disappointing method one can receive it in a crushed box all bend and torn out.2). Product broken:- left earbud of the boat 255 is not working. Charger cable didnt worked properly"
A wireless that stays with time,5.0,"Really, this machine was a hell of device it is truly reliable and works and also sounds great. I am an average user, the battery life was ok-ish, built was superb, ergonomics was good. Customer service was Good and responsive. Good, recommend."
Excellent product .....,5.0,"I don't have any ideas about earphones' quality. But when I checked the item I feel best sound quality, bass quality. I can't say about noise cancellation because I have no idea about it but I feel it is also good."
Bluetooth is very efficient,5.0,"I liked the function of Bluetooth, which is very efficient. gets connected easily in any locations, even in the close proximity with high tension lines, which other similar appliances fail to get connected."

Unreliable below average product.,1.0,"Product is below average in terms of music experience.Volume is lower than other headphones. Sound Quality is just average.Lags is startup, disturbing & irritating  music experience, if u r mobile is in trouser pocket.All this can still be accepted!!!!Biggest problem is reliability, since last 1 year, i had to replace it 3 times under warranty.Just after 3 months of last replacement, warranty is over and right side speaker stopped working.Ridiculous!!! I would never buy again, neither suggest to buy."
Pathetic experience,1.0,"Worst experience, in few months use I was so obsessed with the quality and use of the headset but after few months i got issues with wired disconnect issues and one earpiece got damanged, then after registering complaint, I got repaired even after asking for replacement, then within 3mnth again gpt same issues, this time when I asked for registering complaint, the service centre asked me to visit the centre cox there is no online pickup in metro cities, another option he gave for parceling the same to mumbai ofc on my charge, I don't know what is the use of replacement and warranty then? Although 3mnths left in warranty over period, and second time issues and worst customer service.I would never recommend anyone in future."
Good product in its price range,4.0,"I am using boat rockers Bluetooth earphone or laast 7 months. I forget my old one at home so I bought again rockers 255. All over. Product is good, base quality, sounds cancellation is good the only issue I faced in this model is, when some one call me they complaints that my voice is coming very low although sound is at its max. Otherwise product is good as per the budget range. You can go for it."
Not satisfied first time at amazon,3.0,May be received 2nd hand product... there is too much dust inside this box... Surely this is a returned product ... Slightly disappointed with seller
Best in this price range,4.0,One thing about boat products are it's low price. I got this for 999 rs. The noise cancellation is not too notch. At times there a Bluetooth connectivity issue. One can use it for jogging and all. It's splash proof. Overall value for money . A must buy if you are in budget
"Great Product, Good Battery Backup & Worth for the price.",4.0,"The voice quality is good and it connected to Android, IPhone, Mac..It has a very good battery backup, I got up to 6 Hours in average usage.I bought this product is 2018 and it worked fine without any issues till 5 days before completing 1 year.  I called Boat  customer care and they gave me a brand new product, but it was not 255 (that's okay)."
Bluetooth headset problem,5.0,Bluetooth headset not working properlySome times Bluetooth not connecting in case connected the Bluetooth one side headset not working. Already I have same Bluetooth headset working properly but last time purchased Bluetooth headset performance very bad and I am not satisfied. Kindly update the next level and respond immediately.
You'll loose the Wingtips,5.0,Good value for the money but leaves something to be desirrd in terms of audio quality.The wingtips get loosen over time and end up being lost .There arnt any wingtips available for spare in the box.This should have been a deal breaker for me if i had know this before buying
Worst company and support services.,1.0,"Worst brand ever it worked till return policy day ends, after that it stopped working, and boat is not opening it's service center due to covid restrictions, and even in Mumbai they don't provide door to door services. Worst"
Earphone is in very bad condition,1.0,"I received used earphones this is really very very disappointing.I received one kind of garbageI didn't notice but delivery agent provided me loose packageThey pasted box with glue/fevicolI didn't received any charging cabel, manual and budsEven product was used by someoneEarphone is in very bad conditionI'm sharing some image of products which i received"
A headphone with good sound but poor noise cancellation,3.0,"Sound quality is really good and charging-discharging speeds as claimed by the manufacturer. But when on call other person hear noises (sounds of vehicles passing by, clicking noise from ceiling fan) way more louder. I used to crack this joke 'maybe thay have fit noise cancellation hardware inverted as it's enhancing and not cancelling' on every call.Since my jobs demands me to be on call everyday I won't buy this earphones again."
Awesome product!,5.0,Very happy with the product. Been using it for last one month. Pairing in seconds. Sound quality is pretty good. I mostly use it for listening to music from Spotify/ Gaana. It comes with 3 different sizes of plug. I changed to small one which fits well in my ears. The legs are rubbery and very flexible so sits in the ear properly. Go for it!!
Harsh sound,3.0,"It‚Äôs looks very ordinary. I doubt it‚Äôs durability .  Quality of sound is little bit harsh. MRP on product is 2990, for its quality price should be 499."
Nice wireless earphone within Rs 1000/-,4.0,"Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery!I am writing this review after 3 days usage, Sound quality is good,not very loud,good Bluetooth connectivity and comfortable to ears for long usage. But battery backup of this headphone disappoints.I have used this in mild rain also and it works perfectly fine. Heavy bass lovers may not like this, otherwise within Rs.1000/- with a one year replacement warranty it is a good option."
Awesome Product. No regret,4.0,I didnt want to buy. But I saw a lot of reviews and feedback about this earphones. So i finally I ordered and trust me I didnt regret. Awesome sound quality with high bass. People who like more bass definitely u shoukd go for it. Battery back up is also good. If u r sports person the hooks on earphones does it work fabulously. It dont allow to come out of ur ears.Cons:1. Bluetooth range should have been more2. Battery back up should have been more.
Low product quality,2.0,"I had purchased the product few months back.......and one of the earplug has stopped working....Even buying such a branded product at a expensive rate ,quality is not good.My suggestion for you would be kindly work on the product quality..... because the product which I have received has not yet completed 6 months also and it has stopped working.Till yesterday only 1 pair was not working, and now both the earplugs are not working.......it was such a pathetic experience......and I would never suggest anyone to buy this earphones"
Honest Review - Average Headset,3.0,"Hi,This is a average quality headset. But in this price range I would say it is a good buy for sure.Pros:1. Very good battery backup. Last 6-7 hours on a average use.2. Build quality is good. Fit perfectly to the ears.3. Connects two device at a time. Connects easily.4. Less charging time.5. Very comfortable to wear.Cons:1. Sound quality is average. Don't expect much. You have to use equaliser otherwise no use.2. Call quality is not good. It could be better3. Connectivity issue if your mobile device is far from your headaet, even while your mobile device in pocket, sometime you will observe connectivity issue.Verdict- Well if you are a great music lover and if you are looking for a headset which has great sound quality than this is not a ideal device for you. However, if you want to use this device casually on a day to day basis like join meetings or gym etc than this a most value for money deviceThanks,Sourav"
No Call Vibration Functionality,1.0,"The product I received is not the new product. It was opened and used. Resealing was manually. Do not what kind of sellers are registered in Amazon. Ideally this product can be listed under refurbished products.In terms of products reviews, still there is opportunity to work improve bass quality. There is no call vibration facility available."
Basically garbage,3.0,"I'm not happy that boat made these sub par headphones. They sound quality feels tinny. And the build quality was bad. The rubber casing came loose on one end after a month of use and i use it with the wire dangling out of the casing now. Not happy with this purchase. Then again, they didnt cost too much."
Mind boggling product!! üòé,5.0,I can't get enough of this earphones.. Sound qulity is so clear in highs and lows.. Battery life is more than expected from a bluetooth earphone.. It is showing more than 1 day battery life. And the quality of the material used is so nice... I am happier than expected.. And thank you amazon for fast delivery.
Excellent product,5.0,"excellent product from boat, amazing sound quality, the bass is so satisfied even better than the one+ neckband and i am writing this review after using it for like 1 year, just the battery can be better, it will last like 24hr if you use it non stop continuously and 2days for normal use, but it's fine you know for the quality sound and durability"
"Good product, could have been better",4.0,"The sound quality is good, but there is some low buzzing noise. It is a good product at an affordable price for calling, playing games, movies, music, and other general-purpose tasks. But if you are a hardcore fan of listening to music, then I don't recommend it"
Connection problem in recent purchase,3.0,"Very bad experience, im using boat fir last 4 years but recently I order this and it's a garbage. It takes 2 days to connect with my mobile. Not showing the boat sometime  and when showing not pairing. Range good but often it making noise like I'm in distance from mobile when it's in front of me. I replace with another but it's same."
It's too bad product and now not working,1.0,"It's too bad product and  last from  three month it's not working now. Its have one year warranty but no option is here. Please tell me, how to return and how to can gate it again in working position.Please contact my mail I'd tamannakhushijangir@gmail.comAnd mobile no 7710823109"
Below average,3.0,1. Aptx is not working . my phone can support.2. volume below 25% or 20% is.. literally zero3. not water proof.4. bulid quality is so so so cheap.5. Baaki sound quality average . Bass average.6. Battery..achi h..Koi dikkat nhi. battery se.7. Not recommendable.
Good headphone for budget,4.0,I like this headsetBattery lasts longer 5-6 hours approxQuality of sound is goodConnects easilyLight weightBuild quality goodIt pains in the ear after 15-30 mins of usage its little uncomfortable even after changing the buds size.
Charging issue.,3.0,"The packaging, delivery everything is OK. I was happy with the sound quality. Earlier there was a little bit problem to connect it with my Red MI Note 4 mobile phone. But later on I was able to connect it. But within a month the headphone stopped charging."
This doesn't have an active noise cancellation as mentioned in features.,1.0,"Please do not buy this product. This doesn't have an active noise cancellation as mentioned in features. During call and sending audio messages, very much of surrounding noise disturbance is there. Even the sound of my friends from the other room is also being detected in audio messages and call. But active noise cancellation feature is added in their features list. Sound quality and bass are nice. Dual pairing is not that much smooth."
Value for money for sure !,4.0,Music - better than boultBass- better than boultBuild quality - better than boultBattery - better than boultCall handling - boult is betterErgonomics - boult is betterEar comfort - boult is better
Unintuitive,1.0,While the performance itself isn't bad it lacks basic intuitive features like switching off automatically when the buds are magnetically connected like on the Oneplus bullets. This feature goes a long way when you're constantly on calls. The long press to switch off/on is not handy especially since it doesn't have auto switch on/off.I'd rather shell out a couple hundred bucks more for the OnePlus bullets just for the intuitiveness.
Try for alternate upgrades is boat,3.0,"I bought this @1500 , product is good by quality but it will work for 6-7 months only. I got a neck wire issue which is unable to resolved. Its also a sweat proof but after daily use I got wire issue. Battery life and sound quality is very much appretiated. No Noise cancelation."
After just a month.. Burnt on charging,1.0,Sound quality is awesome but today I had kept it on charging & the side on which there is the charging port & other buttons... the headset melted & it's not even working now. Melted on charging... it became so hot that it could not be touched. Posting a photo so that all can see. 1 star coz of poor quality of material & build which melts in a month when just kept for charging
Rest all is okay but battery backup,4.0,"Not really impressed..Sound, Bass, Noise cancellation all is just okay like every other good quality headphones.. One extra Star‚≠ê I gave for longer battery life and better bluetooth connectivity with good range.."
Best earphone,4.0,"One of the best earphone with good sound balance with Bass and treble. Earbuds and comfortable, it hurts initially, you need to fix it properly on the ears. I was able to take up call without any distortion. The people in the other side were able to listen without any background sound.  I haven't checked the battery life. I hope it should provide at least 6 hrs.This is my second earphone from Boat. Boat is rocking. Listening the music through OnePlus 7 !!"
My honest review,3.0,"The earphones are great for casual use, I prefer some other earphones for running, training cause the wire is heavy and keeps banging onto my neck it's the worst feeling, the ear hooks are flimsy so it's not having great stability.Sound-4/5Quality -4/5Comfort-3/5For training-2.5/5"
Sound Breaking,1.0,Jab device ko  mene phone se connect kiya to kuch time tak to thik chal ab usme sound break ho rahi h song sunne ya YouTube ya koi video dekhne Or online class lene me bhi sound break ho rahi h mene usse reset bhi kar liya phir bhi thik nhi hui abhi 8 din huye h mujhe isse liye huye Or ab iski return policy bhi khatam ho gyi h mere pese barbaad ho gye isse lene se mein kitne time se ghar wale se pese mang raha tha Bluetooth earphones lene ke liye or jab pese mile to mene ye liya itna bakwas
Budget earphone ü§ó,5.0,I bought this earphone after searching so mang youtube unboxing videos then I got this earphone in such a reasonable price in prime day sale so the sound quality is great and bluetooth connection is ok ok and the call quality is awesome so must go for it in cheap segment earphone.
Too high bass makes the music feel trash,3.0,Honest review if you love bass then it's good but it's not the thumping bass it's literally an unbalanced bass which makes ur head shook. Moreover sound quality deteriorates just coz of this bass and charging speed is normal not a fast charger. And battery capacity is good not that gr8 but acceptable. At the end for a price range of 999 it's a good deal but could have been better if the quality of bass is improved.
Not for audiophiles,3.0,"Its got good bass. but it range for  treble or Mid range is lacking.If You are audiophile.. You will notice it's lacking. Just one day into use.Did some tests... Yes, it lacks in higher frequencies.However with equalizer it helps a bit.Built wise good.. And will last long"
Battery life is a beast. (With lower volume),4.0,"I am writing my review after using it for 4 days nonstop. Battery has been proving to be the best pro side of the earphones.I am using earphones mostly for music and some calling feature.Microphone is good and so is audio clearity to other person.With 4 days of continue use mostly in daytime (less than 10 hour a day) it stands at 40% battery and i assume it can last 6 days with less usage with ease. Would recommend to buy if you hate wired eaephones.Sound quality is upto the mark and its comfortable to leave around your neck, you dont feel the weight."
Worst for caller's because of noise cancellation is zero,1.0,It's really irritating for another person while talking on call and after use of 20 day's some little kichkich sound coming while listening songs or watching videos....

Pathetic product,1.0,Third class product. Got the first one that had battery issues. Like the battery just lasted for 1-2 hrs. Then placed a replacement order and again got a defective product which was not pairing with any of my apple devices.First one paired smoothly with iphone and my macbook but had battery issuesSecond one has good battery life when connected to android phone but unable to connect to my iphone or macbookPathetic product
Worst Sound and Poor mic,2.0,Sound quality is very poor no bass at all. Looking good but in terms music experience which is the real purpose of headphone is like street side product which usually available near metro. Honestly I had a not good experience with Boat. So if wants you buy this product for just a show piece or decorate your neck then go ahead.I initiated this product for Return and Refund.
Pathetic service and product,1.0,"This head set does not even last for 3 months. Replacement comes with lot of conditions. Their service center is pathetic and unapologetic. Head set gets heated up or melts will charging even in laptop charging its heats. Other products like JBL, Samsung, Sony are more nicer than and respond well. I FEEL HAVE WASTED 1600 AND TIME AND MONEY SPENT FOR REPLACEMENT"
Average Headset,3.0,"Just an average budget headset.Good budget Bluetooth headset .Sony, JBL and any branded headset users don not buy this.You will be disappointed.I would say everything is average and not bad.I was using Sony and so not much satisfied.Worth only for 999 and not more than that."
Great experience.,5.0,"It fullfills all requirement of music lover, action movie lovers, those who talk for long and those who listens audio books.Bass is high, it depends on choice. But it doesnt kill trebel, mid and high tones so listening is wonderful experience.Connectivity is very fast and battery backyup is 6hrs+ in playtime.Rest all is good."
Used product,1.0,The item I received was used and was in not working condition. I placed a replacement request and it turned out to be absolute scam. The pick up/delivery agent marked as I rejected the replacement but the actual situation was that he was not able to create the request at his end. By end of everything I had to create a return request.Please do not furnish the customers with the used products. It‚Äôs really very annoying to receive the used products despite paying the full charge.
Great for Music listening ; But not for taking calls.,4.0,Listening to Music: 8/10The sound quality of the earphones is good. The bass sounds are slightly over boosted; which may annoy some of the listeners. Bass lovers can buy without hesitation.Connecting Calls: 6/10The call quality is disappointing. The inbuilt mic is not that great. The other person's voice that we hear during a call is also slightly distorted when compared with the call without Bluetooth earphones.Over all build quality is good.
Good quality only for 2months. Later it is again a waste of money.,3.0,The quality of the product was overall good but it's been just 2months of use and already one ear has stopped working. If u really don't want to waste money then don't buy this product becoz by 2 to 3 months you'll also face the same problem. And the waranty is just for name sake as u can't get it fixed anyhow. Think before spending so much. If the product works in good condition only for 2 months then u can buy many other brands which are actually cheaper and also good in quality. And even  if that product stops working you can buy two of those  in the money spent for this product so basically that would last much longer than this.
Worst Battery Backup,1.0,"Playing one song at 80% battery terribly drains in just 2 songs.  While in drowned in the music, you can hear the Boat Rockers Music Director sayings "" Opps Battery Low"".  Make it beep then playing the most every awkward heard posing american accent. Utterly disappointed. Guys go for JBL. It seems to be Quoted Indian version of Xi Jinping portrayed as made in India."
Honest review after 6 month use,2.0,"I purchased this earphone on 29 September 2019. Sound quality is good, also bluetooth connectivity is good. After full charge it will work for maximum 3-4 hrs. But I don't recommend it. Today, on 4 April 2020 one side of earphone stop working. Though it has 1 year warranty period can't claim warranty now due to lockdown period üòïüòï. Let's see what happened."
Value for money,4.0,I bought them for around 1200 in salePros :-Awesome sound qualityBeast battery backup (Boat is lying about 6hrs backup as i have already used them for a movie and 1 hr call and 30-40 songs and overall usage for more than a day and still 60% battery left)Support Buds for earphones do good work for holding on the earphones in earVoice and beats are very clearCall quality is satisfactoryBuild quality is superb.Splash proofCons:-Support earbuds start causing pain in ear for long use but thank god they are removableStrap around the neck is good but strap goind towards buds is quite thin. Handle with careSmall range as it is 4.1 Bluetooth with less than 10m coverage
Best product...,5.0,"I bought this product September of 2019. Used almost all the time in a day, In gym, college, while on travel. Its 100% sweat proof. And was used roughly and today one side of speaker stopped working, the problem was rough usage in the wired area. Battery backup is execellent. I used to charge it once in 2 days. If u give care to the wired region while using the prdct would last more 3 years.."
Superior quality for music,4.0,"Sound and bass quality is superior in price 999 as I bought during festive offers but noise cancellation is not good means not this any neckband I ever used even Samsung level u or u flex bault curve, every single neckband didn't give you noise cancellation whenever you are crowded with few people who were chattering, then the listener will also hear their voice which is more disturbing and that's why you have to put off your neckband for just to talk them for long conversation but if you are almost alone and your place is quite then this is the best neckband and if you want to buy it only for music then go for it it's amazing bass and sound quality will amaze you with it's superior quality sound."
not good sound..Not recommonded,2.0,Except the looks and battery backup i think nothing is good. Sound is of below average quality...after listening to sony i applied this and i could not fathom why such good ratings..rather try out philips/sony wired earphones guys..could not return as packaging was thrown by maid..üò™
Amazing (try to get it under 1000),5.0,"I use two Bluetooth earphones ( boat and boult).And both have good sound quality, high bass. Good competition.But i personally recommend boult wireless earphones on the basis of convenience to use ( coz wires came from behind the neck).At sound level both are amazing."
UPER POOR QUALITY,1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS ONLINE AT ALL. Pls include option of negative rating as well. This deserves a - 10.It did not last even for 20 days. The thing got disintegrated on its own like a sci fi gadget ....utterly poor quality. Surely it was a duplicate piece. Pls blacklist the vendor at once since the company is earning a bad name .
"Manufacturing defect in this product, please avoid buying",1.0,"There is a manufacturing defect with this product. I have been in touch with BOAT . They replaced it once but the replaced product has same issue (when both ear buds are connected together magnetically, music still comes through them).BOAT hasn't responded to my email that is sent a week before. Hoping to get a refund!"
Nice product,4.0,"Boat rockers is a good quality earphone for this price range. Because most of the companies providing the similar earphone at double the price. I got this product at Rs 999 and l am very happy with this product. Having 4-5 hr battery backup and it charge quickly.When I am listening music it will withstand up to 5 hrsWhen I am using for audio call it will withstand nearly 3-3.5 hrAlso I can watch a complete movie with out any doubt.And I found few disadvantages like, when you are listening music continually for hours during the journey and you keep your mobile inside your bag, then some times the music will suddenly stops and after some time it will become connected.Also it is a very bass boosted product"
Honest owner opinion. Replaced twice in 8 months due to the fault in earbuds,1.0,Honest owner opinion:Sound quality - 3/5Sound quality is better than JBL/sony wireless within this price range.Bluetooth connectivity- 2/5It takes long time to connect automatically. More often need to connect by clicking on device name.Same for multiple devices. Does not auto connect to more than 1 device.Note: within 8 months I have replaced it twice. Over the period headphone's right side has stopped working. Then the left side.Customer care was not helpful throughout the process. Boat sent me new packed earphones in replacement. In next 3 months same thing happened again. And right side of the earphone stopped working.
After 10 days rough use,4.0,"10 days after replacement ..Build quality 3/4* (ok quality but not look premium)Sound quality 4/5* (great not deep bass but good enough to enjoy your songs)Battery 3.5/5* (3 to 4 hrs on playback , enough for a normal day use ) (on Standby great backup)Noice cancelation 4/5* (no one can easily disturb you)Durability 3.4/5* (very rough using but didn't found any sign of damage let see how long)Comfortable in üëÇ ear with hook 2.5/5* (painful) 3/5* without hook"
Low quality product.,1.0,It has very bad connection issues and as the time goes by the sound quality decreases that is usage of only 15 days( Bought on 7th November 2021) . The product is not switching on and if by luck it switches on will last for 5mins and then disconnects.A request not to buy this product.
Bad Quality,1.0,It is not coming more than 6 months even after replacing warren also it came another 4 months lifeBut warren replacement was happened one time happy for thatOverall unhappy with productPlz improve quality of the product as u know the cost of product is not lessIt should meat the customer expectations
Really a good product. Worth the money only if bought in some sale/dicount.,4.0,"Its a great product. would have beeen better if the charging port was type-C, but its not the case. the micro usb charging port is a bit delicate. Also the ear buds are kindof a bit bigger than the regular wiered earphones, thus long time usage results in pain in the ear. the battery life is good only if u are closer to the decive connected.; if ur connected device is a bit far away (eg-in other room) then the battery drains pritty fast."
Good Quality and value for the money,5.0,"Fast delivery by Amazon. Just 2 days. Item received just today.First impression is soo well and i feel its worth the amount i paid for this item. The bass is good. It fits in the ears properly.Only i found a very little negativity is that the length of the cable. It just pops out of my shirt/Tshirt, feels little uncomfortable. Else everything is perfect with this product. 4.5/5"
Just an average product.,3.0,"Okay so the service was great. But the earphones didn't last, only in 4 and a half months later it's not taking charge. I've tried using different cables and adapters but nothing helped. Sadly due to the lockdown I'm not even able to have it repaired by the service center. The product is extremely unreliable, sound and bass are not TOO good if you're a edm or bass lover. Bluetooth connectivity range is pretty low, the voice gets distorted. Also the build quality, the wires keep hanging in front which is really awkward sometimes. A product like this at a price range of 1.3k is alot."
Doesn't deserve to be rated.,1.0,"The 1st time when I received the product, it had scratches on it. The product looked tampered. Hence placed a request for a return.  The 2nd time when I received the product, it did not work at all. The boat DIST/dealer sent a DOA product. Such an awful QC. I didn't expect as I am already using their other products and had respect for the brand. I doubt whether I will buy any product of this brand in the future."
Kept disconnecting in calls,3.0,"A decent wireless headphones. Doing quality and bass was ok. Obviously in this price range it was good. However it didn‚Äôt worked for me as the Bluetooth kept disconnecting in all calls and also the other party voice used to sound robotic, it used to be unrecognisable. Hence I had to return the headphones and now looking for some other headphones."
Just ok product. Otherthan bass quality nothing great about,3.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Bass is extremely good. No doubt. mic clarity is very poor, especially during outside. Mic noise cancelation is not effective. Ear buds are comfort enough and completely conceals the ears so during driving you should use only one side, otherwise you cannot hear the other vehicles horns etc., After usage for some long time of 1hr or so it pains in the ears. Battery back up is 4 to 5hrs hardly. Please be careful that once battery charge comes down to 20%, it switches off...bluetooth connectivity range is very short."
Good on pocket friendly budget.,5.0,"Had purchased 02 Rockerz 255 earlier and gifted it to my colleagues, they were impressed, so during the Amazon Sale purchased another 02 and gifted them to my other colleagues, they too were happy with the products, all 04 of them are very satisfied with my choice and now they approach me for any purchases related to electronics."

"An SUV ran over the earphones, but still working!",5.0,"Let me tell you this, I've used Bose, Beats, Sennheiser, Audio technika, JBL, Skullcandy, boAts and many tens of top and mid level brands. But I'm a fan of boAts for their Price - Satisfaction ratio and used many of their products and never was disappointed.Bought these earphones, I liked the build as soon as I saw them, loved the thumping bass when I tested it with multiple songs, loved the audio clarity too.And then an amazing thing happened.I was wearing them and was riding my motorcycle a bit faster and they blew away. An SUV drove over it. I thought I lost the earphones. But when I put the buds in my ear, songs were still playing as loud, as clear as ever.Button areas were damaged so badly but still, working perfect. I did not find any problem till now. I'm loving it.Perfect value of money.*I wish I could have a replacement*"
Poor connectivity.,2.0,"I am writing this review after replacement headsets. First worked for few days then started playing up. Keeps disconnecting and breaks in between video plaly,  audio play regardless online or offline. Today is the first day of replacement piece and it's ditto same,  every few minutes keeps saying"" You are now connected to boatrockers"" and shows 100% battery available???  Amazing how on earth it can stay 100 % even after few hours usage?  I am returning this back and would take refund and not replacement this time. It is very annoying exeperince."
Need to be more enthusiastic and punctual..,5.0,"1..Product is duplicate..2.. Sound quality is very bad3.. boat rockerz 255 earphone box is different ( box is not original )4.. When we turn on the earphone it says 'POWER ON '. But the original Boat rockerz 255 earphone says "" Welcome to boat rockerz 255 "" Something like that5.. sellers  may try to deceive people but people trust on "" Amazon "" so it's duty of  ""Amazon Service provider "" ( Everyone who works for Amazon ) to make sure that we are providing a good service/product to the Customer..6..I have applied for return request Thrice and still No one has come to pick up the product..( pick up time has been increased three times )7..I am happy to being a Part of Amazon8..Being a part of Amazon, I request everyone (every person working for Amazon) to be more enthusiastic than before  and try to provide best service.Thanking you,Yours Sincerely,Mr. Divyaraj Dipak Gonde"
Buy this without hesitation,4.0,"Really cool earphone... But within a year you'll face issue of one side or sometimes both side... As you got warranty you'll get new one... But replacement process also takes long time...Except this sound quality, bass are really good, noise cancellation is not that good..."
Nice product,5.0,This is nice product. Using this for 2 months now. Best feature of this product is it gets connected with 2 devices at same time. I use this with my laptop n mobile at same time n this device is intelligent enough to start voice of laptop calls or mobile calls based on call which gets first. Overall battery life last for 8 hrs but fast charging helps as it takes 45 mns only. Overall a nice product
Recommend in Bluetooth headphones,5.0,The product is amazing when it comes to sound quality and the material used in the making.It works decently at it's low pricing but the pannel of buttons on the headphones have stopped responding which as caused the Mic to not work as well.But still the songs play well with any issues.....
Spoilt in 3 months. Don't buy,1.0,Went bad in 3 months. Makes transmitter like noise when switched on & doesn't power off.  Keeps making this noise till the battery drains. Very frequently disconnects. Suddenly will power off in the middle of a call.
Very worst quality and I think it is defected copy product.,1.0,Very worst quality and I think it is defected product. The seller cheated me with the dublicate product. Very poor sound quality call experience. I think it was not boat it is copy product.I used the same boat heatset from my frnd it was awsome. I inspired from him and bought this product.. But it was worst in sound quality. I never no where is the problem araised. But I was cheated.... ü•∫ü•∫üò≠üò≠üò≠
Detailed review based on my usage experience,4.0,"1 week and no issue still eligible for replacement. Nice product when I've bought this it came with battery 100% charged. Easily give you upto 5.5 hrs of playback. Bluetooth range is not that good I mean if you always need to go away from your device from where you are playing this earphones then you will find that, range is not that good but if you aren't go away from device like you use it while using laptop or you use it with mobile phone and while listening you keep your phone in pocket or in simple words if you are not going away from it then it is best for you but for people who needs more range then this is not for you. Talking about sound quality nice little bit bass boosted but you will love it. Noise cancellation works fine."
Keeps slipping off,3.0,"No radio access. Just plays audio of any video which is playing. Uncomfortable ear plugs. Keeps slipping. If pushed tightly, head and neck pains. Very good sound quality and noise cancellation when it remains in the ear."
Poor Connection quality,3.0,"Voice breaks in between and sometimes we can't even hear on the call.The cap for charging cable has a sensitive joint which can break after usage for a few weeks.Sound quality, otherwise, is fine."
Horrible product,1.0,Horrible product with mic issues on call. The customer service is even worse. The customet service number is unavailable for last 5 days. There has been no update on the replacement of the headphone. They picked up the product the next day with no replacement or any update on when the product will be replaced. It has been 10 days that I am trying to get in touch with the customer service but the number is either unavailable or the office is closed.The sound quality is ok but the bluetooth connectivity and on-call mic is not working at all.
Excellent product,5.0,"Hey folks , I initially made a choice of buying it in store where the price was ‚Çπ2.5k but then thought to try in amazon coz it had 7 days replacementI received the day after I orderThis is amazing perfect bass,sound cancellation, lite ,comfortable 5/5although it's lil expensive than other bluetooths but completely worthBattery backup is superb ,just go for it if u really need the best"
Stopped working after 10 months,1.0,"I am writing this review after 10 months,After 10 months 1 earpiece is now not working,Now I can't do anything,no warranty now...Now I have to buy again another product ..Now about sound quality is good,bass is good but noise cancellation is not enough and battery is worst and unpredictable...Now I recommend dont go for it,"
Headphones are good with best quality,4.0,Headphones are goodBass 4.5Noise cancellation 5.0Durability 4.5Battery life 4.5After use of 2 months I'm writing this reviewLeft side of headphones is not working so I've returned the product to boAt.PS- I've already returned the damage product to Amazon seller so be careful while buying the product
Please don't waste your money buying this product,1.0,So its a complete made in china product. For initial period of 10 -15 days it was working good. After that 1st battery backup started decreasing then after few more days it started behaving strangly getting off automatically. Now the situation is that it gets off as soon as i turn it on .Worst cheap quality product.!!!!!!!!Do not recommend it to anyone!!!!!!!!
if you are confused between new and old version,5.0,"this headphone is really great if you are confused between old and new model then definitely go with this modelthis model have super sound and quality bass and its charge less than 1 hour so its plus point of this headphone . i only hate one thing about this headphone is whe i increases volume till the end headphone says ""maximum volume""so its very disturbing for meotherwise headphone is good its worth product"
Don't Go for it...it's a genuine review,2.0,I don't know if anyone will read this...but if anyone does...please do not buy this earphones now....it is too outdated + the sound quality is not at all good and neither is the bass quality as mentioned in the titleI buyed it on 30th June 2020 and I'm regretting it as it has Bluetooth 4.1 which is like 2 years old...My suggestion - go for its pro version rockerz 255 pro...it's ‚Çπ500 expensive but worth it...or if your budget doesn't allow you to go that much then go for jbl infinity glide...it has both good vocals and a descent base...Hope it helps....
AWESOME SOUND...BUT MOST BAKWAS SERVICE OF BOAT... DONT BUY,1.0,"Sound of the headphone is superb, super punchy bass, everything was excellent but after using the product for 5 months one side of the ear is not working. Raise a complain request to Boat and on very next day one pickup executive from Delhivery came and picked up my headphone. From that day I have repeatedly trying to contact with the service centre but nobody attending my call... PURA CHINA KA MAAL HAI BHAI, ""AFTER SALE SERVICE"" KA KOI GUNJAISH HI NAHI.. I strongly won""t recommend Boat so far service is concern. Rest up to you...PEACE"
Good sound quality at a reasonable price,3.0,The sound is average not that good as compared to JBL and some other great brands. The bass is more but treble is less. If u travel on a bike or cycle and wind is blowing at a higher speed then there is lag in Bluetooth connection. Overall good at the price of 999. If you want great quality sound go for JBL or boult or Bose.
Boat rocker rocks....,5.0,Great earphones.. i got it during diwali sale for 1k... And I'm using it since then.. sound and bass is great.. battery life is good too. Play back time is nearly 7hours and charges quite fast too.. looks smart... U can go for it if you want a Bluetooth headphone..
Worst ever... Returned it in a day,1.0,"Worst product probably ever I have purchased on Amazon, ordered it received a faulty device unable to hear the other person's voice lot of disturbance in the clarity of the tone replaced i, to my dis may even the replaced device is a ditto of the one which I returned,made yet another return and my amount is been refunded....Worst ever boAt speakersi have ever turned out to...... still bass is good to hear songs,But at 1k + it's not only fa hearing songs, it should do it's purpose unfortunately it haven't ......A big thumbs down boAt 255"
Superb product,4.0,Writing this review after 2years of rigorous use.It‚Äôs such a great product to buy and solves all purposes. Had a speaker issue in between but got the product replaced within 10days.After 2years I‚Äôm facing battery issue but that‚Äôs worth every penny!
Awesome...go for it..,4.0,"Really good product. Using it from last 15 days and so far nothing to say as disadvantage. Material is good it comes with spare ear buds. Charger cable is very short but manageable. Go for it, you will not regret. Thanks Amazon for timely delivery. I wanted black colour which is still out of stock, but this colour is also good."
Good product,4.0,"I always buy boat as my primary choice but on a specific day due to some extra offer prize I brought Nu Republic Bluetooth headset and then ordered boat for my brother after 2 weeks. But really guys Nu Republic Jaxx 3 provide provides better sound quality than boat.In terms of bass and battery, boat is better as always."
Bad Quality,1.0,"I purchased it, and its not suitable for my ears...I bought it for ‚Çπ1199, now they are selling it at ‚Çπ999, I want my refund and i applied for return and now they are replacing my product..What is this behaviour amazon, i have been purchasing so mny products... This product is not suitable for me.. I wanna something else....Please refund my money, i dont want a replacement product...."
Great headphones for the prƒ±ce,5.0,"Overall a great earphones.Good bass and sound quality, water/ sweat resistant, handy, charge stays for good time, not uneasy on neck.I do run with this one and is great üëç.Only con was the grip on the earbuds fell off after some use."
Awesome,5.0,I am a new customer in Amazon. After using it for 13 days I am giving my review. The rockerz 255 pro is really awesome product as I expect. It is beyond my expectation. But one thing those who like to listen music in base. The headphone is really for those only. Battery quality is quite good. It can give you 1 day battery backup if you are a heavy user. For gamers I think this is really good for those. Overall nice experience.
Great Product for the price,5.0,"It is a great product for the price. Bass effect is good making the music more enjoyable. Voice clarity for phone calls gets a tick. It may not been great if you are using when riding, but manageable at lower speeds. I have used this during my bike rides. The ear buds sit firmly in ear and I haven't faced any issue. There are three sizes in the pack, so you can choose the ideal size.  The voice command works fine as well"
Good budget Bluetooth headphones,4.0,"Sound quality is as you expect from this price, bass is heavy which some might like, build is good and looks durable, there‚Äôs no noise cancellation for sure and you can‚Äôt expect that at this price. Connects easily to any device and you can connect 2 devices simultaneously"
Good product at this price range,5.0,Review after 10 days use.. the product is great at this cost .The packaging from the seller was not good at all.. it seemed like it was a used product but luckily it was not...Sound Quality is GoodNoise cancellation is above AverageAnd for bass lovers this is your cup of tea ..Amazing.. Bass.Thank You Amazon for serving us in this pandemic Situations too...
Overpriced and not a durable product,1.0,Purchased in April 19 and after after 6 mths product isn't working. Initially the product performance was good like Bluetooth connectivity and  battery life but after 6 mths connection failure is frequent and finally no sound in both the earphones. My view at this point is product is overpriced and not that durable. Let's see what response I will be getting at service center as it's still under warranty.
Pathetic design and performance,1.0,"Cons:~ Quality of plastic is cheap for the price.~ Cable that goes around the neck is very stiff and uncomfortable to wear.~ Ear bud rubber is slippery and even the bud with does not fit properly.~ Multifunction buttons provided in the right side tag is hard to press does not provide proper haptic feedback.~ Length of the cable is longer than the required size and makes sure that the mic stays away from your mouth so that during calls people can hardly hear you.~ -200% noise cancellation, when you are on a call, the receiver can hear the noise of a motorcycle that is 1km away from you. It actually absorbs the noise better than the users voice.~ For multifunction keys dedicated to power on/off, toggle previous/next and to enable Google assistant, the time defined for long press is so long that it's frustrating everytime when you want to turn off your device.Pros:* Good sound quality* Voiceover feedback on key press actions are highly intuitive."
Bass is above average.,4.0,Sound quality is great in this price range. Built in plastuic. Looks a little fragile but does the job in Rs. 999. You need to take a little care of them. Fitting in ear is a little problem in initial days but your ears will adjust with it. Bass is above average which is rare in bluetooth earphones.
"Very Noisy and BASS is not good, it is almost like LOUD SPEAKER",2.0,"My review after using it for a 20 mins. My ears are paining... Its not BASS actually, its like DJ LOUD SPEAKER... As I'm using of Sony Extra-bass wired headset and Apple, this is nothing compared to them. Just for the sake of Wireless headset, you can ahead. I didn't checked call clarity on it."
Rockerz rock but customer support poor,4.0,It's one of the best! I used it around 1.5 years. But recently there is lose contact in wire due to which I don't hear anything from the ear buds. Looks like a easy fix but there are no service centers around. There is just one which is unreachable and also the mail id on boAt website is unreachable. Customer support must be improved but I guess that doesn't bring much revenue for them so that area has been neglected
This is a SUB Woofer.......wow,5.0,"Wow......i say, just BOOM boom....Bass......just awesome......DEEP bast is very very good....I used jbl bt160 which cost 2200rs...But this is worth buying....at Amazon in just 899rs....What a sound yaar...paisa vasul....Battery backup also nice......i recommended for this"
Mic doesn't work,1.0,"the design, look, sound quality, bass are all finebut the biggest drawback is when you are on a call or you are recording your voice.The mic is like a mystery it is able to record even the slightest of noise from the environment but your voice won't be recorded. The other person on the call keeps complaining this that all sorts of voices are audible except for the user.Even I tested it by recording my voice and I was amazed to see that what it recorded was birds chirping and rainfall but not a single word from my mouth.1 star for its hell like irritating mic."
Value for money,4.0,"I just brought it in last week, and to be very frank,it's really Awesome. Beyond my expectations.Sound quality is like having your own personal home theatre,too clear and loud enough, you can listen every single bit of music.And coming to battery backup, they said it's 6hrs but it's more than that, for me it's working near about one and more."
Comfortable ...But Bass not there ...!!,4.0,I have purchased these headphones for my brother and he is currently using it but when I used these earphones I found that the bass is not that much good it is ok ok for listening songs on the go but if you are expecting something very powerful or something appreciable it is not in that League although it is quite comfortable to wear but you have to compromise the quality of song with the comfort..... that's what I feel.... show my birth date is if you want to have a comfort of wearing light earphones or headphones then it is a good bye but if you wish to have something good for listening to I would not suggest it !!
Good for music player not for calling,3.0,Sound quality for songs/movies is really good but when it comes to call then mic doesn't perform well. Along with main voice background noise also get added and caller from another end hear alomost any sound/noise even when it too low in real scenario. Battery performance is good and charging time too is moderate.
Worth for money product,5.0,Easy to carry. Gud material quality. Charge back up comes for a week of 4h/day continuous playing. Its taking shorter time for full charge. Gud quality which using for call. Base quality is not that much gud bt its worth for budget. I ll surely recommend dis product if u use it for light music and call purpose. Worth for money
Missing Magnetic Connect,4.0,"Pro's:Build & Sound qualityCon's:* Missing Magnetic Connect/disconnect* Volume controls should have integrated in band, but given seperately is kinda uncomfortable* Band is very big compared to image* Actual Color differs from image"
One side of the headphones got damaged,1.0,"If you are looking for headphones for short term use, this one looks perfect. But I can assure you that this product won't last more than 6 months. My headphones got it's both sides damaged with in first 4 months of use and I asked for a replacement. Yes, they gave another headphones as replacement and after another 8 months the replaced headphones again got damaged. Since the warranty period is over by  1 month I'm unable to claim the warranty. Think wisely before selecting these sub standard products."
Nice product.. very decent,4.0,The sound quality is really good.. bass is also good.. but the only problem is with the manufacturing.. The earphones are MADE IN CHINA..But other wise really impressed.. good.. must buy.. affordable price.. thanks amazon.. good...
Unreliable battery less than 60%. Switches off anytime.,2.0,Battery performance has nose dived just after a year. It keeps showing 40% battery but switches off. It's become unreliable to use it if battery is less than 60%. Switches off anytime.
A good product overall.,4.0,"Its a great product in the 1000/- segment (bought in offer).Over 10 pieces bought in my circle.Comfortable, durable, long battery, fits.Over all a Good product.32 hrs of battery with single device.With Multiple device around 18 hrsLitte drop in voice Quality while connected via Skype and microsoft teams"
connectivity is poor.value for money,1.0,after 6 months one ear buds damage1.Noise cancellation is good.2.connectivity is poor when i call sometimes its sound is broken.bluetooth 4.2 is outdated its not work in havy wireless noise area i prefer blt 5.0. for room is good3.Price is value for money i got it ‚Çπ899 in bbd.4.This price range sound quality is good but not aowsem because i used before boat 220 wired (‚Çπ500) its base is better than it.
Very good and satisfied.,5.0,"Using it since 1 year and they are very good for the price Rs.999. No issues so far regarding quality, connectivity and earpieces. Very much satisfactory. Bass is also good, right quantity of what a good music lover would expect."
Worst product ever bought from Boat,1.0,"Within 2 months,1. Sound quality was bad2. No noise cancellation3. stopped at min battery of 30 percent.4. Battery last for only 4 hr after 100 percent.When repaired under warranty, the product now is in more bad state.In all, this product is waste of time and money."
Review after 1 year,4.0,"Reviewing it after more than 1 year :No doubt sound quality at this range is best, but few cons - first noise cancellation is very bad, second battery sucks after 1-2 months of usage, third you cannot use it for more than 2 hours and fourth no matter how much you keep it with care one side no-sound issue will arise within 7-8 months but (don't worry thanks to the replacement policy)Overall ,if you are not going to use earphones to attend calls while travelling, this is the best available wireless earphone at this price range."
No customer support against warranty claim .,4.0,"After 8 months  , one of the earphone stopped working I contacted the manufacturer Boat to repair or replace the the item as it got defect within warranty period . They arranged pickup from courier xpressbees , and and now for the last one month I'm waiting for the item , there is no clue where that has gone ."
Value for money,5.0,"The sound quality, noise cancellation, bass,...etc., everything is fine and fair with the price.If I have to speak about my product, I treated it in such a manner that if it is a living thing it will commit suicide instead of being with me.The item's rigid assembling and toughness of wires impressed me. Six months back I bought this product, even now it's working cool.If you're a rough fella I advise you to go with this.The perfect one with a reasonable price."
Worst customer service ! Hate it!,1.0,Earphones are fine but the customer service of boat company is worse .buy at ur own risk .No help will be provided and for that i hate this product.if i cud i woudnt evn hav given 1 star.
Just Ok,5.0,Very nice product. Sound quality is Excellent. Bass is awesome. Battery backup nice but not long time. CONNECTING Average .

Worst in terms of Sound Quality. For music go with Sony CI200,1.0,"I ordered 2, one was this 255pro and another was of Sony CI200. In terms of sound quality Sony is far better crisp and Clear. BOat 255pro is better in build quality nuts not meant for music listeners. So if your purpose is enjoying music go with any other brand. In other words Boat is a brand hyped by advertising making use of screen celebrities."
Broken earphones delivered twice,1.0,This is pathetic approach by Amazon twice delivered broken Bluetooth earphones. If Amazon want to hire cheap Vendors to delivered roadside items to valued customers then it is difficult to survive in the market. I will make sure I will not ordere anything afterwards from amazon.Always check the dealer Tech fire is not a genuine sellers he sells such kind of damaged articles
Just the perfect earphone you need for everyday !!,4.0,"Actually a product worth buying.. I have mostly been a fan of quality products than brand names.. Boat has come up with a product that does just everything it is supposed to do.. I got it for under 1k on one of the sale days and that's why it's even more of a satisfying buy.. my views on this after using my Boat Rockers for almost over a month extensively..1. Sound is quite good..bass is quite good for regular use (I mostly listen to Psychedelic, Techno and Rock, performs genuinely on all the genres)2. Lightweight - I have slept wearing it twice, never realised..!!3. Good battery life- goes on easily for 6-7 hours with one charge..(mix of usage and standby)4. Love the color- I have a red and black colour one..looks super classy..5.noise cancellation is good. Blocks out pretty much all of the ambient sound even in the middle of noisy surroundings..All in all..I am happy I waited a long time to buy a genuine wireless earphone and Boat Rockers made it worth the wait..Cheers team Boat..!!"
Good product,4.0,Good product but I would have rather gone for an earphone with better battery storage. Gets charged easily. Gets charge dissipiated easily.Otherwise good quality product. Convient use.
Very bad,1.0,Bluetooth connectivity issues always i need boat company is not doing properly QA testing . All boat product is used to damaged very soon and thay dont have service centre as well on Bangalore
Best headset [ BoAt Rockerz 255 ],5.0,"This is a very good headset. I have purchased it 20 days ago. It can be paired with Mobile, Laptop, etc. It is Bluetooth version 4.0. If we charge it for 10 minutes then it will work for 45 minutes which is great for online classes. While listening music, it's great. Sound Quality, Bass Quality, Noice Cancellation are great."
Do not Buy any boat product..!!!,1.0,"I am being very honest here, the product might be very decent but the poor quality and durability. within 6 months of usage it stopped working. Raised complaint for the product replacement and its been 2 months but no response from them. I though i was the only one facing such issue m but when i went to their twitter page i saw people waiting for replacement for more than 3- 4 months.You can go and check on their twitter page and see how bad the after sales service is.I Hope Amazon stop selling their product as they are very bad with their services."
Just good not a great.,2.0,"No doubt , it's long last till 5.5 hours... And charge very fast in an hour . But the thing is it's inbuilt quality is not so much good. Mine right ear peice got stop working in one and half month only. May be due to problem in my earphone set. But the bass is too high and the treble is quite low it can't be used for daily hearing it's a good for calling but the mic is in left string , so it must as much near to Ur mouth other wise other person next to phone can't hear Ur voice. And remember it's a not good daily . I loved its battery and charging and I would  rate 6/10 for music , 8/10 for charging , 9/10 for bass , 10/10 for battery backup , 5/10 for treble , 7/10 for calling , its my review after using it for a quite one and a half month"
Not worth the price,1.0,"Bought this for 1999. I was hoping this would be better than the Chkoko earphones I owned. Build quality is flimsy, but I wasn't expecting any better for the price. The Bluetooth connection was smooth, but the range is that for 10 feet.  Expect that to drop significantly if you walk out of the room or if there is a wall in between. Didn't fit into my ear very well and felt uncomfortable.Was surprised by the distorted sound quality. I am not an audiophile but these earphones don't do justice oo higher volumes and on call mic operations. Would not recommend. Returned."
Buy if battery is priority.,5.0,"Battery - 5+/5Bass - 3/5Noise Canc - 4/5If you are not a music lover, use it for education, movies, calls, meetings with bestest battery backup - then this is for you. Impressed with the battery backup."
Exelent Value for money,4.0,It's a very good product.... Just don't wear it in rain because the earphones miggt be water or sweat resistant but battery and chipset is not that much....besides that its a great earphone..you can recive calls handlessly and play pubg without wires comming outta your phone...plus in the gym you can keep you phone aside during workouts and enjoy music ....and you can change songs...volume ... Redial ...pause/play using the buttons given...overall a handsfree experience with superb sound quality and the eargrippers do their jobs as well...
After 1month one side of headset is not working,1.0,"only using for 1 month one side of headset is not working, again I submitted a request at boat site for replacement and it takes 20-30days its waste of time to buy and return the product."
Battery Indication Is Worst.,3.0,"Writing this review after using 2 weeks.Overall it's an average product, not too good not too bad.Battery backup was also not satisfactory but not too bad at the same time. I have only one issue with the battery indication. It was showing 100% then 80% and then directly down to 20% and off. There's no in between. Boat should take a look for this problem.Sound quality, noise cancelation were above average, Satisfied for this criteria. Bluetooth connectivity is good can be more better.Overall this is a good product."
boAt Rockerz 255 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic (Active Black),1.0,boAt Rockerz 255 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic (Active Black)  ` is not  switching on . Please replace it with a new piece as it is still under warranty.  I had bought it on 16th July 2021
Worth it! Classic Boat product.,5.0,"It's a classic boat product, good noise cancellation, clear sound quality. I mainly use it to conduct online-offline hybrid classes, and the performance has been exceptional."
Awesome quality product!!,5.0,"Very clear and crisp sound. Bass is amazing.overall a very nice quality earphone at this price range of 899,somehow the earcord are a bit longer which is a little drawbacks, but anyways we can't do anything because it's a company manufacturing style. Thanks amazon and boat."
"Good sound, average battery life.",4.0,"I have used Boult earlier and now this one.Sound quality is definitely better, however the battery life is on lower side.. continuous use of 4-5 hours will drain it, volume levels are lower too.Good for listening music and watching videos, performance is not upto mark for voice/video calls .. lacks the clarity.Nevertheless; for the price, it is its a good buy depending upon your usage patttern."
Awesome product.,5.0,Sound quality is very good with good bass. Its works great when comes to noice cancellation. I've tried it at 70km speed on heavy traffic area works great without any signal drops. Shows battery percentage of bluetooth. V.nice product for this price when compared to Sony products as I almost tried all sony product which doesn't support noice cancellation even after investing 6000 on bluetooth.
Bad experience and zero tolerance,1.0,"After 6 month it is not working. After visiting boat style website and register complain, I received ticket no and pick up number but when trying to track using the link provided no details found. After 1 month I got a person mob no through sms from boat like call him and guide him about your address and handover the item but calling 100 times he didn't received my call at all. No response from boat customer also. Now its been 3 month before complain register, I am writing bad experience which I had with them and swear that no purchase in future from boat. Also informed every freind not to waste money if service is not good."
Nice sound quality and build quality,5.0,Best product I am using from 1 year but it still work excellent. I took in rain but sound is not change. It is work as new up to now. Best build quality. As per my experience with Amazon with this product so I suggest you can buy this. When I use this product other out side Noice not disturbing me I feel music world. This is realy saving of money
Not that great,2.0,"I have used Boat before these however have not been that great , battery life is very short .The sound feels okay (i think). Given the price you can go for other earphones . But honestly the battery is something that is a major factor in not liking them as much I did the other Boat earphones . It is sometimes even difficult to connect them to 2 devices at the same time.In a nut shell , go buy other earphones."
Awesome sound quality at this price segment,5.0,"Sound quality is awesome in the price segment, you can call boat brand as budget friendly JBL/Sony. Noise cancellation is not so great but works well for the price tag, bass is the best part of the earphone, go for it"
A sturdy Bluetooth Neckband  in an affordable price range.,5.0,"I use this Bluetooth Neckband to connect to my Laptop, IPad, Mobile phone.  It works equally well with all of these.Battery life of the product is decent.Bought this in a lightning deal on Amazon.  Its worth the price."
Defective product not connecting,1.0,"Today 27 July 2021 I bought this Boat rockerz bluetooth headset which is defective. I tried everything on Google to connect it, reset my phone too but this piece is defective & it's not connecting to my phone.I ordered a replacement since it's non returnable. I'll post updated review of next headset they will give me."
More over average,4.0,"Good product using approx from 20 days.Battery is super.Looks good.Magnets is also good.But, mic is not at the mark.Noise cancellation is not good.The one we are talking with will always complaint about the environmental noise."
Very worse customer service and cannot claim my warranty.,1.0,The customer care is worse they ask you to generate ticket and their customer care number is always busy.The product stopped working after 6 months in around May it's August now I am tired yet my product is not yet repaired.This is disgusting good luck with your useless customer services.
Best product i have ever seen....,5.0,I think this is the best product i am buying on Amazon.in really its battery backup  its about 2 day of continuing use still 60% battery i have.. only one mistake i noticed that only earbuds i think more efforts can be done on earbuds soo ear gets more comfort other than these i think the value of money of this product is great i am totally satisfied with these product.. And also i noticed that Amazon is trusted site for buying products than other sites thank you Amazon for such deal like these product...lastly ratingsBattery backup - 10/10Sound clearty -10/10Noice cancellation - 10/10Volume- 10/09Earbuds - 10/07Other than these i think all off these 10/10 its great product by boat thank you...
Good product at this price but interference with wifi,3.0,"The product is good.Only issue, it has interference while attending calls , the mobile wifi access fails to work.Same issue while attending audio conference from laptop."
Don‚Äôt waste ur money on this product,1.0,"I have just bought this Headphones 1 month back for my brother online class , it‚Äôs totally waste , I thought it‚Äôs affordable and good , one side of headphone is not working and the button removes itself and makes us uncomfortable, plz don‚Äôt buy this product by brother is suffering a lot now as becoz of this Headphones. If u want a good quality headphones don‚Äôt buy this as it‚Äôs affordable , if u want to invest on some good headphones this is not the correct product and u can put some extra money and buy a Nice wireless headphones"
Doesn‚Äôt get connect in both devices automatically,4.0,"I have paired it with my laptop and mobile. But when I carry the set out of Bluetooth coverage of laptop or mobile and again come back in Bluetooth coverage area, it doesn‚Äôt get connected automatically."
Don't fall for the false advertising,1.0,Bass - doesn't existNoise cancellation - just makes your voice louderFalse advertising - the website and Amazon page says it supports Apt X but it does not. It only has the option for SBC and AAC.Try searching on the internet about this specific model if you don't believe me. I only found out after receiving the package so now I can't even return it as the seller only offers replacement and no returns.
bass is very good,4.0,"i like the music quality but built quality is not good i will say built quality is average.I don't know why Black boat 255 pro plus is costly than all other varients,I will love to know.but talking about all it is a good earphone but it can be better by reducing providing a better built quality.#Boat #BoatRockerz #boatindia #Amazonindia"
Ok ok .... compared to others and cost it's ok to buy,3.0,Wire length is large need to reduce it . And u can't find case to keep it.so Don't forgot to keep box with you.you are able to.listen very small sound.also louder in call l. Some times.while listening songs by keeping phone in pocket and moving sound getting distrurbed. My first one is not able to connect two devices at a time. After exchange I got right one .but still needs some improvements
Nice earphones,5.0,"PROSmaterial quality is GOOD.sound quality is great.Durable Enough.earpieces are good. Earpieces Fit properly in ears.The microphone works fine.Bluetooth connectivity is Good. Connects with both PC and MOBILE very easily.Voice Acknowledgements are great in this Earphone. ( for  switch ON,  Switch OFF  &  Connectivity)There is a small light Indicator on the Earphone that works fine.We can charge the Earphone through adaptor or USB.CONSAs it is a Bluetooth Earphone, therefore, it works great within a certain range. Try not to go too far from your Device(Mobile  or PC )While Commuting If the volume is too high, The earphone cancels all the noise around us. This can be dangerous.Overall this product is great  . Whether you are using it for Voice or Video calls or listening to music (soft or high bass) or listening to any video lecture."
Value for money,4.0,The product is quite decent for the price and is very convenient to use. It's Bluetoothconnectivity is limited to a few meters after which it gets automatically disconnected. It lasts for about 5 to 6 hours  but u need to turn off the headphone manually and it is not automatically turned off like the MI headphone when u stick the magnetic headphone together.
Good headphone in this range but sound quality not up to mark,3.0,"I have got this for rs.1419/- and for this range for the wireless headphone it is a good deal, sound is ok and comfortable to use, it did not fall from ear, as there is some locking type of thing, which holds the earpiece in it's place, nice product. It may feel this way because i used to airpod from apple."
Disappointed after 9 months,3.0,It was working fine till last week but suddenly right-side earpiece stopped working after 9 months of normal use. As it was in warranty I have returned it to the Boat service center and waiting for replacement or repair. I will update my review after the repair or replacement.
"THE DEALER HAS NOT PROVIDED A INVOICE , caution , product not durable",1.0,"now my boat rocker is not working .... tried to apply for a warrenty as its well within the warrenty period , but on searching for the invoice i found that it was never delivered to me at all .... without which u cant apply for a replacmet or a repair ..........BE CAREFUL REGARDNG THIS .....Also customer care centers are present only in a hand full of places ......so IT IS A BAD CHOICE IF UR ARE LOOKING FOR A DURABLE PRODUCT ....It worked for ONLY 11 MONTHS .....that too with minimal use !!!!!!"
Amazing for this price range,5.0,"Earlier I had 255 in which one side stopped working after 1.5 years so I bought this one and I can say it is providing the exactly same sound quality with far amazing battery. I haven't charged it since it arrived and still the battery percentage it shows 95, overall i may have used it around 20 hrs total (haven't counted actually) but battery is really great.Go for it around 1000‚Çπ, everything else is good also."
Very poor product d9nt buy this.,1.0,Product is worse don't buy this. Within 4 month it creates problem during call. Sometimes ear plugs are not working properly.. after few months suddenly the sound disappeared.. so I clam in warrenty period but ita about to 1 month. There is not any mail or call comes from boat that your product is dispatch on not..Everything is so poor..I don't recommend anyone for boat..Poor very poor.
Nice buy under 1000,4.0,"I got this for 900 in sale...so its a good buy at this rate.But i ordered Boult pro bass at same rate on another site coz i wanted to compare both n then decide.I found out that sound quality is good in both but main problem comes during the call....mic sound problem...the other person complains for for low voice.I chose Boult one coz that was a bit better than this boat 255....sound,mic,connectivity n all!Other features are same as mentioned...like magnetic earbuds, nice shaped neckband,tangle free cord, nice battery, etcHowever, noise cancellation and bass quality is not so good...its average!"
Just ok product,2.0,After looking ratings I bought this but I didn't like it...not so comfortable in ear n feels heavy around neck. They should have given small medium large size ear clips similar to ear plugs.Ear clip given with this product is bigger for me..after usage I could feel bit pain in my ear lobe.
Good Sound Good Bass. Poor noise cancellation.,3.0,"1. Sound and bass quality is good as compared to the other products (At this price point)2. Noise cancellation is extremely weak. Even those unbranded cheap wired earphones offer way better noice cancellation.3. Device can be used effectively only upto 20% battery mark. After that, the device will start beeping and will automatically shut down shortly. So try not to use the device unless and untill it becomes extremely important after <20% battery level."
Not worth buying it,1.0,"Purchased boAt Rockerz 255 Sports ear phones on 29th March2019. Stopped working in 3 days. Had to replace it.Now it's been 3 months and it stopped working completely.Very bad product. What's the use, when u pay so much and cannot use it even for a year."
Answer frequently asked questions only if sure as creating wrong image of product,5.0,As per frequently asked questions bluthooth goes off when connect via magnet however thats not case it just go on standby mode rest however this feature no where mention by company in their feature list so answer questions if only sure rest product is amazing in this price range. Amazing sound and battery life.
Troubling is painfull on 100% sound,3.0,"I like this product bettery life but after 20% bettery this nackband automatically turn off then i am not use this product properly, this are most problem afterall  big betterylife. Noise cencellation are not workout properly, noise cencellation working evrage level like 20 to 30% and build quality is normal but this is not a big problem, i am disappointed on after 20% bettery this is automatically turn off this is irritating meee ü§¨......."
Average sound. Not durable.,2.0,"These aren't durable. And I've not taken them for running or support activities. Just average indoor and outdoor use. No matter what you do, this earphone won't survive more than almost an year. You'll need to buy another one next year 100% sound quality is also not so great for what you'd pay for. I would now either pay for better quality earphone which will survive longer or buy cheaper ones, replacing which every year will not cost me as much. Makes no sense to but this earphone"
Received fake item,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I am totally disappointed as I HAVE RECIRVED A FAKE PRODUCT!! i was not working even after charging for more than 1 hour.... Amazon please make sure that the seller is sending the genuine product.... Because the publicity of amazon prime sale you r doing is at very large scale and this is what we are getting in our hands. üòî"
Worst experience,3.0,I was not at all satisfied with the boats premium product.1-it was to heavy always feels on running2- poor battery life with poor indications3-after 20% life auto disconnect and does not get connect again4- while running or jogging it's connection get lost5-To much sound disturbance.6- no use sound cancellation feature.7- Audio quality is ok8-Call quality is also ok but not clear get broke in between.Overall only one good thing is sound rest is over priced
Save up and go for a better option,1.0,I am not very impressed. I bought a new pair because of the hype people were giving for boat products. Its very much bass focused and that's what you would like about it. My 840rs sony ex 155 does a great job than this. Its Bluetooth latency is too bad and the range is extremely poor. I own a wh 1000 xm3 but its not a comparable product. Even though i am saying compared to its lattency its too bad. And i don't know how durable it is. In my oneplus 7 pro even after turning on dolby its sound is not upto the mark. After these days of use the mic is not working. I am expecting a refund
Good product but bluetooth connectivity needs improvement,4.0,"It's been couple of months since I purchased this headphones. The quality of sound is good. A competitive product at this price range. However I see few niggles in the Bluetooth connectivity. When songs keep streaming from mobile device continuously, there is slight interruptions in between breaking the seamless play.. The interruptions are more frequent when you touch the mobile device by hand"
Not recommended,1.0,It has been 7 days since I have purchased this earphone. Sound quality is good. But while you are in call the other person cannot hear you clearly. Initially I thought it was due to network issue but while removing the earphone the call was pretty clear. Even I was getting the voice too late. Not recommended for calling purpose. Before this I had used two earphone from boat bassHeads 225 and performance was very good. This time I am very disappointed with the product.
Defective Product Battery doesn't Charge,1.0,"Hello I have received this earphone on Saturday 31/07/21, sound quality is good but after discharge of battery doesn't take  charge even a few second after kepping it more than two hours of charging, but indicator showing red light .i just want to apply for Return . üòîüëé"
Not reliable / durable,2.0,"I purchased it couple of months back. Let me be very honest and straight forwardPros1.Nice design , light weight2.Decent battery lifeCons1. Not reliable / durable as after almost 7-8 months of usage suddenly it died ( not able to charge / use )2. Bass and sound quality is average3. Not able to attend phone calls on iOS devices ( over bluetooth )"
Worth the 799 offer price,4.0,Everything i've experienced till now (1 week) is quiet 'satisfying'.Matte finish on the buttons and Battery is so premiumOnly 2 problems I felt was :1. The left earphone plug out (slip out) of my ear very often. I don't know why but that is what it is.2. The Cable length is a bit long so it feel Clumsy more often than not. (THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LENGTH ADJUSTER).THANKS FOR READING...ü§ó
Overall a good budget headphone,4.0,"I purchased it after returning one basic sports bluetooth headphone.(Not sure if I mention the brand) , it would violate Amazon's policies. Overall it is very good , and only rant is sound quality. Sound quality is average. Battery life is good . No significant sound drops.  I got it at 999 /- which was a deal to steal."
Big no to this product,1.0,What a waste product. There is no concept of noise cancellation except your voice each n every outsider sound u can hear in this headphone. The main purpose to buy this product is to avoid that helmet m phone fasa k phone pe baat krna but guess what when u use this headphone while driving u can hear only altu faltu sound but not that person voice. Infact it hurts your ears too when your wear helmet over this. Seriously after using 2 to 3 months I am writing this review and it really sucks. I am a boat lover person but this product seriously disappointed me alot.
The seller is not gud,2.0,Jst fed up with the seller..1st they sent the product which only wrked for 2 days efficiently then i exchanged it n the product i received now is having conectivity poblm..it only connects for audio not for calls..3/10 times only it connects for both..
Value for money,5.0,I have used this product for a week. First review of this product I must say is good battery life and awesome sound quality. I have used this headphone for making average phone calls and listen music for an hr or 2 per day and battery lasts fir 2 days. Also watch 2 movies continuously by single charge. It also connects with my smart TV.
Earbuds are hard. Not very comfortable to wear and causes pain,3.0,"Sound quality is average.The magnet is not very strong to keep both earpieces together. It comes out easily.I have used realme wireless bluetooth earlier and felt it wasMuch betterAlso one has to specifically switch on and off. Again, realme used to do that automatically (based on the fact if both ear pieces are joined to each other or not)"
This has inbuilt RJ voice,2.0,"There earphones are good, have good sound quality but when it turn on , connects to anything and when battery is low THIS EARPHONE IS GOING TO SHOUT IN YOUR EARS WITH MAX VOLUME WITH ANNOYING RJ VOICE .Hope this helps you"
Don't buy this product. Buy that rockerz 255F.,1.0,I am giving this review after using 5 days.When i am connecting this bluetooth in laptop and mobile at the same time after few minutes its automatically disconnected from the phone.While i am putting it on the charging the left part is heating too much.When i have charged at full time the maximum 5hours playback not more than it.Its not better than that boat rocckerz 255F.Range is for this bluetooth is only 3-4Meter not more than it.West of money. Don't buy this item.
"Quality ok ok, battery life is banchmark to others",4.0,"First sounds quality is 3.7/5Plastic quality is luks avg product 3/5 (premium look expected tha but hai nahi)The only you can buy this for its battery,Khatam nahi hoti hai....For battery 5/5Still itne Paisa me itna hi milega so you can go with it.."
BUY IT ONLY IF WANT IT FOR LESS THAN AN YEAR WITH ONLY ONE EARPHONE WORKING,3.0,"Good product but after 10 months one earphone stopped working and visited the service center twice and dint feeling like waiting in such long queues in such conditions. Thus could not claim the warranty also sent them mail but no response, yet as of now warranty done and ended up with single speaker working"
Amazing battery and charging!,5.0,"Amazing fast charging. If you're not listening to music all the time, just let it be connected, receive calls when necessary, the battery will last all day.Amazing and loud sound.Not much bass.Not much comfortable in ears, but the band is good.Overall a very good purchase."
Could be better!,3.0,"Bass and treble are unbalanced, there is much bass compared to treble. Product is good for extra bassheads. Battery backup is good. Build quality is great.Comparing it with ant audio wave sports 540, ant audio clearly wins, i would suggest u to buy ant audio in the same price segment (If u like balanced music bass=treble) ant audio is a perfect choice.+Points of boatBetter grip in ear, hooks don't hurtTurns off automatically when not connected.Flat wires+ Points of ant audioBluetooth 5.0Bass and treble are perfectly balancedBattery backup is better than boat (around 1.5 hours extra)Calling quality is great"
Great product but Quality and Support is Pathetic,1.0,"I bought the 255 Pro in August but it went bad on the right ear - this was in 15th Oct less than an month since purchase. I raised a ticket and the it was promptly picked up on 16th Oct 2020. But till now i have no status on this as it was sent to Mumbai. The call centers are not reachable as well. I think i may even have lost the product. So while the product was great, its quality was pretty poor and the Support is almost non-existant."
Good Product: Value for Money,4.0,"I order this product in Amazon 4th Oct 21 Sale. It is too early to write review but I felt satisfied when I used this product first time. Very good Bluetooth range, good bass in this price surprising. Decent battery back up. ( Can be more ) but ok for this price. Good sound quality and good build quality not fragile. Value for Money. I will again write review after use of couple of months. Thanks!"
Sound quality is nice.,4.0,"Overall a great product. Sound quality is great in mids. Buttons are tactile enough. Altho the charging port is micro USB which could be Type-C, as some products provide it in this price range. Wires could be a bit shorter, Also, the cover on the charging port is a bit tricky to open, feels like I would break it if didn't pay attention while opening it but that's just nitpicking."
Product received in a tampered condition,1.0,"Product received in a tampered condition and charging cable is not as per company packaging and replaced with other type (not c type), product is not fresh seems refurbished or used. Cardboard packaging is fine but product package is tampered and resealed post changing the parts. Worst experience over a diwali gift product. Need fresh replacement at the earliest."
6 months,1.0,"I bought boat 255 rockerz in December 2018 and it's got non functional in 6 months flat, then I got it replaced and the replacement also got non functional again in 6 months period. So my experience with this earphone says this is product is good for 6 month only. Buy with care."
Not worth it.,1.0,"No this time boat did not satisfied because product quality is just okay okay but the main purpose, sound clarity is really very worst so i will suggest Realme buds is the best one to people who are reading this comment so better go on that.Thank you guys."
Too bad for calling outside bedroom  even in balcony.,4.0,Overall good. No problem for audio/ video for user. Bad for calls. Mic is more sensitive to background noise than user voice. Hence person on the other end hears too much of background noise more than what is heard from normal phone mic.
Zero noise cancellation,2.0,"Zero noise cancellation...other end person can hear background people/noise louder than you and really disturbing to whom you‚Äôre speaking with avoid using for calling. Sound quality is not that good, it‚Äôs ok ok. Bluetooth connectivity and battery life is good."
"Good product, value for money",4.0,Two weeks over.. Battery back up is good. Sound quality is good for the price.. Soft buds for ears. Only drawback for Bluetooth based headphones is FM listening is not possible as antenna plug in is not there. Need to use online FM..
Great for this price range but slightly could have been better,5.0,"I purchased this headset for 1500 and after using for 2 days,this is what I feltPros:1. Terrific Noise cancellation2. Sweat proof(Justified it's IP rating)3. Awesome Battery life( More than 7 hrs for me  as I was using medium volume just for a 1.5  hr charge)4. Premium sound quality while listening to  musicCons:1. Bluetooth Range, (although they mentioned  it to be 10 m), was very less, around 7 m.2. Conical buds ( removable)3. Voice call quality was not as expected"
Above Average experience at an affordable price,4.0,"Pros:- Amazing product for a price of 999/-  with 1 year warranty- The bass is better than existing bluetooth earphones in the market- The sound quality of it is good and accesible for daily runs- It is splashproof so you can use it anywhere and good for gyms tooCons:- Bluetooth 4.2, could have been Bluetooth 5.0!- Sound quality and noise isolation could have been better- Takes around 1.5 hrs to charge everytime it powers out- The fit is not as good as compared to other bluetooth earphones in  the segment but you will get used to itBut overall the performace is above average and battery backup is around 5 hrs at 85% volume and will get you through the day."
Good bass and quality sound...,4.0,"After using about two months iam writing this review.As a hundred rupees earphone user for long time,First time i bought this boAt bluetooth earphone.Initially i had a very big hesitation to buy this earphone because of its price is about 1699.but later Waiting for a month i got this in 'lightening deal' for Rs.999 with including some cashback offers.Pros: =>Good sound quality,a very good bass,=>good battery backup(really it plays upto 45mins with10mins charging)=>Fits perfectly to my ears(various sizes of extra buds added)=>light weightcons: No cons for sound quality,but i feel that Wires are bit lengthy(but i compromised for bass and sound quality)Finally kudukara kaasuku worthu!!"
Boat sails in every aspect but sinks in what is meant to do.,3.0,"The way this product has swept the market is spectacular.Pros: No wonder it is a thoughful asset; its built quality is decent, fits in your ears quite well, isn't uncomfortable and it is cheaper than its competitions.It has a good bluetooth connectivity. The light weight of this earphone makes it comfortable to wear it for long hours.Cons: The only and the biggest issue with this product is that the mouth piece is placed on the outside and because of which the listener on the other end hears almost everything but the talker. There is way too much noise because if this. It would have been better if the mic was placed in the inside. This way Boat would have been undisputably 'The Best' earphones in the market at this price!"
"Useless, waste of money don't buy",1.0,A poor quality product. One of the worst earphone I have ever used. Didn't expect this from boat. Neither the sound quality nor bass is any good. It's like a cheap headphone one can buy on any traffic signal. Unluckily for me there is only replacement option and no returns and I would get the same product back. The ear buds keep falling off even after multiple adjustments. Complete waste of money
Earbuds are problamatic,2.0,The earbuds are getting removed themselves every time. It's a rather irritating experience with this product. Sound quality and battery life is pretty good but this thing is really annoying.
Facing Issue With Boat Rockerrz 255 Csk Edition,1.0,"Dear Team,I have Facing Lot of Problems With This Products After 10 Days.When I am Using This Boat Rockerrz 255 CSK Edition Bluetooth unable to Speak On call When Bluetooth is Connected And Also Facing This Issue When I am Listening Music Or Watching Videos With Boat Rockerrz 255 He Is Disconnected between Playing time.Request To You Kindly Do Needful Please Return Or Exchange This Product..."
Good,3.0,"The sound quality is good, No connectivity issues as well. connects swiftly to phone. One of the major issue is the noise cancellation, often on calls people tell me that there is lot of noise around. this is the major flaw with this.Unless u are in a quiet place else its good."
One side ear phone not working properly,3.0,Ergonomics wise it was good. I was not regular user. But using it for 2 years one side of ear phone was not working properly. sound used stop intermittently. looks like there was loose connectivity internally.
Bass is bad. frequent disconnections,2.0,ProsSound quality is good.build quality is goodConsPoor bass.Buds coming out easily. didn't fit into my ears.Frequent disconnections makes your listening horrible
Good but OnePlus is best‚úåÔ∏è,3.0,To my amaze you have too switch off bluetooth to disconnect neckband...yes it's true then why you put magnet in it...and some times it looses connectivity too. Overall it's ok to buy if you have patience more than meüòÇ. Battery backup is awesome by the way..
Keep Playing.....Keep Going...Must buy..,4.0,"Sound quality is good. Bass quality is good but not for base lovers. Bluetooth range is v.good. Noise cancellation in ears is very good but while calling, it catches little background noise , and sometimes voice of other person mumbles up,  and is not clear but doesnt make much difference. Battery backup is around 5-6 hrs with continue play. (To save battery keep ur volume low and not full.)Verdict- it's a good choice. Go for it."
A perfect product,4.0,"It is just  wow product.If you are looking for perfectly balanced bluetooth earphones then Rockerz 255 pro is the one which you should buy.> Sound quality is awesome,>Bass is perfectly balanced,>Connectivity is extra fine,>Noise cancellation is just great.Now about battery after using it for 1 hour continuosly the battery percentage dropped down just by 2%.It is worth it's price.Awesome productüëçüëçüëç"
Not Working After 1 month,2.0,Well well well....I bought it i was really happy and was expecting an amazing quality from boat and yeah it was good just for 1 month..After that it showed up am unable to charge it and yeah because of not getting enough power ofcourse its not working what can i now expect please boat modetator if u saw this review just try to imporve durability of your product...Searching for someone who can help
"Good product, customer care/service questionable",2.0,"I've been using it on runs for the last month and haven't had any issues. Lately however, the earphones have stopped charging, the LED doesn't work and the earphones heat up substantially when I try to charge it.I have tried to register the product and a complaint on the vendor's website but always receive an error. I've tried calling them but the always receive a 'network busy' error. I have emailed them and awaiting a reply.Overall a really good product but if one can't get the product to work during the warranty period, there's no point in buying it."
Good but build product it's not good,4.0,"Product are good. Sound quality and base are too good but Boat service policy is too bad, they are not reverted any mail, msgs, calling and This headphone manufacturing not so good quality. some time there are showing sound problem."
After using 2 months,4.0,"I am using this from 2 months. Sound quality is great for all types of song. Battery backup is not bad, i charge it once in an alternative day. It may be takes 1 to 1.30 hours to full charge. But I think there are little bit problem in mic, when i am in a busy environment, the opposite person always complaining about the noise. I purchased it on 1300, in this budget it is the best one."
Awesome product,4.0,Build quality (5/5)Durability (4/5)Sound quality (5/5)Microphone (4/5)Ear comfort (5/5)This product met my expectations....Thanks Amazon ‚ù§Ô∏è
Bluetooth quality not at all good & very less battery storage,1.0,"Purchased two Earphones, out of which one works good, however the second one has very bad battery storage (Drains out within 1 hr play, secondly the Blue tooth quality is not good, gets disconnected frequently from mobile phones.  I would  to better go for an better quality(expensive) earphone."
Poor quality,2.0,"When I first bought it, was working fine for 2 or 3 months then one side of the earphone was not working properly it was like some loose connection. So I claimed warranty then I got a new one after about 20 days. It's not even one year now since I got the new one, again I'm facing the same issue. One side is not working and If I hold the right side up then its working. I don't know whether they replaced with the new one or They just fixed the issue and gave me the same earphone back."
Pathetic product.... picks up noise of whole world,1.0,"I am using the product for more than one month. Bluetooth connectivity is pretty good, no issue. Battery is fine. Sound quality is just average, nothing special. But the noise cancellation is terrible. You can barely hear properly when you are on a busy road, and the person on the other end would be experiencing the worst voice ever. It picks up and enhances all other external sounds much more than yours.  So guys, please don't go for this product, unless you have enough to waste. You would want to throw it away after a few days, otherwise people would stop talking to you.  I would rate it negative if I could."
Review after one year of usage - Not value for money,2.0,"I am using the product from last one year. initially the product seemed to be good the sound quality, noise cancellation and other things are 6/10. but the quality got deteriorated over time and it stopped working after a year. Boat teams are not responding with the warranty claims. it is not value for money"
Good Sound Quality. No Lag in sound output.,4.0,"1) I have been using this since almost a year.2) Sound quality is decent.3) There is no lag in the sound we hear with the video we watch.4) We can hear the sound upto a maximum of about 10 feet without any walls in between the device and the earphones. There is some disturbance in the sound when we are in a different room with walls in between.5) I have used this with Samsung Smart TV and an Asus, Lenovo mobile phones.6) Takes about an hour to charge."
Call quality is bad wobbling noise can hear properly,1.0,It's good for music and not good for receiving calls. First few weeks it was working fine but after that when I receive call the voice is wobbling and u can't hear other person properly. Then I have to disconnect the Bluetooth and heart from phone only. Seem waste of money.
Amazing Quality,5.0,"It's connectivity is very good.The best thing, I can use it with my mobile and laptop simultaneously.The battery backup is amazing.Initially my friend purchased these earphones. I exchanged my old earphones with him and tried from a week.After seeing the battery backup and build quality, I finally ordered these earphones."
Stopped working in 4 months Disappointing,2.0,In just 4 months the left earphone stopped working and today after 7 months the right earphone too stopped working properly it works only if the cord stays in a particular position. Very disappointing their service center is about 10 kms from my place poorly placed office during this Lockdown period they should have made it easy for customers to reach out
The best earphones,5.0,They are my second boat earphones i owned.....sound quality is really great.....it's noise cancellation function also works well...it can be connected to two devices simultaneously...but dont why this function is needed......otherwise these are the best ones i had......as mentioned battery lasts upto 6 hrs. when fully charged......not suffering from any issues because of earphones....
Positive Review,4.0,If you are looking for bluetooth headsets in the given price range Boat Rockerz 255 are the best in the category.Its sound quality along with the noise cancellation give you a good audio experience.The bass quality is top notch.Also to add the customer care service is very quick and easy to access.My headset was replaced with a new one when it malfunctioned from one side. The process of replacement was also quick.
Completly waste,1.0,Writing review after using 2 months of the product. Initially the sound quality was good and the connectivity was also good. But after one month of use connectivity problem started. After two month of use one day it suddenly got turned off and I was not able to turn ON the device. I registered complaint on there website and after 2 weeks they pick up the device and now after 2 week they collected for there pick up service. I will never going to buy there product. Pathetic service. Totally time and money wasting.
Don't Buy waste of money,1.0,"All are good, battery was good,  but I'm use only 1-2 hrs then after my both ears was so paining.And some voice are came whenever you ON to this like Chirrrrr.....Like koi wire ka shock ho rha ho.And ear piece was so hard.I can't use now.Waste of money.I'll request for refund."
Nice,5.0,"it's very very good product and no doubt about it, and its sound is pretty awesome bass sounds awesome. but you can't feel like a Samsung headphone cause it's too lower end product for sound. but still at the price point Of 1400 ok. but my original concern is that how I am gonna get service  this product as I know there is no service centre near about my location so how could I change.????  can you please help me about that"
"TRUE REVIEW, DO Read, not good for jogging quite good for gym",4.0,"The sound is 90% perfect, loud sound, goood enough bass, comfortable, not for jogging as the band jumps a lot n irritating, if not for jogging can go, calling quite good not bad, not suitable behind wall, but range nearly 10m, charing more then hr, playback 5,6 hrs didn't charge from 3 days, but wait for offers as it gets 999,i purchased in June 2020 at 999"
Good product,5.0,Good product. Easy to use. Good sound quality although I use it mainly for audiobooks so bass effect is not a concern to me. Not much of noise cancellation actually but would give good volumes even in noisy areas.It issue is it starts to become uncomfortable after about an hour of use. My daily usage is close to 2 hours and I've used a lot of in the ear type headphones.Bottom line. Definitely worth the money.
Boat 225 is much better than this,4.0,"In the matter of Sound Quality, it falls behind Boat 225,  however as this is bluetooth model, can be sort of fine. There is no lag at all, and thats very good, tried while playing PUBG, PrimeVideo, Netflix, Youtube. Noise Cancellation is really good, notifications for calls, turn on and turn off. Over all I rate 3.5/5.0"
Efficient but not effective customer service,2.0,"The headset is having a problem while attending the calls, there is lot of disturbing sound and voice becomes robotic. When I complained promptly the product was replace BUT THE PROBLEM REMAINS THE SAME.Second time I wrote an email requesting a call back when repairing the headset so that I can explain more clearly the issue to enable them to fix it, there was no response to that. Boat please make your service effective, please drop a message or call me to fix the problem"
Awesome while it lasted,4.0,"Okay so i am writing the review for my rockerz after 7 months of incessant use. The battery life of this product is top notch while the sound quality is at par.The Bluetooth connectivity is good but the range is pretty modest. I got it for 999 and hence couldn't ve asked for more. That said, as with almost every other earphone, one said of it has malfunctioned exactly after 7 months of use. I was actually expecting it to last a year but nevertheless it's a good product for the economy and value for money segments."
Faulty item provided,1.0,"The earphones kept disconnecting automatically. Applied for a replacement and was shocked to find the same issue of disconnection with the replacement as well.Reached out to Boat customer service center, they offered another replacement. But instead of the 255 pro+ which I ordered, they sent 255 pro! Absolutely pathetic!!"
Good Quality Headphones,4.0,I am using these headphones last 3-4 months. It's Nice and Good Headphones. Sound quality is really nice. Build quality is also good. Bluetooth Connectivity is superb. You can use two device at a time. Some mobile devices you can listen music between the calls That's great thing. But when i talk with others on phone calls that time background noise of other callers you can here compared to the person voice you can't hear properly that time. But its happen when you are in rush or crowded area. The noise cancellation can improved by bolt Rocker so it is really superb budget Bluetooth headphone in india.
Fully dead,2.0,"I bought this blutooth headset. (Boat Rockerz 255+pro) .after one month charging problem. I connect  charger its a red colur light sparked .after 20mins, i on this headset no working ...1month i used so no return option .i lost 1500Rs for this headset ..now this price 1100Rs .so what i tell about online product is use and throw may its a 10000000Rs product. If u used 1months after its may anything problem.your full amount lost üò™üò≠üò•üò¢"
Waste of money,1.0,"First 30days worked fine, but later on it is not getting charged even if you held the charging for almost a day. It is not, 20% of charging showing. It is not getting properly paired to the PC(laptop). These are few issues I found that for someone might be helpful before buying this product."
Not same like earlier bOAT products,3.0,"Packing is good but I'm getting lot of noise while talking on phoneIt's just 24hrs back I used to start the product but I'm not still feeling like this is new one.,  might be this is the first failure product from bOAT# Not connecting phone while i kept in My pocket# Sudden Battery discharging# Lot of noise while on phone call# sudden sound got disappear while playing music track# Specially not feeling comfortable while I using at gym / Running track"
Think before you choose,1.0,"Quality wise OK / Better battery back up is goodBut for replacement service is very worst,If Amazon Team not involved in the support.... I couldn't get my replacementI would suggest to go with sennheiser headphonesThat's good quality headphones  with excellent sounds clarity.... And worth of money."
Very good product,5.0,"This is my first wireless headphone. From the first experience, it is good. I am getting an average of two days of battery life, sound quality is also good. Overall I am satisfied with the product."
I get first time damage products for Amazon I replaced.,2.0,Let's see replaced headset delivery how is it work.i do not think boat is like this damage headset send.ok but it gives replaced option. I don't think boat do like this next product not durability than I don't believe boat company ever.
Worst,1.0,"It's flexible but I am little worried about its strength ,sound quality is nice ...But i would recommend ptron buds if u love buds ....HEY PLEASE DON'T BUY IT , ONLY ONE EAR IS WORKING, IT HASN'T BEEN EVEN  A 1 MONTH"
COMFORT OF WEARING IT,3.0,"firstly received the product on time and in good condition..now moving to like and dislikes:  -what i like about it:-1)its dual colour tone is very attractive .2)simple to  use .3)economical.4)Sound quality is good.dislikes:-1)charging display is almost invisible ,you need to actually find out the indicator.2)not comfortable for long use.3)loss of connectivity while in use."
Amazing product in a stealing deal price,5.0,Overall highly satisfied with this product . Have tried many Bluetooth wireless but for me this is a game changer as I am highly choosy in terms of bass and noice cancellation and lesser prone to show offs .Must buy for a people whose range is between 1000-3000 .
Pathetic customer care service,2.0,boat customer care service is pathetic. My Bluetooth earphones stopped working within 3 Months. Replacement issued status is being displayed since 10 days and no updates since then. Won't get back to the customers by promising to do so when they are not able to answer the calls. Have been trying to call them everyday since last week
Best in class Bluetooth earphones,5.0,"My review after using this product.Honestly this Bluetooth earphones are best at this price range. Sound quality, bass quality is great. Mike is also good. Have separate volume management from android phone's volume, but make it's own volume 2,3 points low from max volume, as max volume comes with a little background noise. Bluetooth range is absolutely 10 meters. Overall great product.. I strongly recommend it.. Go for it"
Noise Cancellation is not good .,3.0,"I am writing a review after used more than 6 months boAt Rockerz, the Bluetooth range is not good, if you have Skype or Zoom call there is a lot of noise on other, I have always faced an issue while Skype or Zoom call, even on a Phone call is not giving good output results.yes, i can say for listing songs, this is really a good product. but we are not purchasing for songs only, right ?"
Worst experience and worst performance,1.0,Have worst experience with this headphones also the performance is very worst after using 1 month now the the range of of the headphones is become very low as u put beside you it instantly get disconnected and also there is noice breakdown while playing music or video and some cracking sound occurs during playing the sound I want to replace it or refund whatever is possible please givee ASAP
"Dont buy it it stopped working within 10 days ,and there is no option for return also.",1.0,"Worst experience with boat rockerz 255pro + first time i purchased this brand within 10 days from purchase date it stopped working. And there is no return option also ,totally worst experience, go for branded and trust worthy like sony WI C200 i used it for 2 years, DON'T BUY THIS EARPHONE WORST EARPHONE IN MY EXPERIENCE EVER ,AND DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS CHEAP BRAND üëéüëéüëé"
Best ones in this price range,4.0,"Pros:1. Battery backup2.  noise cancellation3. Easy connectivity4. Best sound quality at this priceCons:1. if you use this continuously for more than an hour, pain starts around the ear.2. Length of the wire is too long.Overall recommend to buy it"
Best buy in this budget.,3.0,"Best headphones on this budget though the noise cancelation is not efficient overall performance is solid and especially the battery its not exactly 40 hours but we need to keep the volume in or below 50%otherwise in max volume it is playing for about 16-20 hours , the asap technology is cool for10 mins 10 hours is like already we have seen it in oneplus bullets totally a good quality earphones in this budget."
Mediocre product,3.0,Overall product is good but somehow it doesn't fit nicely inside my ear. Tried with all sizes of ear tips. Somehow it fits but not recommended for long hours.Started painting after 1 hour of usage. I only use it for workout purpose. For better sound experience I'd suggest to go for over the ear headphones. Much more comfortable
Exceptional Sound Quality,5.0,"Best Bluetooth headphones within this range, most importantly it is Indian Brand.Exceptional sound quality with extreme bass options, light weight, handy, portable, good sleek design.It has a good battery life of 6-7 hours and it gets full charged within 40 minutes from 0% to 100%.If you are using bluetooth and wifi on the same time, then the range of wifi becomes less, it is not an issue of the headsets but it is an issue of mobile.Go for it guys, best ones in this range. NO ISSUES! üòÅ"
Not very good product,3.0,Not very satisfied with the product. The ear clip became loose and have to adjust all the time. The neck bend became shapeless after few days. Sound quality is good. Battery last as it mentioned in description which is good.
Boat is boat,5.0,Delivered before a day to day that scheduled. thanks Amazon. Product is excellent no words to speak under this budget. Battery still 80% from yesterday night to till today morning 12pm. Got with 100% battery when opened and connected to the phone. Above all got it for just 999/- that too on COD. Love you ‚ù§Ô∏è Amazon. Boat is boat no comparison just awesome.
Not worth buying,3.0,I bought these for listening to podcasts and audiobooks mainly so the audio quality isn't meant for listening to such audio files also there's an annoying incoming call aural alert when someone is calling and that would've been tolerable if it didn't work when I put DND on my phone but to my disappointment even after that it gives aural alert
Hissing noise when the default rubber cushions are used.,2.0,There is a hissing/humming noise when the default rubber cushions are used. Changed them and the sound quality improved. Just OK for the price. Not recommended at all.
Bluetooth connectivity is an issue,3.0,First I'll talk about prosSound quality is decent for the price if you can get it in 1000rs on sale otherwise better options are available.Noice cancellation is pretty goodBattery life is pretty decent as wellConsI find Bluetooth connectivity poor I don't know if it is the problem with my deviceCause when I walk wearing this and having phone in my pocket there are lot of glitches in connection which I found pretty annoying
The best earphones yet !,5.0,"Above expectation, excellent sound quality and the battery life is just incredible, one charge easily lasts you around mote than 5 days with normal uses (only music while traveling) and 6-8 hrs in one go if you using it continuously. The durability is nice and the magnetic feature really comes handy when not in use. Light weight very negligible weight and not noticeable when around neck, but sometimes this may result of loosing it and not suitable for bike ride (if riding at high speed)."
Good Warranty one year,4.0,"Warranty is the best part.After few months one side stop working. Since warranty is 1 year, i got it replace in a week or 2, since then I'm using it for more than 6 months. So far so good.Sound is clear. Ear fitting is comfortable. Battery life is also good as well.Don't expect good bass sound and noice cancelation."
Disgusting after sale service of Boat,1.0,"After using it 3 weeks i realized that it is malfunctioning, i tried to use warranty service of Boat but it is disgusting. My product was picked up on time and after some days i received used & old Boat Rockerz 239 Blue in replacement of my 3 weeks used Boat Rockerz 255 Black.I forwarded a mail to Boat customer care to look into this case but they are not responding."

I applied through they didn't responded for ky problem totally money waste don't buy thz üôè
"Not recommended, flickering annoying sound",1.0,"Don't buy it, after 1 day one side is producing annoying flickering noise. Totally disappointed.  I have been using boat earphones for almost 2years and I am keep going back to buying this because there is no such good option available. Based on my experience every product I bought, I need to replace it because it stopped working after 4-5 months. I know that's covered with warrenty but it's really annoying."
Highly disappointed,1.0,I googled it before purchasing this product and really found it amazing.Today I received my order and was exciting to operate.After listening half portion of the song I immediately removed it.The bass quality is so high that my ears started paining and it sounds really pathetic. I didn't like the sound and not even the bass. The sound really bumps into my ear.But still I didn't loose my hope for this product.After this I called few people and used this product still there was some issue.Sometimes people were not audible to me and sometimes I was not audible to them.So guys please please don't buy this when you're looking for a nice product and if you're spending 1000 that too on wireless earphones.So highly disappointed.
Bluetooth Range Connectivity Issue,2.0,Bluetooth range connectivity major issue.This is a replaced product for prior sound issue. However facing the range connectivity issue with replaced product. Not happy with Boat Rockerz. This time disappointed. Unfortunately I missed the return date to re-return or re-replacement.
Best in class battery backup üëå but it hurt your ears üëÇ,3.0,"Best in the price range I must say, Battery is best of the deal with 255 pro +, stylish look, lillte heavy, average built and great sound but the worst part of it is it will pain you in the ear if use long session like I do , have using it since 7 days and it pain me a lot so before purchasing please keep in mind to use it as much less as possible or have stronger ears üëÇ"
Perfect friend for daily use,4.0,"I have been using it for the past 2 months and seemed like a good time to review it now. Firstly, the headphones are very trendy and not at all cumbersome. The magnets behind the earphones help to keep them untangled. The in ear design cancels all noise and keeps the music clean. The music urself is very pleasurable as the bass and treble keeps the perfect balance and gives u an wonderful experience. Connection range is around 100metres and works well with call as well."
"Bad product, pls don't buy",1.0,"Bought in February, after 4 months it stopped charging, waranty claim took 1 month to replace, and after getting replacement in 1 month again the replacement product stopped working. Just don't but this....made in china are always like this"
Frequent disruptions during calls are  disheartening.,3.0,"I like 80% of the Boat Rockers and I dislike 20% about it's sound quality.Listening to music was fine but during call there were frequent disruptions and disconnections.I had to frequently on and off Bluetooth and connection to get back to the other person on the line.It is better to throw away if we have to use it for long calls/talks.Other features are fine so keeping for listening to music only.Overall, bad experience."
Battery discharge in 2hrs use,1.0,Sound quality is very good but my concern is BATTERY its getting discharge in 2 hrs.I'm keep on replacing the product again and again but battery life is the same as mention in all the product.4th times going to replace it but I know that product will also be same.Hoping that product battery will be fine.
Right ear bud not working,2.0,I bought this nine months ago because had good reviews till now the earphones were working fine but suddenly in this quarantine it has stopped working the right ear bud is not working I ordered the earphones with one of my friends id and now I am not in contact with the friend also it shows no replacement option I really want to return this product if possible please help me in doing that
Happy Experience,4.0,Bass is awesome... Loud speakers.. excellent connectivity... only disappoints at full volume..little noisy and not so happy experience in full-volume... but overall great product if compare with other brand... simply replacement of JBL products in less price.. you can consider it.. go for..
Avg product. better option available in same price range,3.0,Avg product. Better go with some other one.buds are heavy and keep falling of ear.Sound quality ok. Battery backup is excellent.Bought for 1399. connectivity not an issue till now.
boAt Rockerz wireless headset,4.0,"I am using it now for almost 4 weeks. The product is very good and gives the freedom of handsfree operation especially during workout and driving. The cost to quality is very good. However, it doesn't provide the battery life as claimed by the manufacturers. Also gets disconnected (especially when idle for more than 15-20 minutes). This has been experienced especially while driving."
Justifying the price !!,4.0,I am using boat since last 4-5 yearsI love it‚Äôs bass and battery backupLittle disappointed with build quality because Once I returned Boat Rockers 255 pro plus because of there was some Gap in battery cover !! And again found the same and I don‚Äôt want to play return game again and again !!!
Boat Rockers  BT 255,4.0,"One of best BT Earphones at this price range, noise cancellation is really awesome. BT connectivity is good some time when mobile is on pocket lite disconnections for Milli seconds...other than this product is good at this price range, audio sync with video is perfect.....!!! Boat is best at this"
below expectations,2.0,not that great sounding earphone  i will recommend that others should invest little bit more and buy the mivi earphones that is obiously better sounding than these pair of earphone ... and there is lot of problem regarding connectivity also when the earphone battery percentage becomes 80% then there is crack in the sound.and if you expect good vocals then this is a trash  only there is bass which also becomes muffled after the battery drops to 80%.. for me this product is absolutely no.  But one good thing that i found is that it has a good battery life.
VERY BAD CONNECTIVITY ISSUE,1.0,"I have been using this product for the past 2 months and I'm having trouble with the Bluetooth connectivity of the product. After a month of use I started facing these issues. I don't know if was the Bluetooth or the speakers, but surely it wasn't worth the money. Also, the battery backup is not as good as it claims to be. But yes, the teal green colour is really pretty."
Not good,1.0,"I did not like the fit at all. The hook was constantly irritating me then I removed them, after that the earbud kept coming out of my ear and I had to fit them to my ear again and again.Sound quality:- bass is not goodThose people who like loud noise and too much bass can go fot it but not for me.Also there was a lag sometimes, so I returned the product"
Worst ear phone ever,1.0,"First of all it does not fit in the ear, its coming out every now and then, its really irritating. My brother have realme earphone, it perfectly fits in the air. Seco ndly it is not working after a month now, I cannot return it back. It is connected with my phone, volume is full, but cannot hear anything. I'm very disappointed with this purchase, will never suggest boat."
Very good product,5.0,When I order this product I was Little worried about the sound and battery backup.. bt when I get this product in hand then I satisfied with this product... This is a very useful product in low range... This is really value for money product... Bt if there noice cancellation is not so better..that's why a little bit problem faced on the other site persons when he or she is in call with me
Stopped working in 8 months.!!,1.0,Stopped working in 8 months.!! Right side stopped working. Used without abuse or any water damage. Lot of sound leakage. Its not worth the price. Buy it for less than 1000 when there is a deal. Defenitely not worth the hype.
Just read to know everything on this,5.0,Awesomeee heaphone with high bass and noice cancellation up to the mark. Totally recomendable to thkse who likes high pitch musics with hard metal sounds. It is in affordable range and is better than any other bluetooth headphones of this price. Boat nirvana is giving this product as the best quality bluetooth headphone in the market with a playback time of 12 hrs.. You can easily take it on a day trip and even its charge will not drop out.
Worst service by boAt,1.0,The Bluetooth ear phone stopped working in a month time and I have been struggling to get this replaced but haven't got response. I have even written to boat CEO and his mailbox is always full to accept the new mails. Not sure what to do but I recommend to keep away from boat products just for its pathetic after sales service.
Very bad earfone,1.0,"I purchased it 20/01/2021,but after 5 month there is charging problem,I call boat customer care for complaint but they are not responding,I call amazon customer care but they said this is not amazon warranty, contact boat.very bad experience.so don't buy any boat product on amazon"
"1 year Life , dont expect beyond that.",3.0,"If 1 year Life is Ok for you, you can buy it spending around Rs 1399  Else buy 2 quantity in mid range , that two will give you atleast 2 years life. My one stopped working just after 1 year even after taking immense care."
Battery discharges even when switched off.,1.0,Battery discharges even when switched off. Faulty battery has also caused the casing to loosen. Warranty claims process leads to a website where the link to register complaints leads to the service center page. Service centers don't pick up phones. Warranty claims made via emails are not acknowledged. Didn't except such quality issues with Boat as well as unsatisfactory customer support.
Waited for something like this..,5.0,Am writing this after using it for 3 weeks.. I always wanted bluetooth earphones with type-C charging pin and a big battery that'll last atleast for 5 days.. Got this on the first day itself and am much satisfied with the sound and battery life.. on the first charge for my usage it lasted almost 9-10 days.. dual bluetooth pairing works good.. magnetic on-off is not present but actually it saves battery life.. so am very much satisfied with the product and rating it 5 stars and worth every penny..
Amazon's eturn policy is not satisfactory,3.0,Overall Sound quality is not upto the mark. I have made request for return it but Amazon didn't execute return in time. I was asked to make another return request by cancelling existing one. Now instead of return Amazone making it exchange. This is ridiculousl and against the return policy.
"Was expecting best, but result is bitterüòë",3.0,"I'm fool that I buy this garbage gadget. First of all mic. Is not good, second company said it's work 7 to 8 hours with 20min full charging, no it's wrong, it take 50 min. Approx to full charge, 3 hours you can play. And most of glitches too much.I'll give 3 üåü becouse of BoAt is an India products. But you guys make good things if you want to make place on market."
One side of the bluetooth stop working,2.0,One side of the bluetooth stopped working within  a few days from purchase...and the service center takes estimately 20-25 days..so i would suggest you to shift to some other brand...hope this is helpfull to u.
Bad product don't buy...,1.0,"Actually I thought this product is good..that's why I purchased this last week... From starting day only  fully I'm disappointed bcz package and delivery is good.. but product quality is not good...  It's automatically disconnected while I'm talking in call.. soo much disturbance sounds, and charging capacity also very low. Really it's a rack product bcz this exactly opposite to what they given What they given in features ..This earphone helpfull for only lessening videos and audios. For that also charging capacity is very low..Please help me how can I replace it..."
Horrible first Experience,1.0,"I purchased it on Friday July 26th and got it delivered on 27th .. I started using this product from Saturday.. Used it exactly for a day and it stopped working all of the sudden though battery is 40 percent left.. Tried to charge it but I could see its not charging too... While I was hearing songs,  few times I could feel disturbance (Song breakdown) ... Really disappointed with this brand.. Spended 1400 for this and it's not working.. Though Amazon told me to return it and I did the same and they promised menew one,  first experience is always the best and it's ruined in my case... I felt like if the replacement item also won't work,  I will ask them to refund money and go for samsung level 2 spending 1000 bucks extra. . Sound quality is good but.."
After listening 2 month it's right side earphone don't give clear sound . So please don't buy it.,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†When you called then not a clear sound is coming so this is very dissatisfied with that product.I change the headphones but new one has little better performance but not satisfied.  I think this product not too good or not too bad . But you can listen music or video clear sound."
Overall good,4.0,Sound bass is very good feeling like home theater. Battery life is so so. Only 80 and 60% is showing battery life always when i use it 1 day next day it is showing 80% and 3rd day showing 60% after that when battery goes 0% not known. After 60% it can off but not alerting that battery is low.
Worst headset with mic issues,2.0,Best bass in this price range and far better battery backup compared to the competitors.But the biggest issue was with mic
Waste of money. Do not buy.,1.0,Not upto the mark. I thought it is one of the best product.  But sound quality is average. Battery dies in just 4 to 6 hours. Getting pain in my ears as I wear this while watching movies or listening music. I thought there was some problem with the product I got first so I had to replace this item. But the product I got this earphone second time then I realised it's not just one item  but the whole model is bad. In just 1 month it's gone. Not charging and cannot switch on the product.I would rate just 0 star.
A good buy.. Good quality prouct,4.0,"I have been using this product since early feb and it still works like a peach. The sound quality is brilliant. Never experienced a break in the Bluetooth sync. No sound delay while watching videos and the battery life is excellent too.. I just have one complaint, well actually its faced by the people who i talk to over the phone. Whenever I use this product to talk over the phone, they always complain about too much background disturbance. It does not cancel out the background sound of others talking around you. Rather their voices gets amplified and I have to immediately stop using it. I validated this by being on the receiving end and the complains definitely is genuine. I think this is the only issue which restricts it from being the ultimate product."
All over product is good and the delivery period was very good.,4.0,"With all the good things I have saud .I want to add one more thing that the product is genuine , you don't get to see a fake product.Now one thing for the boat earphones I wanna say what I don't like is their comfort in ears , you can't wear them continuosly for more than a hour, the soud quality is good but at thsi price range comfort has been compromised ."
It is a very good Headphone for Online classes,5.0,It is a very good headphone I loved the style and the colour of it and if you want to buy this and have any doubts about it don't worry it is a very good headphone.It is orange and black which I have taken it is the best than elpful for online classes as it doesn't let out of ear voices to come you can only hear the headphone voice and when you talk no background voices will catchup your mic so go for it.
worth money,5.0,amazing earphones. sounds quality realy awesome. little costly when i purchased before offer but value for money. Nd battery life is also too good. i purchesed and after that 6 days without charging it works. somebody is searching for bluetooth earphones for music this the best choice ever according to me. should purchase i m giving 5 star
Buy at your own risk,1.0,"This earphone was delivered on Aug, 31. Today after 9days it has stopped working. I switched it off for charging(after low battery notification) and now it won't turn on. Tried calling Boat customer service but no response. Amazon return/exchange window is closed. Worst experience! My opinion is buy at your own risk. You are lucky if problem arises within return window."
Honest review,2.0,"Ok guysSound is 3 out of 5 only bass no serious good soundSound is not very high for pubgThe biggest problem is that i ise iphone and it beeps very much while increasing or decreasing volume, changing song playing paise even while dragging it , it feels very bad and it is very annoying . My honest advice is that it should‚Äôve been not priced for more than 1000 rupees"
After service very bad.... charges are taken,1.0,After service is worst ......if u claim guarantee they will charge u half the price of products believe me u will regret after using boat service very pathetic service watch YouTube replacement product they will hand over you used products and replacement will take atleat 2 month don't believe me see YouTube videos
Stopped working just after the warranty period and the service centre doesnt have repair facility,1.0,Stopped working just after the warranty period and the service centre doesn't have repair facility.Now the only option is to discard the item since no one can repair it. Surprised to see this from such a brand.Can never buy boat products again.
Decent Earphones at a decent price,4.0,"Pros:- Decent sound quality- Good neck band support to avoid having the earphones plugged into your ears all the time (like airpods or true wireless buds)Cons:- Connectivity gets broken at times, but the frequency is low.Overall, I would rate it very good for the price-performance ratio."
"Great build quality, decent sound, earbuds bit heavy.",4.0,"Great build quality. For a rough user like me, the rugged cables are just perfect. The bass quality is great. The only issue is that the ear buds seem a bit heavy, and they keep slipping off. But they're fine once you get used to it. Great buy, the wires will last you much longer than any competitor."
Recommend to try this product,4.0,"I've bought this product. For the music lovers it is really üëå. It has good noice cancellation and the mic works great but the only drawback is that the music doesn't stops even though the ear buds are connected with their magents inbuoit in it. Apart from it the bass, noice cancellation, mic and the batteryüîã backup everything is good and it is affordable price."
Failure model don't buy this,1.0,"Within a month it is repair. Issue is power failure. It is dead condition.And I requested for service and sent on October 9th today is November 2. Feed back from Boat side is, this product is not available now and feature also. They decided to give lower version and low price alternative model Rockers 330 model without consulting me. And also very very delayed response from boat."
Great but can be better overall,3.0,The only reason I'm giving it a 3 stars is not because I'm disappointed of the sound quality because in this price range I feel it's amazing but the quality of the ear tips is woeful. Its not even been 2 months or so that I am using it and it's already shredding to pieces. In a earphones the sound quality is the most important but you cannot ignore the quality of the ear tips because one is going to wear these for long if required. I cannot keep buying ear tips every now and then. Please improve the quality of the ear tips but great job with the sound quality.
"Product is not usefull if you are hear music ,video ,audio using slow internet while travelling",1.0,"Quality is good but seriously not happy because of below reasons :1)When I keep mobile in pant pocket,unable to hear or there is glitch to hear via bluetooth.2)When are trying to see video using low speed internet,whenever video buffers and starts to play,I always hear beep sound which is very annoying.This product is not usefull if you are hear music ,video ,audio using slow internet while on move [in car ,cab etc]"
Very Good,4.0,very good I am happy. But connectivity issue is there. It shows 2 things 1 is hands free and another is stereo headphones. Stereo headphones doesn't work well sometimes. Bad connection. But sound is good with stereo.
Bad product quality,1.0,I brought this product in Diwali offer and within 2 days it's found defect. Not connected in the phone after 7-8 times connected. even though very next day not working I checked charging code also connected on charging but not showing charging lights. Again I gave request for replacement with same product. this product supposed to replaced on 30.10.2019 but I didn't not received any replacement. I have vary bad experience with this product as well as Amazon services...Needs to be more attention on product quality check and customer services....This is not customer satisfaction....Till now I didn't not get replacement4th Nov still Amazon not taken any action after complaints logs 3 times
Review after one month of use.....,4.0,"Review after one month of use.....I am getting a battery backup of 5-6 hours a day.Bass is too good but still it could have been more beautiful.It's not good for gaming performance and not for gaming like Pubg.Oneplus Bulletz and realme buds wireless are much better than bass and sound.Battery backup is not good, but it's good to have a first charger to quickly charge in an 1 hours.* Overall it can be bought. Value for money (4.2*)"
Worst Bass I Ever Heard,1.0,No thump/bass at all... Better to buy normal 255 which I had previously which has a descent amount of bass... Most of the reviews over any media about bass of this headphone is falseBattery is only thing good which last for a whole day with continuous usage.Very dissatisfied with the quality of sound .Maybe local headphones are better
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,1.0,"After using this product for 8,9 long months and replacing 2 units after malfunctioning in warranty period,this thing malfunctioned again on the 3rd unit!(within 20 days)And now u dont even have warranty period left to claim new one.I dont understand why amazon recommends this product.If you are looking for something which will last for 3 months,go for it!"
Its amazing,5.0,"Writing this review after using it for 20 days  I found it very good in its price range.  Good battery backup, good sound quality and I also use it as bluetooth mic for online lectures.  So far so good"

For others 4.5 Star out of 5 Star. 20 hours continue uses on anything call/music/video watch. you can use this 20 hours in one day or in a week its your choice but for this you just have to charge only one time.
"Charging, back-up,Noice problem",1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†First problem which i am facing is this that i have a 33v vivo flash adapter & i charges the bluetooth by this adapter and its not giving me pure battery backup. 2nd problem is that when its not in use but power is on & plugged in to ears then its giving birth to a abusive noiceüòëlike hmmmmmm.

Value for money..,4.0,"Good product at this price, i got it in sale in 999. Sound quality is good, connectivity is also good, but you will start loosing connectivity when you keep your cellphone in back pocket. It has good bass, vocals can be better. Overall satisfied with the pelroduct."
One of My Fav Buy,4.0,"Using it since last 4 months, I love it. I'll recommend it to buy.Good Bluetooth connectivity. Good Battery Life. Good Sounds. That's why I bought it.BUT ... The manufacturer should provide extra ear supports and supporting buds."

Value for money,5.0,Its awesome having good bass quality and having a non stop working efficiencyfor long time and it work for many hours for a few minutes of charging üòéüòéüòé......totally satisfied
Sound and Mic issues,2.0,"Pro's - Packaging, easy wireless syncing with laptop/android, noise cancellation, battery.  Cons - Extremely bloated bass which makes it hard to listen to music to, poor mic which attracts complaint of poor sound quality while using phone/skype. These headphones are useful for sports/workout only.  Not for serious music listening or any use which needs use of the mic."
Good but durability is doubtful,3.0,"Used it for 4 months, sound quality is good, extra bass effect is also good. Decent sound on calls, movie clearance is really good. charging time is 2hr and play time is 7-8hrs continue, on call time 5hrs, stand by time is more than 24hrs.Connectivity is fast n easy, BT range is good when compare with other brands,Durability - Can't say about it as for mine, left sided stopped working, cannot clam the warranty as the amazon bill is faded completely no soft copy available."
Worst head phones I've ever used,1.0,After use of only 2 days suddenly head set was not switching ON and not charging also.  Never experienced a defect in any electronic device with in 2 days. Completely disappointed with Boat the so called great Indian brand.  Chinese product would have lasted at least for a month.Couldn't return due to loss of user manual and packing box. Waste of money
Nice but need some improvement,4.0,Received this today and it sounds good but some thing is not good for me that are :1. Bluetooth range is not more than 7m2. Wire when we wear looks awkward3. Sound is not that great but but bad4. In my phone it always shows it be fully chargedThese are the things but I'll keep this product just because some times i don't feel comfortable using normal earphone and for that times i needed a Bluetooth earphonesAlso for wire I've done a modification by just using wire tie which i felt useful for meAttached a picture of the same
Worth every rupee,4.0,"It's very comfortable in the ear. The sound quality is good..but the bass is pretty good. Ideal for jogging.but sometimes the band my get in the way. When you are wearing it on your neck it is super long and doesn't look that great. The magnets are fine, not super strong but not bad at all.the best part is the ear support which helps a lot cuz generally they never stay in my ear but now it never falls."
"Worst Product Received - Dual Pairing Issue, Sound Ambience Connecting Issue",1.0,"Again I received Worst Defective Product - Dual Pairing Issue, Sound Ambience Connecting Issue. Neither it's working in two devices simultaneously, I need to switch it of and again on then only it's working in second device. Will I be doing this EVERYTIME? That's so worst experience I had agaun today."
Good product with good material and good extra bass,5.0,"This product is worth of money and the quality and the material of this product . This is made by the best sound quality company which is boAt they have extra Bass with extra quality it is good for doing yoga and while jogging , in sports the distance between your any device with this  is very good and it needs a little bit charge in a week in a week ,  it gives 1 year warranty by the boAt  and a very good quality and Amazon is providing us very fast in delivery so thank you"

Bassy Rockerz,3.0,"boAt Rockerz 255, when it comes to your hands you can feel it's wires are a bit stiffer and don't move flexibly. Also the buds' rubber quality is poor.Base is too much. It almost fades the real music of songs. What you will enjoy is a song full of base but not the real song and music."
Decent sound,4.0,The build quality is quiet good. It's flexible and easy to carry. You don't have to bother about it's safety. Now comimg to the sound quality. In this price range it's very good. Base is punchy. Base lover will love it. Other sound quality parameters are also decent. you can fell that. Battery backup is really awesome. Comfortable while using for a very long time. But I deducted one star because. Sometime you can fell it's lagging. While playing pubg or asphalt. I don't know it depends upon handset or it is the problem of boat itself. But I am highly recommending it to buy.. in this price range it's really great.
Not bad...3 üåü is enough,4.0,I received after 10 days delivery was awesome im a prime member ü§£ and also delivery person was refused to come and deliver my door steps by the way come to reviewIts quite good headphone....Bass is goodI feel pain in my ear after 30 minutes of hearingBut quality of the headphone is goodOverall not bad

Earphones broke within 2 months inspite of careful usage,1.0,Very bad product. Seems I received a poor quality one. The earphones one of the bud broke. No sound coming from it now. Even before breaking the sound quality bwas poor. Seema I wasted my money on these. I wish to get a replacement or refund.
Replaced an order... But not showing anything in tracking... It's disgusting...,1.0,"Got demo piece... No indication while charging...

Hopefully bt this week end...my review is -5 stars...Amazon is amazing... Zing zing"
"Problem on Zoom, otherwise good",3.0,"These headphone keep disconnecting on Zoom, which makes it impossible to use them for homeoffice. Sadly doesn't fulfill our purpose. If you like it just for free time they are good"
Ideal bye for regular use,4.0,It was a good buy. But Bluetooth connectivity has an issue. At times i lose connectivity when my phone is in lower pocket. Sound quality is good but not at par with Wired earphones in same price range. Noise cancellation is fairly ok. But wind noise isnt cancelled.
Awesome,5.0,"This is First day reviewComparing to Rockerz 255..Rockerz 255 pro is best.. Bass quality is very good, phone calling quality  , connectivity awesome..Recommend for buy..After completion 1 months again will post another review.."
Super quality for cheap price.,5.0,Overall the working is awesome. But I find a issue that the heavier earpiece will make you discomfort and in pain for using long usage.Bass awesomeSound awesomeBluetooth connectivity excellentMulti connect works goodBattery backup excellent (with help of power saving option you can get continuous play for 5-6 hrs and if we pause songs then the system goes to power save mode till if resume song.I recommend it for music lovers.
Hell with Nirwana,1.0,"I really want to say that I am fed up with boat product and service, after few months careful usage Rockerz become handicapped.When I went to service center they replaced with a refurbished,dealligned product.It is a one day job for me to go service center with this traffic. The product worked for few hours till I reach home. When I charged the Rockerz I promise that It can replace my iron box. Finally Rockerz is not getting charged, the faulty product earlier atleast one side it was working fine. Hell with Nirwana.I see that Overall One Year Replacement Warranty is a JUGAAD."

Good wireless earphone to buy,5.0,This is good earphone for hands free wireless experienceGood soundGood connecting/battery low related inbuilt audio messagesGood battery lifeLittle misfit/lose fit on the ears (depends on ear)Sometimes if connectivity issue with Bluetooth there are beep sounds (not always)Overall good ear phone
Couldn't get any sound except from phone call,1.0,"I am using this device since last 15 days, and it's totally waste of money. I could get sound via this headset from phone call only  but not from any media. I don't know what could be the reason for this problem however I hv tried all possible ways of troubleshooting to this problem but couldn't resolve it. I'm very much disappointed with this headset Boat rockers 1220. This is totally waste of money."
Superb quality go for it.,4.0,"This is a very powerful product in sound quality, build quality is superb,super bass sound, battery performance is very good, it gives backup about 6 to 7 hours. Which is superb,finally thank you amazon for safe and fast delivery."
Dead after 8 months,1.0,Worked well for about 8 months then suddenly stopped charging.Not very good quality.Not the effort to go for warranty as I will spend more money to travel to the service center.Which may include multiple trips.Avoid if possible
Great bass and sound at very affordable prices.,5.0,The earphones are really awesome bass. I got it at a very low price offer. The sound quality is great and I loved alot. Its way better to buy such kinda product at a very low cost. The noise cancellation feature works perfectly and without any issue. The bass is super duper awesome as well. As boat is usually famous for its bass Quality. Overall product is awesome i loved alot.
Very bad experience,2.0,Not good. Left one louder than right side so got replaced. Sound quality wasn't not good at all got ear pain after five minutes of use. Sound not clear in high volume it's very loud nd noisy.
"Best wireless headphones, simply superb",5.0,"Awesome battery backup, easily last for week of continuous usage. I generally use this to connect my office laptop for meetings as well parallely connected to mobile. U can connect 2 devices at time. So connected to mobile for 18 hours and laptop for 10 hours daily and it last for a complete week without charging. Charges quickly.. Just 30 mins charging is enough to last for 2-3 days. Good sound quality, good bass and light weight.."
Not for regular use,2.0,I have been using this device for last 6 months. I along with my other 3 friends bought this earphone together. After 6 months none is in working condition.1- the micro USB charging port is unreliable. It gets damaged easily.2- got problems connecting to phone after 3 months use.3. Right side speakers started producing irritating noise.It works best for 2-3 months. Ifbyou are a regular user kindly avoid this product because it won't last more than 6 months.
Bang for the buck.,4.0,"For music loversBass music is awesome in this rangeI tested with music like la calin for bass (kickass)Melody : juga capablanca ( ok dokay),, O saathi re ( ok dokay)EDM: KAMLESH audio addict ( kickass)Nucleya (aaja). KickassIt's basically good we go listen to bass and electronic genres. They sure will be a satisfied."
"Great bluetooth earphones, bass is not very good though",4.0,"Amazing battery life, great looks, sound quality is good. However, bass is quite poor and don't feel a lot of bass when playing party songs. For the price, it's just okay."
Average,3.0,"TBH, it's not a very good looking neckband. Gives a very cheap look when worn due to the length of the band and the wire. Sound quality is decent.I hope it has a good battery life."
Don‚Äôt buy for iPhone 6,2.0,Bluetooth range is very low when compare with my Samsung Mono headset...I used for iPhone 6 but it‚Äôs not compatible with that in distance..it‚Äôs work for me within the room only. But other Mivi bluetooth earphones workin well...I feel it‚Äôs waste of money for IPhone 6 users...bcoz I used it only on iphone6
**Connetivity issues and big in size**,2.0,"Size issues,Connetivity issues and size are real big, not comfortable to carry at all the time. **Big wire, neck band also big. Battery always says 90% !! So funny software sync"
All good barring one,4.0,"Pros: value for money, light weight, very good charge rate, good fittingCons: the ear plug latches have tendency to come out and are very prone to get lost. Once they are lost the ear plugs does not fit into the ear .... I guess they should attach it to the wire somehow ..."
Pathetic,1.0,"Really cheap quality & material, I'm not sure it is original boat or duplicate product.Sound quality is very pathetic. No background noise cancellation. Bass quality is zero."
Sound quality feels more like a local product doesn't sound like Boat earphones.,2.0,I have been using Boat wired earphones and bluetooth speakers but boat rockerz doesn't even sound like Boat. A genuine suggestion to those who buying boat rockerz over Mi sports wireless earphones Please don't go with the looks of this product. Sound quality is pathetic it sounds more like some local product. Looks and build quality is fine does the job but but fails to deliver crisp and groovy sound which you would expect from a earphone at this price range. Replaced twice not satisfied. I doubt if this seller is selling genuine product.
Very easier replacement during warranty period,5.0,"I am writing this review after using 11 months of this device, good sound quality and look wise, within warranty period ,my device found one side not working , I had lodge my complain online , the courier boy picked up this defective piece  from home , and within one month I got a new device after replacement..."
Not to go for this with Amazon,1.0,"Yes, the product is absolutely fine and great. But i would suggest not to buy this product from Amazon. Firstly, they gave me the product in which right bud was not fitting into the ear and secondly when I went for replacement so they gave me next neckband which was used and left bud is not working. So I request with flipkat at least they care for their customer experience when u return or complain."
Worth Buying,5.0,"Got this gem successfully üëåits overall good product . I've got it in ‚Çπ999 and that's worth buying.I'll recommend you to buy there without any hesitation if having budget üëçSound experience is way above expectation , since last year i've been using Jbl infinity but this one is 100* times better.You just need to equalise the sound acc. to your preffernce for insane experience."
More than value product,5.0,"I am very Happy with this product. It's awesome.Sound quality bestüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåNoise cancellation and bass quality GoodüëåüëåüëåüëåBattery performance unbelievable "" I used product after unboxing with company charged and after 6days battery üîã 20% remaining.

Good but if you get it around 1000-1100 rupees,4.0,The base is excellent. Sound is clear. Battery life is good. It usually sells around 1500 rupees but I got it for 1000 rupees at that price it's very very good but if it's around 1500 rupees than I would suggest to go with realme wireless which sells around 1800 and for 300 more you are getting more features and similar sound and better battery and connectivity. But if you can get it for 1000-1100 it's best.
The sound is not that great and the battery isn't promising as well,2.0,"I have been using the earphones for a while now. The main demerit is the battery , you have to charge it every now and then as it doesn't give good backup. The sound for bass intensive raps / hip hop tracks is not good. You can hear clear distortions and it isn't pleasant at all. Ironically, the noise cancellation doesn't work in this case. If you want an example , listen to Kendrick Lamar - Loyalty with the earphones and you can feel the clear difference.The most annoying thing about this is the bluetooth range and connectivity. It disrupts every now and then and the sound keeps tearing until you disconnect and re-pair with your device again.Overall , a very bad experience ."
Battery heating problem,3.0,I bought Boat wireless Bluetooth headset thisNovember 2019 onwards...First used boat Rockez worked good and I saw Battery heating problem in this product...Except battery heat problem everything is good....Some days gone...Ie 03.03.2020 Boat Rocket device battery failed...I am already posted review box that pics....Just i used normally 2/3 hours a day in 4 months used Boat Rockez device but now it is failed battery...I want replacement this device becoz of one year warranty is there...I waiting forThe company how can respond....Giving replacement device
No return policy.. total waste of money.,1.0,It's too clumsy..Don't buy it as no return policy with this product.It appears to look like a wired  headphone..A total waste of money...I think the company is also aware that it will not match the competition so the don't have return policy..
Battery and Bass are making this article a masterpiece.,5.0,"Sound quality and bass is awesome. Placement of mic near to mouth is worth to mention. Voice clarity while making calls is appreciable. Noise cancellation is moderate. Last but not the least, battery backup along with type C fast charge will make it a definately a eye catching deal at this price point with boAt branding."
Utimate sound... And device,5.0,Awesome sound clarity and value for money.. must buy for those who are looking to buy Bluetooth headphones.One main feature that I liked is its connectivity to two devices at same time.
Not for Video or Games,4.0,"Great music. Some lows are missing. Charging time is less. Running time is like 4 hours of call on full charge. (EVEN AFTER 3 MONTHS). So much lag in video and game. So, big NO there from my side."
Not that good,3.0,"It captures noise from outside, therefore, while speaking one has to speak louder for making his voice audible at other side. Nonetheless, receipients always complaint about the noise, which is being captured by the mic. It can be resolved by the company as the normal bud earphones do not have such problems."
Value for money,5.0,"I m writing this review after 1 month of usage. Product is no doubt a value for money, quality of material is decent, battery life is around 6-8 hours. I mostly use it for office calls n response is absolutely marvelous. Earplug wires r pretty long comparative to other neck bands. Bass is good and overall a must buy in this range."
Quality Buy - Price worth.,4.0,"This product is fantastic...it's got amazing quality sound and bass, clear and sharp microphone sound delivery, light weight and easy to handle. Voice guidance feature is cool.3 months down the line, it's started giving a bit of issues, disturbance issue via Microphone of the headset.Since it is a 1 year warranty product, in process of contacting for Warranty Support.I am loving it.Worth purchasing this headset."
Sound quality is not as expected.,3.0,Sound is not as expected .. I had the same piece before .. since I gifted it I had to purchase again .. but the sound quality is not as expected .. sad but true ..
Great BT Headphones,5.0,"Very good and comfortable BT headphones. hangs around the neck well. Magnetic earbuds cling to each other firmly. really good backup time. Easily goes upto 4 hours with heavy usage of phone calls, listening to music, etc. Easy to connect to any device. I have tried to connect to 2 devices at same time. My laptop (Win 10) and My mobile (Samsung A51). it does connects but the connection is not always reliable if connected to more than one device at same time."
Bad Experience with the Service of Amazon and boAt,1.0,"After receiving the headphone it was works fine but after 4 day's it stop working one side, later on I called amazon to return the product they straightway denied the same and said you have order it from the business account and return windows is closed, it has only 3 days return window instead of 10 days in regular accounts. then I contacted manufacturer for the replacement they took the product from me in 2 days after raising the compliant but it took 20 days to get the replace product. it is very very bad. my one month product warranty gone for toss."
BOAT is the WORST company. Do not buy their products.,1.0,"Read this before you buy : Every time you connect these earphones to bluetooth, a guy SHOUTS in your ears at the top of his voice ""YOU ARE CONNECTED TO BOAT ROCKERS"". Boat is the worst company, who is advertising itself daily even after selling the product to customers by shouting into users ears daily. You did not give the ear phones to me for free. Then why do you think it's okay to shout your name in my ears daily a 100 times? REMOVE THE ****ING MESSAGE. BOAT IS THE WORST COMPANY WITH NO ETHICS."
Best under ‚Çπ1000.,4.0,"I bought this product for ‚Çπ999 in January. They sound really good and are very comfortable. With the right size ear tips, you can wear them for a long time. I used them in gym, while travelling and they performed as expected.The battery will last 7-8 hrs easily. They charge from 0-100% in 2hrs. I was satisfied with them until I started having some issues recently like the greetings at time of power on/off stopped. The left side stopped working.But as it was still under warrenty, I raised a ticket on boat site. Hoping to get a positive response.I'll update their responseI got the replacement 15 days after the complaint."
Not That Loud But Got Superb Noise Cancellation & Battery Life,4.0,"To be honest, I was expecting a great sound & bass quality just like we get in boAt Bass Superhead 225, but it is just okay.. I liked its amazing battery life and noise cancellation feature. I also feel that it should read out the numbers like 99999..... or the Caller's Name saved in the contacts for an incoming call rather than just 'Incoming call'"
Not recommended,2.0,Initially it was working very fantastic then suddendly stopped working....  went to service center and saw 140 people waiting in line before me for almost same and other issues with Boat.
Awesome product & worth it -Boat lvr,5.0,Product is worth of cost ...Excellent sound quality meets it's power .Bluetooth connectivity is easy and fast.Also easy to use bottons provided.No problem with mic .Cable length and neckband are accurate.Charging and battery life is as good as spec.Their is a noise when getting messages while playing music.Charging port's cover/cap is not properly seated.Just bought on 19th October 2019.
Don't buy if you want to use it for running,2.0,I spent money on this product because I wanted good earphones for running. This product highly disappointed me. The ear plugs get loose and will get lost. I don't even know where my right ear plug fell. While using it for running the product didn't firmly hold my ears and thus it became difficult to be used while running.
I suggest you buy it good quality,5.0,I really love it sound's quality I'm using it since 2 week. and I'm facing an issue on call‚Ä¢ with my deviceInfinix hot 8 call audio not coming‚Ä¢ another device Samsung galaxy s 20 ultraNo problem found.I'm really disappointed why it's going on with me. I purchased it for using with infinix hot 8üò¶üò¶üò¶üò¶
"1* for the sevice, product malfunction very often.",2.0,"Brought it a year ago, had to replace the product  after 6 months for ear piece malfunction, now at the end of the 1year the same issue. Not value for money if this the type of product the give, and you need to wait for 15 to 20 days for the replacement to happen as they have to be replaced in Mumbai branch only."
Amazon looted,1.0,It has a great sound quality. It is durable. At first I did not receive the item.. But then a replacement was delivered.Edit : It stopped working after 20 days of purchase... The product doesn't charge now.. F***ing waste of money.
It's not as good as I expected.,2.0,"There's no Bluetooth connectivity at all, even if you move 2-3 metres it loses the connectivity, and also if you are walking, there's the connectivity problem. There's no noise cancellation, if you are in a busy place, the other end person won't be able to hear you properly. Only good thing about this phone is the sound quality."
Drop in Quality,2.0,I purchased this item by seeing one of my colleagues who bought this item last year. Quality was too good. Especially the wires & neckband was strong and sturdy. But now it seems to be very feeble and even the neckband is also not strong. Not just external features but internally the technical part quality has been reduced i think. It disconnects & connects back when i move a little away from my device. I did NOT expected this from Boat. Planning to return and replace this.
Automatically disconnected,1.0,"I don't like these Bluetooth because they are creating problem now.... automatically getting disconnected, the worst product i used ever, i bought this worst product √†t ‚Çπ1500. I want replace, dont buy this product, why amazon dont check the quality of the product.Please ban the seller otherwise no one purchase anything from amazon, they lose their brand name because of these fraud product sellers."
Worth it.,4.0,"Wonderful sound quality and bass is okay.The build quality is really good, because the way I use it, it should have been torn apart, but its still firm and really in perfect condition.This earphone is easy to use and carry as it feels like you have nothing on your ears. It's really light weight and comfortable.I highly recommend it"
Quality,4.0,I have been using it since the last 1 year and I must say that it's a very great product under 1000But now exactly after 1 year there are some technical issues such as very poor battery backup ‚òπÔ∏è and the sound is also getting a little bit torn but I must its great for workoutI would recommend you to buy it go for it definitely u don't have think twice but take good care of it and use its own usb cable to charge it
Realistic Review of these Earphones.,5.0,"To those who doesn't get to know the realistic review about this product.I've been using it for 2 days and understood the sound quality. And i F-u-kin love these earphones.Noise Cancellation is very good. You can't hear noises until you try to hear them.Comfortability. You can't listen for a longer period of time. It will start paining after 20 mins. These were not comfortable until i removed the wings. And i had some old eartips which i am using right now. These are more comfortable to me. And now i can listen to 4 hours straight without paining.Battery life is excellent. Used for 2 days and battery percentage dropped from 100 to 40%.Now the Sound Quality.Mids are average. Won't miss any sound.Highs (treble or vocals) is not up to the mark. BUT, If you adjust the equaliser settings then you can make it sounds so amazing.Lows (bass) is SO POWERFUL. Rockerz 255 was only made for the bass lovers i guess. Their only focus was on the bass. These earphones have extra bass.(i am saying this so many times because it literally has so much bass)The people who are saying that it would have been better if it had more bass are stupid as fun.I have used some high and mid end earphones like Sony Mdr xb55 with extra bass, Jbl T110 and Oneplus Bullets.At first when i heard, i thought i made a mistake by purchasing these Earphones but when i equalised it. I made it sounds like some high end earphones. And i am very happy with the purchase now.You will only like this if you didn't have an high end earphones. But if you have never heard an high end earphones and wants some eargasm then i must say that you should go with the product. You'll be happy with the purchase and dont forget to equalise."
Nice but aapko koi aur le lena chahiye,4.0,Achha h me ek mahine se use kar ra hoon but ab yeh thode outdated ho gye h aap logo ko 235v2 ke liye jaana chahiyeBut yeh pubg ke liye achha h latency zara bhi feel ni hoti ek dum perfect hLe skte ho mixed feelings h abt thisBass h but jyada volume me sunoge to kaan dukhne lagenge thode time me baki connection achha h dusre room tak bhi chalta h
Every thing is best ‚ô•Ô∏è,5.0,"Sound quality is Best‚ú®Bass quality is Best ‚ú®Build quality is Best‚ú®Battery life is Best‚ú®Noise cancellation is the Best‚ú®Charging speed is the Best‚ú®The awkward is the length of the earphone , it is slightly big as compared to other , you might feel odd while wearing...."
Product quality is compromised now,3.0,"I bought this product for the second time. Gifted the first one to someone, it's build quality was awesome. The current product which I ordered is of poor build quality. Headphone wires are of low quality, charging point covers if awful.Keeping the product with me as it has a 1-year warranty. Let's see how long it lasts."
Money's Worth...Go for it...without second thought.,5.0,One of the best wireless earphones till date. On the single charge works full day for using 5 hours of continuous music playback and talktime of upto 9 hrs in a single day with speed charging. The headphones gets charged in 30 mins for whole day use. Works excellent on my Oneplus 7T Pro and good connectivity for laptops Skype & video call.Don't give a second thought. Just goo for it. Total money's worth
Superb Bass earphone,5.0,"1. Super Bass even on full volume2. Treble is low3. Vocals are clear4. U may unable to hear more intruments in bass5 it is better than boat 2556 Original earphone will sound ""u plugged into Niravana"" if u r not hearing on starting then u r using fake earphone. This is sure."
Can Buy!,5.0,"If you're someone who has to take calls all day, you'll have to recharge it by end of the day. But when it has sufficient battery, didn't have any complains as such."
good sound with nice bass,4.0,"these earphones are very good for the sound they produce .connectivity has no issues ,comfortable for long periods of time , sound quality is very good and low frequency bass sounds are good (not super heavy bass) ,good for watching videos and movies , gaming has little lag in sound (due to wireless connection),battery life is fairly good (around 4-5 hrs of non stop usage at full charge at medium volumes) ... sound quality does not deteriorate at full volumes .....  built quality is good , does not feel cheap and flexible neck band ...good deal for =<rs.1500"
Good working only disappointmet,5.0,since from 2 months i am using this boat rockerzz 255 earphones this gadget has only one problem that is noise cancellation slightly the air going into my ears getting disturbance it should have to improve by boatBase is simply superb very good base and sound quality is also awesomeThis earphones is very good and battery back up is alsoonly one disappointing that is only noise cancellation so i request boat to improve the quality of earphones
I felt waste of money bcz 1 side of earplug has no sound.,2.0,"After just 10 days 1 side of ear phone has no sound, I really felt Rs.1500 has beem wasted on this. Everytime 1 side earplug gets removed while working and I have to plug that back bcz of no sound in the other. Really don't go with this."
Product is not working. I called for replacement.,1.0,"Today I received the product. It is worst product because it is not working. Firstly I was read instructions which is mentioned in product manual and fallow that instructions for handling and switching on the product device. The product is working on when it is on charging.  As the charger disconnected, headset switched off automatically and not responding as per manual instructions. I called it for replacement. Please, as soon as give me the replacement and this time please check the product first and then dispatch. Thank You!"
"Sound, Bass and durability",3.0,"Well you might be surprised that after giving 4 star in every catogeries why I gave only 3 stars as overall rating, the reasons are I Bought 3 diff boat products, initially all of them were very good but none of then lasted for long So I think company is doing this knowingly so people buy its product again and again,Lets talk about productSound  4/5 balanceBass 3.8/5Noise suppression 4/5Clarity 5/5Design 3.5/5But again this products won't last long so buy at your own risks.. üòäüòäüòä"
Another marvelous product from Boat.,5.0,Pro - feels like unlimited battery life.  - connects to multiple devices at the same time.  - love the bass - surround sound like feel.  - earpiece stays in ear.Conns - None as of now.
Customer service :(,4.0,"Firstly the voice quality of the product is very nice compared to others at this range, however the service from boat side is not right. Mu product was damaged at the 7th day and I initiated the replacement option, the reverse pick up was scheduled however no delivery information is available still. Itz being 3 days now, when you go to boat website the tracking status button does not works on the website and even you cannot reach an representative via call. I don't know if I am gonna receive the product back or not!"
Too good.,3.0,"The voice clarity & music bass is amazing.The only little thing to bother is the mic & buttons are separated from the collar , which is slightly difficult to handle."
Little less than an average experience,1.0,"Firstly, I am personally a big fan of boAt products. I think they have a good quality benchmark. However, this one might be a bad quality piece that I would have received. I was just simply not able to connect the set to my Mint OS. I cannot imagine a reason why!I am hoping that the replacement will sort this out!"
Average Sound quality but a sweet deep base that'll make you addicted,4.0,"Sound Quality of 255 is pretty average, falls short on lows but pretty much accepted when you get it for 999/-Base meanwhile is a different story all together, EDM's just don't sound the same and the deep deep base just sucks you inn.While it does falls short for crisp sound quality and treble, If you are a EDM person.. these are the best you can get for now.P.S.: I got it for 999/- hence the acceptable remarks. Definitely not worth it for ‚Çπ3.5k get any other wired earphone instead of these if you want better bang for your buck."
"Amazing Product, Highly Recommend",5.0,Giving the review after 2 month of purchase.Thanks to Amazon for fast courier.The product is amazing.Great voice quality.best fitting in ear.Nice quality.Euff and stuff use.I am using 2 phones it's useful to connect both of them and receive call from both of the phone.
Battery problem and on off problem,1.0,"Extremely disappointed by your product, i bought this earphone on February,but it went defected so earlier. Fist 50% battery runs good but other 50 gets down in half an hour. When i connect it to my phone after running 1 min ,it goes disconnect itself, i have to connect it every time. I don't know why its happening so, please friends be careful before purchasing this product boat rockerz 255pro."
Latency!!,3.0,Bought this product a month ago and this product is steal for the price. But you just shouldn't buy it. The noise cancellation and the audio quality are both great. But there is latency of almost 1 sec! I thought there was a problem with the video I was watching but after disconnecting them the sync was perfect. I tried YouTube and other video platforms and the problem still persists. I don't remember encountering this problem at the beginning but I didn't observe until lately
DO NOT BUY,1.0,"Device is unusable. The bluetooth connection is pathetic. It disconnects- reconnects every 2 mins, with sound breaking for 5-10 seconds. I googled this issue and guess what there are soo many others with the same problem. Only if I knew before buying, I wouldn't have wasted my money."
High Value for the Price,4.0,"Good sound quality, not 100% sound cancellation which is really good.  the little bent rubber pieces help hold them neatly in please when I am exercising or moving around.  Mic works fine except for my online language course.  It is not recognized and I do not understand how to adjust it to find the mic.  Any help?"
Very discomfortable in long duration uses.,1.0,"Ear pains when you use them  continuously for long hours.Very unfit for my ears.They r bigger to fit in ears.They should have applied small eartips.Apart from that battery is fantastic.Sound is good.IP ratings r better.But when you can't use them , then it doesn't matter."
Average and goods in that budget (999‚Çπ),3.0,"Sound quality is good.Sometime there is connectivity issue when you keep your phone in your pant. And battery back up is not that good compare to other brands.... If you need anything detials comment me , I will reply I have bought noise wireless  its better than boat rockerz 255 sport edition"

Got Broke 2 Times in the span of 6 months,1.0,"Just after 10 days the right side of the earphone stopped working , then the custormer servicec took 20 days for replacing the earphones , which is way too long then they promised .Again after a few months it broke again , I don't recommend this to anyone .As long it was working it was good but get's damaged even without any rough use ."
Good product by Boat,4.0,"The Quality of the product is amazing and this is my first Bluetooth earphone. Completely in love with it, its always on my neck for the complete day and never feels like anything is hanging on your neck. Coming to the battery, it lasts for 4-5 hours on continuous use.But after few months lost one ear than the other. Now it's dumped. So you have to be a little gentle."
Decent product for the price,4.0,"Overall the product is okay for the price.Sometimes it doesn't connect to the phone automatically even though you have paired  it earlier.Also, the call quality is not that great.Although, It's good for listening to the  music."
good,4.0,"Good Sound (not excellent though)great comfortbut one run in the rain, and the LED indicator dimmed. it took a lot of time to recharge (not sure of future)Battery life is V.average (may be 2 hours maxxx).Cant run a Marathon for sure..."
Rocks....but packaging was poor,4.0,"Earphone is awesome, quality is superb, sound,bass, connectivity is super good , overall i loved it .Packaging was so pooorrrr.... Terribleüòñ, outside box is totally broken, there is no bubble wrapping for this delicate kind of item, this is totally disgusting work done by seller, please improve your packaging...."
Not impressive,2.0,"Not impressed with this, in similar price range better options are available. Was excited after Rockerz 510 was hoping for better performance but highly disappointed. Looks like just below par product"
Bluetooth fails to connect sometimes,2.0,"Bought this product couple of months back, was excited for the price I was getting for. But this is a total disaster primarily for 2 reasons:1. Once fully charged, this doesn't last for more than 12 hours or so2. Bluetooth fails to connect sometimes, even after getting paired previously. I could not even pair this to my Android phone (MI A1). Even sound quality is not so impressieI suggest buy a wired earphones than this."
"Great sound quality, great battery, lightweight",5.0,"Very good sound quality and effective noise cancellation. However if you are looking for using it for gym, then I suggest to use 255 pro version not plus because the external control makes it noisy while exercising. Otherwise best quality & lightweight. Great battery life."
Decent output. Poor noise cancellation.,3.0,"The sound quality is decent, but the noise cancellation is horrible. You definitely cannot use it to take calls. Its decent to listen to music and that's all. Battery backup is around 4 hours of continuous music play."
Light weight and an average quality output,3.0,"Pros:Lightweight productConnectivityPackingCons:Noise cancellation is not there compared to other productsAverage audio quality - No bass, treble"
Bass is good and good battery life,5.0,"I am new for using bluetooth headphones but found this one a good product at this price range. If you need more bass then treble, this is for you. Noise cancellation is average also voice call quality can be better. Sometimes it breaks during call. For the music, this headphone is good to use."
Good but could have been better.,4.0,I was happy with the product in the beginning. But then later it had pairing issues with my device. Also one side of the earphone has stopped working even before completing an year. I wasn't expecting this from such a good brand. I guess if you're paying this much price you expect the product to last more . Altogether a good buy. I would give it 4 star.
GOOD ONLY FOR SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.,1.0,"Used for 8 months . Good for intial fews months then battery problem surfaces (you cannot use if batt is at 40percent bcz it will become zero in 5-10min from there), then connection problem like voice gets distorted and sometime while listening to music voice lags and gets distorted also range of the Bluetooth decrease drastically and now one side earphone is completely off . If you are buying this product at best it is good for 3-6 months . My usage was simple  max around 2 hr per day"
Smart looking,5.0,"Crystal clear sound and good battery backup. Very much useful while traveling by two-wheeler. You can connect with the phone via BlueTooth, just insert the earbuds, wear your helmet travel without tension. The speech very audible even while traveling. Thanks to boAt Rockerz 255"
Ok but not bad for the budgeted guys go for it or else jbl,4.0,Mine is green color but color is not darkest as in the photo abd about sound it is ok who listens slow music or melidy songs but for full bass listeners go for costly 1 as jbl or more than 2k rs and battery stanby is good grip is very good snd also no disturbance to side people if u put on max vol. ok thank u if my review helpful plz like mro on box 2999.00 i got o lighting deal for 999.00
Good Battery Backup & Noise Cancellation without compromising sound quality.,4.0,"Bought this product on 24th August, battery lastedfor more than a month  with light to medium usage , 32 hours to be precise. Call quality and noice cancellation is really good even when you're travelling by train.  Good balance of treble and base. Only con is that the earphone tends to fall out while exercising and not comfortable to wear for more than and hour or two."
Good Headset,4.0,"Value for money, Ossam battery life stays up to 4 days of my office hours use and it charges so quick about 40 mnts. you have to change the buds as per your comfort for your ears which comes along with the headset. Recommend this as budget headset"
Amazing product,5.0,Using this for more then 2months.Amazing battery üîã. Charging it once a week and using fir daily meeting calls.Dual connectivty working amazingly.Fit perfectly my eyers most of others won't.
Amazing Bluetooth Product at this price.,4.0,"Hello everyone, this bluetooth earphone is really awesome at this price range. Best thing is that this is flexible so if you sleep using it this with not damaged as Samsung Level.Bass is really awesome. Noise cancellation is okay and bluetooth connectivity is good.After using some day I found that battery is works for more that 6 hours. If you work in office and only using for attend call, battery will work for about 12 hours. And almost in every phone if you used it for about 6 hour this may show full or 80% battery but it comes down immediately, this if not a battery, this is a software problem that not show battery falling slowly.  This is really nice."
Sounds and base quality is excellent,5.0,In this product a very very Good quality sound and very good bass quality and also best calling quality but build quality is on average because the logo of boat was erased in 1 to 2 weeks.  And this product are SUPPORT very fast charging to charge any normal charger.Charging time of this product is almost 1 hrs fully charged.. it's very fast and also very long time battery life of this product..
Good Headphone,4.0,This is overall good bluetooth headphone.Pros:1. Sound quality is good.2. Lightweight.Cons:1. Could not really make it work with 2 devices as indicated. That was the primary reason I bought it.2. Battery life is ok ok (may be becasue of the small size).
I loved it for the price range,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Mainly battery backup is awesome....40 hours it's really helpful....simply u can use it for 1 week after a full charge.... warranty is awesome if u don't have a store near ur location,they come to our location and get repaired sent back to our location....very useful for people who stays other than metropolitan cities"
Best in the price segment,5.0,"I am using it for quite a time now & i have to say it's the best one in this price segment. Sound Quality is outstanding with High Bass, it doesn't get wet even when i sweat a lot by running while wearing it. The noise cancellation could have been a little bit better, when on call the other person keeps telling me that background noises keeps on coming. Battery backup is awesome also, it remained on 100% even after playing videos & songs constantly for 3hrs. To sum it up, i have to say it is the best Bluetooth headset under 1500. You should really go for it."
Audio output is not good,3.0,"The earphones worked excellent during the first week, but then the audio quality at times was very bad. I could hardly hear the other person speaking, though it was pretty clear when heard through wired earphones."
waste of money,2.0,i gifted it to my husband ....whenever we talk ....he has to keep the microphone near his mouth ...if its lying in neck....i am unable to hear anything ..so no dont buy
DONT BUY- not worth the price- useless,1.0,Worst sound. I bought it 3 weeks back. And it is such a bad product1. Does not fit well into ear2. Keeps slipping out- extremely bad grip3. Sound quality is very very bad4. Noise cancellation is cheap5. Auto cut even when you are using it.
Right side of the earphone not working,1.0,The rigt side of the earphone just does not give any sound output . Suddenly the right side stopped working and even after multiple restarts it just does not work . Everything happening on the 22nd day of delivery (now i can't retrurn) and the usage has been for not more than 10 days for 2-3 hours each . Horrible product and a complete waste of money .
Worst earplugs ...do not buy,1.0,I have two products both stopped working in few months ...neither boat gives service nor Amazon ... please refrain to buy this product it's waste of money..my both products still in warranty .Boat doesn't respond and Amazon says boat will give service.
Defective product,1.0,I got the product Boat rockerz 255 pro + 2 weeks ago... And from last week it is not working properly. Sometimes switching on but never switches off. Whenever I want to switch off both red and blue led glows and never turns off. I am disappointed to get such product from Boat. I doubt whether Boat have any quality check before selling to customers. Never expected such a bad experience with boat product. Don't buy Boat Rockerz 255 pro +.
It is too good but not fully water resistant.,4.0,Sounds are too good actually everything thing is too good but water resistant is not satisfied me because I was travel in cherapuji and in rainy day the Bluetooth was totally wet and next day the Bluetooth was not start when I push the button for start it start and automatically go to off Due to wet I had to dry it in hard sunlight for 3 days
Would advise against it,1.0,"I already use the same earphones and I've used them for two years. Somehow, this product came in with honestly little to zero volume enhancement. I can properly hear music only after using 100% of volume and even then it's less for most songs and videos. Absolutely disappointing. The earpieces are made of bad quality. Would not recommend this product at all."
Warranty claim,1.0,"When I buy this product it shows me 1 year replacement warranty, after using this 7 month one side is not working and I am not able to connect customer service because of lockdown and there is no  option for replacement or warranty claim..."
Spoilt in a week. Replacement got spoilt in a month.,1.0,Got spoilt in a week. Stopped charging. Got a prompt replacement but that also stopped working. Finally I gave up on BOAT vowing never to purchase bluetooth sports headsets. Personally for me bluetooth sports headsets have never worked. I have tried Sony etc but it is never long lasting.
Satisfying product by Boat. long lasting. Thank you üôè,4.0,"1. Sound quality  I have been using this product for 2 months, and today I must share my experience that Sound and bass quality is Above average and It has noise cancellation feature also. 2. Build quality  Easy to handle and use.  I bought it as black colour.. There are more colour here. You can definitely go for this product."
Product worth to buy in this price,5.0,This 255 pro+ bluetooth handsfree is better than boat 335 and sony WI C200Sound quality is goodBoat 335 and wi c200 comes with more treble when 255 pro+ having good sound quality due to equality of Bass and trebleAnd more important battery backupI am using since it's delivered (for more than 24 hours) but charging is still 95% for battery 10/10Good product to buy
Totally disappointed,1.0,Even when i go through comments about this product. Most of them put negative comments. But then also i had a trust in boat products now this changed everything.1).Bluetooth connectivity - sometimes there is a breaking issue eg. When i play a music song break for a millisecond happens for 6-7 times in a single song.2).while calling sound from other side is not so clear.3).Right side portion of this headset have some sound buffering or scattering issue.Overall it is waste of money. I got this product for 999. Still im not satisfied with this. I don't know whether they accept my return request or not.
"No earphone in the package  , only buds, a USB connector and a catalogue.",1.0,"I cannot give a genuine feedback on sound quality, noise cancellation  and all , because , I order this for 1399 , and I received a package with additional buds , a USB connector and catalogues.  This package did not have an earphone in it . So disappointing  . I don't know if it's with the seller or manufacturer, it is so strange to see an empty package from Amazon"
Value for Quality of the Headphone but not for the Sound Quality,2.0,"Hi all,This headphone I have purchased to replace my 'JBL T160 in-Ear Headphones with Mic' headphone with lot of expectations from the Boat. But the sound quality of 'JBL T160 in-Ear Headphones with Mic is much better than the Boat.But the physical quality of Boat is awesome. If u are looking for the best sound quality please dont go for it and if u are looking for the physical quality, Boat is the best under Rs.1,500/-Headphone Quality - ****Sound Quality - **Base - **Battery durability - *** (5Hrs)Value for money - ***Over All I can give THREE STARS for this product"
Avg product or may be even good product for the price.,2.0,"Avg product. Packaging was badly damaged when received, product in working condition. I do not understand why this is so highly rated or has so many ratings may be, they captured the pulse of Indian buyers correctly?"
About Warranty & Servicing,2.0,I buy this product after 3 month one side is not working so i can this warranty on thier website they approved it i have sent my products to their Servicing company mumbai after that no ones did not respond at meThey didn't pick my call they did not send any mail to me my warranty is also about to end i tried 100 call perday no ones didn't pick my call if they pickup they muted ...So this the worst servicing centre i have ever metSorry for my bad english
10 to 30 sec delay in everything,1.0,I just got one delivered there is lag/delay in everything - music games videobuy this earphone only if you wish to see things first and hear them later onThe magnet is a joke you still have to switch on and off the earphone manuallyFor those of you who didn't get it - please buy
Battery dead in three months,2.0,"Within three months of purchase of the item, the battery is dead and doesn't recharge at all. Bogus products being sold on Amazon these days. There seem to be no checks and balances in their system.The product carries a replacement warranty of one year. Wonder whether Amazon will honour it???"
My opinion,3.0,Output sound is extremely loud and high you can't hear in full high volume..Pros-1. Bass is loud and high2. Full volume is extremely high3. Very light weight.4. Fits in ear you can use for long time.Cons-1. Material looks cheap quality(does not matter for me after all sound matters)2. Battery backup is less and indicator is 100 to 80 to 60 to 20 then off.Conclusion- you can go for it if you love high volume with extra bass.
Ultimate product at such a cheap rate.,5.0,Awesome product. Works fantastic. Thanks for giving the freebie. Worth the penny.Pros:Good battery lifeSounds qlty is awesome.Easy to pair and disconnect.Cons:Nothing so far.Would recommend to buy this product as its best in this price range.
And expensive deal,1.0,Though I didn't buy it in prime day sale I am happy with the product and it's sound quality good bass and clear sound. Nice isolation but battery backup could have been better. Build quality is nice. Overall a nice entry level Bluetooth headphoneAfter 6 months the charging port is not working
Boat reall rocks with this specificproduct!!!,5.0,I have been using this product for 2 months now. Battery life is paar excellent. Sound is also good.During the use there is a slight hissing sound which can be ignored!!Overall excellent product under 1500/-
Waste of money üí∞,1.0,Waste of money.... this thing didn't even lasted for a week.. it's not charging and sound quality is poor.. it's been few days that I send it for replacement but I didn't get it still.. don't buy this product... I never expected this kind of bad experience from such a huge company...
WORKS WITH ONLY ONE MOBILE. NOT DUAL MOBILE.,1.0,"Call sound is very clear, no issues. Bass is good. Very disappointed bcuz of not connecting  2 devices in same time. I RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY. Better go with Samsung Level U. If u using only one mobile means, just go with it.UPDATE:After 1 month of using writing this.Please guys do not buy this scrap one. I just throwed it into dustbin.1.  Two devices not connecting in same time.2. Very noise while in call, voice breaking, other end person hears a robot voice3.Last two days I'm facing charging issue. I need to try 15 to 20 timesPLEASE DON'T BUY IT GUYS."
Expected a better quality product from boat but was disappointed.,3.0,"Left side bud is bend downwards which makes it difficult to fit properly in ear. Sound and bass are decent but I am not happy with the noise cancellation. While on call, the person on the other end was not able to hear well even after I had to literally scream. Overall, an average product. It's better to spend a bit more and buy some other brand like Oppo, MI, RealMe etc."
Best Budget Bluetooth Headphones,5.0,It's been more than 10 months I bought these EARPLUGS and i find them the best at such a reasonable price. They actually have noise cancellation feature not to the top most but good at this price. The battery runs for 6-7 hours long once charged fully. Also good quality sound
"Dont Buy,Poor Quality,Worst Service.",1.0,"Very bad product, i wqs fan of boat till i bought this ear phones, i bought two of these ans within 3 months one sidded stopped working of both earphones. I sent for replacement from official sites and they send me msg after 10 months that some guy from courier company will pick up fauly earphones but no one is coming since 10 days after msg, i am continuously calling that xpressbess guy but he answring like i will come this time and that time but he never comes. Worst product, worst service Dont buy."
Worth for the price!üî•,4.0,Serves the purpose well! Sound quality is good though not equivalent to JBL wired headset. But still its worth the price! Got for ‚Çπ999 with additional 10%off over it.Disadvantages:1)Charge gradually drops from 100%-80% but then shows 80% for a long time though the charge is getting reduced and finally it drops to 60-40-20-0 within 5-10 minutes.2)Not suitable while driving in 2-wheeler. (Connection gets dropped often while riding)
Beware! I got duplicate product.,1.0,Very bad quality. The teal green colour is not at all as shown. The shown is very freash and good looking. In actual it is very dull. The sound quality was very bad. I think they have shipped me a duplicate product. As a prime member i am totally disappointed. Worst!!!! I have returned it.
It didn't even last for 3days.,1.0,"It was going exactly so good untill three days.It showed low battery and plugged it in to the charger and since then it is not working.I did not expect this from ""AMAZON"" neither from ""BOAT""The worst part is have misplaced the recieptamd neither do I have the box in which it came..How do I reclaim my headphones.It was excellent the sound quality was very good but the issue which I faved,I never expected this from this company of such high stature.Amazon please look into this matter"
Excellent,5.0,"Wonderful quality, connects seamlessly. Superb bass and audio quality, only thing bothering is a slight hissing background noise during movie playback when connected to TV. Otherwise, this is a wonderful product, slightly overpriced I feel though..."
Bluetooth connectivity issues,3.0,"Sound, noise cancellation, and bass quality all are best ..But problem in Bluetooth connectivityAs per my experience of 1 monthIt's sound comes 1 or 2 seconds late than deviceAnd due to online classes it is automatically switch off and also sometimes sound coming stops automaticallyRest is good product for songs and all things"
Disappointing,2.0,"I received it yesterday, as I wanted a wireless earphones. Quality of sound is just disappointing, so much of bass, it masks all the finer tunes. I am using Sound magic E10c, which in terms of sound quality way ahead of this product. I purchased it in 1199/- in sale (these sales are just selling gimmick,I knew BoAt is just a branding on chinese stuffs like micromax, they can sell their item only on e plateform, still I thought to give it a try."
product with typical one year warranty lasting period,3.0,"Defective piece was delivered at first where one of the side was not working properly. After getting exchanged with new earphone after 1 year, right side was not working  properly and after next 1 month other also got damaged. Overall not a good quality product that can last for a long time. typical one year warranty.(or may be less than that in case of existing defective product)"
Everything is good save that the earbuds are extremely painful,3.0,"The pity is that everything about these earphones are great, starting from the sound quality, the technology/user-friendliness, and even the instructions. But I don't know which genius came up with the earbud designs. They hurt a lot! Unless you insert them deep in your ears you won't really be able to get them to stay on. Inevitably after about 15 minutes of usage, your ears will ache. Therefore even though its a perfectly fine product in all other ways, its not very usable. A great pity."
Light on control buttons should be shifted away from eyes.,4.0,Very good earphones from boat but compare to oneplus it's quality is not good at all. One LED light blinking is irritates specifically in night.Voice and battery is fantasticü§òüòùü§ò. Overall pays for money
Product OK / Poor Customer Service,1.0,The product was good until 10 to 11 months of warranty and then it had worn out. I wrote to the Customer Service / called them but the people who works in their Customer Service does not even value their Customer. I am writing to them for more than 2 months but no single action has been taken as per commitment over the phone. I suggest others to buy some other brand other than boat who might value our money. If boat acts on the same i will update you.
If u r a music lover don‚Äôt buy boat,1.0,"Product is good worth money but if you are a music lover then boat is not a brand I recommend. Sony, jbl, Phillips, have better quality. Battery backup is good."
Not worth buying.,1.0,Sound is not at all balanced. Bass is too loud... All other frequencies are being dominated. Bass is loud but doesn't have quality. Not worth spending 1500/-. Built quality is also decent.I have to tweak Equalizer a lot to get a balance of all frequencies. That's not all... Equalizer need to be changed each time for different types of songs. I am not at all happy to buy this. Wastee of money. I could have added some more amount and should have bought some good brand.
"Worth your money, the battery life is the huge plus",4.0,"If you are not looking for the hassle to charge your headphones once or twice in a day, this is the one! I use it very frequently and have to charge only once for a hour or so every 4-5days.The bass is really good, but only one con is that I won't recommend it for long time usage as it will hurt your ears after after few hours else it's really good from battery and sound perspective"
"Amazing sound quality, perfect noise cancellation",5.0,"Very happy with the sound quality, I am posting this review after using the headset for almost 3 weeks. I am very happy with the battery backup for the headset.Its ligh weight and foldable. Easy to carry in bag without any fear of damage. There are 2 extra pieces of earbuds of different size to fit your ear."
"Waste of money, worked for 7 months",1.0,"Writing the review after 7 months use, the product worked fine initially but after 7 months of use it is not working. We don't pay that much amount for only 7 months use of any product. Warranty is still there but I live in small city, where to go and how to claim the warranty."
No one helping,1.0,"I'm messageing from so many day's no 1helping me for the same of warranty or change the product right one is not working & battery problem also and the main point is on website there's no OPTION AVAILABLE FOR 255 SPORTS WIRELESS guy's 1st check it on website then purchase it bcz of there's so many guy's facing the problems but no one is helping them & one more thing, think before purchasing it see the all Reviews & queries there's no option available 1st buyers see the all Details about it"
Had issues with Bluetooth for both original and replacement order,1.0,Issue remains same with replacement order.Bluetooth gets connected and disconnected within 1 sec. Could not even listen to songs or could call to check mic.Some issue with the blue tooth
Very awesome product even after 9 months of usage,5.0,The product works well even after 9 months of usage. No issues. Battery backup is good and even if it discharges just charge for 5 min and can go for a full movie. Good sound and base quality at this price range. No connectivity issues. Connects to 2 devices simultaneously.
boat Rockerz 255 pro+ handset is not supporting aptx codec.,4.0,"Sound quality is nice, noice cancellation is working perfectly.ye bluetooth handset aptx codec support nahin karta jabki mein jo handset use kar raha hoon usmein aptx ka support hai Mere handset ka model MI note 8 Pro hai Mera version 12 stable hai fir bhi aptx ka support mujhe is boat Rockerz 255 pro+ handset per nahin mil raha box par likhi jankaari galat hai, mujhe esa lagta hai"
Best part battery and worst part connection issue with choppy audio,2.0,Connection problem. Gets disconnected freauently and also choppy audio which is very annoying.. Just battery is best.. I was expecting more then just battery... Audio is ok.. Fitting is good on ur ears but material is hard.. So if u use it for continuous 2 to 3 hours for a movie Or so then u would feel irrition in your ears
Nice headset,5.0,"After a month of using I'm reviewing this, Yeah it's really a good  product. Battery life is also good, Good for listening songs while walking.Satisfied i feel. but if u need to headsets forsinging karaoke, I will not prefer this, otherwise it is awesome..."

Good but not best at price,4.0,"I got a defective unit....... Its not turning one than i tried to connect it to charger and its start working but after removing charger it turned off again.....no sing of any light or anythin......there might a battery issue.....just book a replacement order,  than try its sound qualityEdit-i got replacement....new unit is good but some times i feel disturbance when enjoying music"
Boat wireless earphone stopped working with 2months,1.0,"A very big dislike to this product as I have bought it seeing the brand of this product but unfortunately it had stopped working so soon I mean not properly two months have been passed and it had stopped working and the return policy have also been cancelled so i would request to kindly exchange my product that is boat company's wireless earphone that costed me 1499 , to either exchange my product or return and cashback me"
Irresponsible service but boat,1.0,"Ordered during great Indian sale, after 10 days one side stopped working so I registered a complaint on the boat official website after one week they replaced the product with a brand new one but the model they gave was the pro version not the one I purchased. I reported this to their e-mail but got no satisfactory response."
Don't buy,1.0,"It was good quality when i was start using, then audii quality decreased, then i have contacted support and they have informed me they will pickup product.. but they didn't do anything"
Awesome product‚ô•Ô∏èüëå,5.0,I am writing this review after 1 week.I love this product very muchüòòthank you flipkart and boat for lovely productüëè. YouCan buy this does not a worryüëå.

Awful Product,1.0,"Actually I ordered through Amazon so,no problems with Amazon but the product is infinite times negative.I already used this product last 6 months onwards it got replaced once because left ear phone was working.Even though they replaced it again behaves like that only now both the ear phones are not working so,when I contacted boat once again they told me that I got replaced once second time wouldn't possible for me to complaint against.Overall,I will tell you to go for some branded products like Skullcandy,Seiheiser,RHA,JBL  etc.,don't buy these worst products as they don't told me exact problem what happened with ear phone."
Good Sound; Bad for Running,3.0,"I wanted something to replace my TomTom's bluetooth ear phones (ah, how I miss them).  While the sound quality is way better then what I derived from TomTom's original set, but boat Rockerz are heavy, bouncy and needs your attention all the time while running. The heavy arms are probably the reason for  delivering the sound quality and longer battery life, but they surely are not for runners."
Surprised with so many positive reviews,2.0,"First time a boat product has disappointed.Battery lasts for less than a day, although when I use it for not more than an hr a day.Not comfortable on ears m, sound quality is okay.Overall okay product. Think before buying"
Good aound quality.. But long cable,4.0,"Good sound quality. Crystal clear sound. The product is fit to the ears very exactly. Very good noise cancellation. Easy to commect via BT. Only problem faced ia its long cable when not fitted into ear. The cable is fit when used in the ear otherwise when hanging through the neck, its very longer"
Not so good,4.0,"Buds are not get fits in ear, also magnet lock feature is not properly works."
Stopped working after 3 months,2.0,"It‚Äôs my second pair of boat rockers. I bought both based on the good reviews but both of mine have stopped working after 2-3 months. After the second one stopped working I came to the conclusion that I won‚Äôt be buying this brand again, and would recommend against it to others who want to have decent quality earphones that work fir mire than a few months"
"""Good Bass"" & reasonable price",4.0,Got a good deal of rs 800.. it delivered on time. Build quality is good and sits perfectly on your ears. Good bass & 70% noise cancellation. Voice clarity is good when using for calling.Packaging could have been a little sturdy.Overall good product in this price range. Thanks Amazon & ‚õµ üòä
Good quality product,5.0,Product stands and works good for price 999/-Charging time last for 4-5hrs in continuous usage.Bass is high even for non-bass audio/video.Call calrity is OK but not experiencing impressive noise cancellation while on calls. Must buy to enjoy bass music in this price range üëç
my review after 2 month usage,5.0,"Hello i am ramesh. i am using these bluetooth for 2 months.pros1.sound quality superb.2.bass is excellent.3.Best budget earphones4. charging is good. For full charge it will take 1.5 hours . It lasts for one 7 hours if we use continuouslycons wires are large given it would be nice if wires are small. It is not good for running as well since there is shaking in wires, it feels little bit discomfort while running or jogging. It is the only con i have noticed."
Dual Connectivity Issue,3.0,I am still not able to use the dual connectivity feature. If I try to connect it with laptop or phone and if it is already connected with one of them it diesn‚Äôt let me connect with other device. It looks like doesn‚Äôt support dual connectivity.
Bad noise cancellation n not comfortable,3.0,I'm writing this after using it 3 or 4 months ...This is very good budget earphone also sound battry is excelente but biggest problem is noise cancellation feature is useless in crowd other side of personal in phone call can't even listen your voice which is very irritating n aslo if you used it for 1 or 2 hours it is so painful ...So overall these 2 are major problems
Boat Rockerzzzz !!,5.0,Awesome product for the price paid. The battery backup is decent with up to 4 days from full charge (usage of 1 hr per day). Sound quality is too good. Only disadvantage is that the battery percentage shown on mobile is for a long time 80%. And suddenly it drops to 20%. The backup is good but the status shown is not correct.
Costly but worth of it.,4.0,The battery life is quite good as i am using it for past 10 days and charged it only twice. As i am not that rough user it's battery life is reliable. Sound and bass are awesome. Let's how many days it can go on without any problem. I tried to activate the warranty but it didn't get activated don't know why ? .
Excellent Earphonesüëå,5.0,"Awesome Bass üëåüëå, Sound quality is good üëç..Better Noise cancellation, It's water resistant, but not waterproof.Batteryüîã Backup is Good nearly 6-7 hrs.Value for Money. Build quality is Nice..Overall Good Headset..Thanks to Amazon for giving me Best price!!"
Durable Design,4.0,"This is my 7th product from 'boat' and i am clearly impressed. Apart from 2 wrong purchases, all the other products have been working really well.  The best part about this product specifically is its durability which is much better than other brands  at this price. so Go for it."
Nice & clear sound; great bass and decent price!,5.0,"These are a decent pair of earphones at the given price. I have earlier used the Skullcandy and the JBL earphones and compared them, this is not a disappointment at all.The sound quality, clarity and bass are quite good. The quality of voice, when using for phone calls, is pretty nice too.The battery lasts for little more than six hours on continuous use after a single charge.I would highly recommend these earphones."
Best in budget,4.0,"It has been a month since I got these earphones and these are my first own Bluetooth earphones. However, I have tried many other earphones and headphones from different brands from my friends like boat, Samsung, sony, Skullcandy, jaybird, house of marley. I finally settled for this one because it's giving more than it's worth when compared to others. These are cheap in cost and rich in sound. Casual music listeners will enjoy this earphones thoroughly.I will list some pros and cons that a casual music lover looks for...Pros :1)Deep boosted bass and balanced music at higher volumes...worth for money2)Good fit, Light weight and flexible neck band with sweat and water resistant... perfect for workout3)Around 6 hours of play time at 80% of full volume and around 1.5 hour for full charge4) multi function buttons and different bud sizesCons....1) little noise at the beginning that fades out as soon as the music starts2) disconnection ( lag in music ) due to displacement of device for the first time only. It gets settled after the first time you move it and stays connected with out any further disruption."
Good Sound Performance compared to Wired JBL C200Si and Sennheiser MX 170,4.0,"This Boat Rockerz 255 is my first Purchase of Bluetooth Headphone and I found this better in terms of Sound performance than JBL C200Si and Sennheiser MX 170 which I have been using for quite some time. The Bass is very immersive and Lows / Mid are crystal clear. Treble is controlled and is balanced. This Boat Rockerz 255 beats the JBL & Sennheiser wired headphones that cost around Rs. 800-900. AT Boat Rockerz @ Rs.899/- is a great deal. Must buy, Boat Rocks......"
Worst headset i ever bought,2.0,Boat rockers 255 Sportz headset the sound is really good but what happened with in 2 months right speaker was not audible and the sound was too low and bluetooth connective also not upto the mark. In this it has mentioned it covers about 10mts but even 5mts you could hear the breakage of the voice. So my thing please don't buy and waste your money. Battery standby 6hrs if you continuously hear the video song or playing games. else only audio means 10hrs. But the bass sound is good. If you get the good one instead of defective piece then you can enjoy the nice music.
Really a good product for bikers value of money üíµ,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Before I purchase boat neck band I use many types of earphones and neckband but this product is fill my desires..I suggest you try this it's really cool look and special for bikers it's comfortably fit in helmet .."
Overallt. Build quality is outstanding.,4.0,"I mentioned above only bass is not much more or as per my expectations as I am bass lover with great combination. Boat rockerz was not suitable for  so I given to my daughter and she is happy with this one. Because this excellent product in sound, build quality and price also, as I had purchased it in 899/- So now I can say everything is excellentüëçüëç."
Very Good Earphones with good battery life,5.0,Battery life is more than enoughEasy to use.....connectivity range is awesomeIdeal for online classes and long music sessionsSound quality and clarity as well as the bass is greatMic could have been a little betterBuilt quality is decentFlat cables makes it even strongerOver all I would give the earphones 4.7/5
This product never disappoint me till now.,5.0,"Sound Quality is very good and I actually loved it because of its battery backup on a single charge I use it for two days, which is very fascinating and also it recharges very fastly.If I talk about sound Quality then as company promises it has boat signature sound with proper stereo but bass is little bit low besides this you gonna enjoy it .....very nice product at this price."
Good product,4.0,The product design and usability is very good. Recieved in good condition. Noise cancellation is good enough although not working in trains. I bought it for running purpose and it doesnt quite satisfy it. The ear buds keep on falling away when you run. Tried adjusting it but still it‚Äôs the same.
Sound quality is good but build quality is average,4.0,"Review after 3 months of usage.It has  good sound quality and battery back up is amazing. Normal usage battery lasts for days. But comparing to oneplus bullet , boat rockers build quality is very poor and comfort to wear is not that good. Seems a bit bulky.If u want a good battery life and sound quality but ready to compromise on comfort you can go for it."
Boat Rockerz 255Pro+,5.0,"Everything is Perfect and Sound Quality improves as per the Mobile you own.  It has upto Aptx support... If ur device has Only SBC, it works on SBC. If  your Phone supports  AAC, then the headset adopts to AAC. If u have Aptx codec , it adopts to Aptx..!! Everything is good. And Really an Amazing Backup of 40Hrs. I haven't charged it from the day i received.  Of course 3days passed..  Hence i am a soft user of 4 - 5 hours per day... A good product and go for it .. !!"
Best product,5.0,Go for it. One of the best in the segment. Great background noise cancellation. Perfect bass.If boat could provide quick charging and magnetic controls along with this product it could make the perfect choice.
Worst service from boat and Amazon itself for the very first time,1.0,Earphone does have very low range connectivity. I don't think so it's noise cancellation have more than 20% capacity. After using it for some days it's speaker gave up and gives some very irritating sound.When I tried to file a complaint on boat website for this then I saw that the product name is not there. What the heck? Even no call support without submitting the issue on website. I don't how am I suppose to contact submit the warranty claim if the website is not showing their own brand name of the product. Nice boat and Amazon. Keep it up in making customers fool. üòêüòê
very good product in this range,5.0,"I purchased this item 2 months back, and it cost me around 250 rupee after cashback. And in this range this is the best wireless earphone.Battery - around 7 8 hours.Connectivity - You can connect 2 device at a time (phone and laptop).bluetooth range- Range is very good I used in 3 bhk flat and its good after moving in other rooms.Noise Cancellation - tested using the bike and other side there in no noise of the traffic and all.Quality - Sound and build quality is very good.Overall very good earphone. Good to go with it in this price range."
Annoying announcement voice & Cracked voice,1.0,"The earphones produce a cracked voice and the announcements are annoying and weirdly phrased. It does not say which device it is connect to, rather says ""Connected to Boat Rockerz 255 Pro""That is the worst promt ever!!"
Cheap headphones not worth even 500.,1.0,"Got it for 999 during a flash sale.The left earphone stopped working properly within a week. Got it replaced.. Thanks to amazon.The replacement is even worse. The battery dies down within 2 hrs of usage. And to top it off, the boat support is being handled by idiots who say that battery damage isn't covered under warranty. Even when i mentioned this is a new earphone hardly used for a week, the answer is same.So just stay away from boat products however lucrative the deal might be."
Awesome earphone,4.0,"I got this on 27 Mar21, before expected date. I am using this earphone since 2 days & only 40% battery discharged...battery backup is awesome... Rest are also superb...I recommended it...go for it without wasting time...Awesome bluetooth earphone..Thank you Amazon.."
Don't buy this.,1.0,"This wireless headset stopped working after one month. I used it only in my home, so it was handled properly without any water or other kind of damages. Suddenly one day it stopped working but charging functionality was working perfect. This headset was fully charged still i can't power it on by pressing it's power button. In service centre they told me the internal IC is damaged anyhow so that's why it's not working."
Go for it without a doubt!,4.0,"Awesome product at this price..the sound quality is very nice, noise cancellation is very effective which makes it very useful for those who use it while travelling. The ear support curve is very comfortable, you can use it for hours without having any pain in the nearby area. Overall good product, stand very high amonst his peers."
Wow Aswome,5.0,I useing this earphones along 3 month.i could except this kind of profomance. No lack No issue face during useing.Sound quality is awsome but vocal sound nedded improve.Bass is outstanding and clear is awsome.Noise cancellation is good but needed more imrove. Overall it is the best neckband for beginners. I must satisfy with this earphone and i gave a gift to my friend. üòçüòçüòçüòç
Bad microphone but good sound quality,3.0,"Except for the microphone which is really bad,  it's a good buy if you are primarily buying it fit listening to music or watching videos on your phone.If your usage is for attending regular calls and telephonic meetings, don't go for it!"
Best deal I purchased 999,4.0,My 1st Bluetooth purchase from Amazon and like it very much. I was using it but some where I lost it üòî but I really like it. I did not feel it's has some noise cancellation feature bcoz every time I am facing this issue. If I am talking to someone then I have switche off Bluetooth. But very soon I am going to order another one üòÇ bcoz I am a music lover and I found Bluetooth headphones are best for my phone (OnePlus 7t).
Perfect Buy,4.0,"very nice product, im waiting since long time for the price dropüòãüòãüòãüòãsound quality, bass quality is awesome, music lovers will definately enjoy 100%Noise cancellation is very perfect, as i talk many calls on ride, and there is no problem for other side for the noise.perfect buy"
Teal green colour looks old and faded,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†The packaging was bad, but the product was somehow not damaged, so i have not returned it,Other than that, sound quality is great, used for like 3 weeks now at gym and no issues, playback time is good,, charging time is low, negligible sound lag while playing freefire, teal green colour looks like a old one, kind of faded, other than that its a great buy"
Ridiculous Bass,3.0,"FOr the price of Rs: 1000, build quality is below par. Bass is too much pumped up. It irritates someone who listens to classical/Jazz. Make sure you have the equalizer adjusted to your needs."
Worst customer service by boat. Not happy,2.0,Boat rokerz 255 is truly amazing in terms of sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity.I ordered the earphones in January 19. It worked really well for 10 months. But one earphone stopped working because of loose connection in the cable from last month. I tried to register the complaint. It showed error. I tried calling the customer care many times. No one picked up the call. Very bad service. Product is under warranty. But no use.
Best in this budget,5.0,"Brought it after reading all the other reviews in the internet and I have no regrets purchasing this product. Works just as mentioned, very good sound quality, comes with noise cancellation, and plus point is for all the bass lovers yes it has got decent bass quality, with 10mm driver."
boat bluetooth neckband not switch offing automatically when we connect earbud magnets,3.0,Mainly it's not automatically offed by attaching earbud magnets we should switch off the main button every time that's a main mistake in this neckband & battery time is low sound quality is good but woofer is disturbing that sound quality mainly this Amazon people is not giving refund when we don't like product so best to purchase outside because we can check there.
useless product don't purchase.,1.0,"worst of product weast of money,  i have purchased this hear phones 5 months back now both the speakers not working. i had raised the ticket for the same but no use.. several times i am trying to reach out custumer support not answered.Finally i realised that purchasing this kind of products weast of money and time spending to order this."
Replacement policy only for Manufacturing Defect.,1.0,"Product is superb, but after 4 months of normal use right side ear piece stopped working.I tried to contact Boat Service Centre in Chennai for a replacement, they rejected my request because they can assure replacement warranty only for manufacturing defects. Then why Boat provides such a 1 year replacement warranty.My device is in the same condition how I received it. No water or moisture contact, No breakage of the body or wire parts."
Not Bad for the Price,3.0,"I've been personally using higher quality headphones; so the sound quality of these earphones have felt pretty bad, in comparison. The sound quality for the price though, is pretty good, especially for a set of wireless earphones. There was almost no lag, so, would work with casual video viewing and gaming."
Overall not bad,4.0,"I purchase it in DecemberDurability okBass over bass but no disturbanceSound quality good some unique sounds missingComfort ok but some problems my ear is not  comfortablee with it i used all buds Control some times calling is not workingGaming ,in cod the sound effect is take some time difference whike compared to wire headphones"
Worth of money and quality,4.0,*I am using this for past 20 days*  1 battery backup is good enough we get almost 6 to 8 hrs of battery life which depends on ur usage2 sound as lik boat never let us down on sound quality bass is always awesome as well as vocal quality also3 product  quality is good when we wear its not heavy4 it is not recommended for pubg never buy if u wanna use if for pubg u will get sound lag
Don't think just buy boat.,4.0,"Call quality is not that good the only problem i face with this product.I love boat when it come to music the quality is amazing, i used most of evey product from boat speakers, earphones, powerbank, neckband, car chargers. And they impress me every time."
BETTER THAN THE BEST :- ITS WORTHY OF THE REMARK :- NEXGEN TRENDSETTER,5.0,"The boAt Rockerz 255, while being lightweight in design pumps out the favourite tunes with powerful HD sound and deep boosted bass.It can differentiate music from noise.An exceptional sound experience with articulate audio reproduction with a blend of pitch perfect frequency response.According to me everything is awesome except one thing :-The cover of the charging port.By any means if it tear aparts then I think it's very tough to fix it up again in the same place. Maybe fevikwik can fix it but do not try this.Hope that moment will never come because it depends on how you use it. Overall product quality is just mesmerizing."
Very long lasting battery with very high quality sound,5.0,Very long lasting battery with very high quality sound. I was fed up of charging again and again to previous mivi earphone. This has everything with awesome battery life. Just make sure you change with a very low voltage charger with the given cable to increase the life of any wireless earphones.
Earphone disconnects from bluetooth very frequently.,3.0,"Writing this after 2 months of usage.Sound quality is good, noise cancellations is kinda ok coz whenever i talk from outside environment, the other person use to complaint about worst background noise.The main issue is nowadays am facing is earphone disconnects from bluetooth suddenly and  often while audio / video is playing. This is so irritating that suddenly if bluetooth disconnect mobile speaker enables which disturb others."
Not very good according to price,3.0,"Built up quality is bad üëéSound quality is ok but not very good according to price,  sound and mostly built up quality should had been more convincing"
Pathetic service,1.0,"Please do not buy this product , my complaint number is 881765, in a month it stopped working, i returned it and when i got the replaced one the ear plugs were not fitted with the product, i raised a request for ear plug i got ear plug which does not go in to the socket. Imagine marketing which took the complaint even the image which i had sent with the email they didn't bother to check the size of the ear plug whether it will fit the device or not. Worst worst service, will never buy boat again n will recommend same to everyone who i meet."
Worth buying,5.0,Its overall sound quality is great. I feel the bass of these earphones is little bit mudy. But its reasonably good. If you are a bass lover then this is for you. You get no complaints in its calling quality as well. Also this product is a beast when it comes to battery. And the build quality of this product is also good.
Best earphones in all aspects.,5.0,"Very good product.everything is good about it...sound quality,bass,noise cancellation, voice during call, battery and price (1499‚Çπ). I have previously used 255F pro,it has good quality sound but battery backup and call quality was lower.But in 255F pro+,those problems has been resolved.Bass is perfect for music lovers upto 70% volume."
Overall value for money product,4.0,Sound quality is good. But if you are in outdoor then it becomes noisy and people keep complaining that ambient sound is audible not my voice. Battery backup is okay if you don't use it continuously throughout the day. Bluetooth connectivity is good not the best because if phone is very near then it's okay or else it will create disturbance if you move to next room.
Worth buying compared to other bluetooth headphones,5.0,"good quality light weight . Long battery backup.  So far I have used this for more than 20 days,  I have not faced any battery issues.  If you use only to answer the call then u will get 8hrs approx backup and music backup may vary as per ur usage.  Very good sound quality.  This is my second Bluetooth headset"
one side not working,1.0,"i am ordered 29 September 2019,still know a day (22-05-2020) its working proper,but today its one side not working,my frnd also buy this same product but that boat also after 4 month not working one sideand no customer care service provide for that productone year warranty are fake commitment,dont buy this product,i am suggested for realme  headset working and looking so good.but anyway amazon side good support"
Wonderful purchase,5.0,"Overall the built quality of the product is good ...Sound quality is decent .. sometimes it seems that it is little bit slow ..Overall it was a good purchase..üòÄBattery üîã backup is good .. works for 2-4 days on single charge, moderate usage ..."
PLEASE DONT BUY,3.0,Really very very bitter experience to use it... when i bought it i thought no doubt it will be superb ... but after used its so pathetic to me... coz it hurts my ear for taking only more than 5 min ... & sound like so so.... not so good... now its very hurt coz i purchase this product for rs.1499/- & now its only 999/-. i bought this ghatia product wid more price for rs.500/-... i HATE boat brand....
Buy it ... Nice and durable quality bluetooth earphones,5.0,"Nice decent quality earphones, battery last almost 8-10 hours of usage, quality sound with good base, good bluetooth range, the wires are good (not as thin as others ones) and the collar part is hard... Overall durable...but I found the earbuds a light hard in initial few uses..... One should definately consider buying these bluetooth earphones!"
"Great sound, good treble, good bass",4.0,"This is one of those Bluetooth earphones whose bass i liked. I have tried boult audio, jbl earphones but in this price range, boat beats both of them.The sound quality is awesome, treble is also good. Bass is also good but i expected better bass, but as i said it's worth the price. Of the few other brands price of which are <=2000, this beats them all in every aspect. Built quality is premium."
worst product,1.0,"we used this product only 4 month, after that one side not working, and i claimed warranty they collect my product immediately 7 month over still i didn't receive the product.better don't buy this product, because my friend also facing same issue.i didn't expect this type of service provided by boAt.Worst service, while we try to call the customer service and believe me we wait 3 hrs to contact the customer servicer but no one listening to our issue.we have lot to complain about it but this is not a right place."
Very Bad,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†After using 6 months.it is not charging when I kept for charge.even red light aslo not coming on neckband.Very bad Experience with Boat Roackerz neck band..for this I spent 1099rs.There is no service center and I don't know how to repair this. Kindly help and replace it.or else please send me service centers list as well customer care number"
Charging cable is damaged,3.0,I doubt whether they perform quality check. The charging cable received with the headset is damaged. See the images. Although I manage with a different charger.Volume is good. Noise cancellation works perfectly. I can record my audio by sitting in a noisy room & it captured only my speech.

"Good one, Best in budget",5.0,This product is very good in this price range. Specially i wanted a good neckband and i am glad that i got this one.  I highly recommend you this. Also the battery backup is nice. 8 hours it will go easily. Charging time is also good in 1 hour. Battery 8 hours is enough for normal use for a day.
Nice product... Nice design,4.0,"Everything is ok... And when we travel on bike it come off from our neck that's the drawback and some noise heard when we talk on phone. Connection is good, sound quality is good compared to this boat earphones are much more better."
I have been using the boat for three years I am satisfied.now purchased another one.,5.0,I have been using the boat for three years I am satisfied.  Improving the quality of the rubber strip attached to the ear and increasing the magnetic force is much more better.
Overall Good,3.0,"Pros - Its Great product with great Sound Quality, Bluetooth Connectivity.Cons - Noise cancellation is worst, Other person on call get every single sound of surrounding except the person who is speaking :),And After use of 6-7 month Sided earphone then is complained and get it replaced but again after use of 3-4 months same issue reoccurred. So you can assume your earphone has got life until it has warranty."
Don't buy this product total waste of your money .,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I have buy this product on 23rd of June 21 and  after first charge that is not working . Total waste money and when I called to amazon customer support they told me we can not return or replace this product due to window closed. That is the build quality of product just in 7 days it's not working. So please buy another other earphone insted of this."
Boat Bluetooth device very poor service and product,1.0,Very bad product. Service is very poor. My device was not charging and great difficulty one support CENTER got it in Basavangudi.But so pathetic if you have everything they will find something to proof for not giving warranty . Final I had to pay Rs550/- for only not having charger rubber cover on it.lot of customers was unhappy on that day in that CENTER because rude behaviour and not supporting customer. Please do not buy boAT  Product and save your money .
Value for money,4.0,Have been using this for more than 2 months. Sound quality is good but still not the best. Its designed ergonomically. The ear buds are soft and comfortable. The Don't expect battery back up for more than a day. Value for money if the shelf life is more than 2 years
"Not good for talking,poor Bluetooth voice connectivity",2.0,"I am not satisfied with the product. It's earplugs are too subtle and piercing. Bluetooth connectivity also not very good and not suitable for considerable distance. Overall it's ok for listening to songs and watching OTT content but not for talking. Also long usage might cause irritation in ears. Amazon is not returning the product also,only replaceable, for the first time I am not satisfied with Amazon."
Value for money,5.0,"I love this product, value for money, I have been using so many earphones with different brands, but this product beat them all, very good sound quality at low and mid volume, light weight, easy to wear, comfort to wear for long time, an hour charge give 2 days usage, long connection range. Built quality is also good.Design can be improved."
"Great for outdoors & indoors, but not for calls.",5.0,"Noise cancellation herein refers to outside noise being cancelled to the one who's hearing. While being on a call, if you try to speak something, your voice would be 20% & the outside voice would be 80%. Solution to this is taking the mic close to your mouth as you speak.Otherwise, sound quality is 10/10."
"what we need  we need powerful performance that makes the brand popular, so it does.",4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Battery backup and build quality is superb. Noise cancellation is ok. It would be better if the charging port is present on either side of the bigger end of the neckband. And there is need for some improvement in bass sound quality. After all at this price range there is no other competitor to compare it. This one is a true winner without any objections."
Best in 1300 rs üíØüëåüôå‚ù§,5.0,Best bluetooth  earphones  under 1500For bass and battery lover butWhile not recommended  for best build quality and top sound qualitySound is good  üëç but hiss sound is play allTime in background  when you are listeningAny contentPlay any music content in zero level and playAnd pause music several  time you absolutelyNote the hiss sound.

Waste of money,1.0,Writing reveiw after 3 months of use1.Battery back up is not good ( hardly works for 2-3 hrs)2.Price is high3.volume buttons will change the audio or video4.not comfortable on ears as well as on neck
Only  show piece,1.0,"Don't  purchase  this  product , it is only show piece , nothing  is there , no bass quality. No vocal , no sound quality  , if you are planning  to purchase  this one its mean you are wasting  your hard  earning  money.  If you will think why i am not returning  this product  because  last time i purchased boat 225 that one not working properly  so i returned  that and in turn they  gave a check of duschat  bank which is not is my city  so conclusion  is don't  waste money in low product"
Affordable headphones,4.0,I recently purchased this product during the prime day sale for RS 1000. I already had Boat Rockerz 295 and purchased 255.. audio wise its too good !! And regarding noise cancellation its better than 295 along with neck pad which wasn't available in 295.The main drawback is.... The length of the headphones are long which looks to be awkward and the wires are slimmer than 295. you need to be careful so that the wire doesn't get cut ! If in case you goin to use these headphones during driving 2 wheelers.... It's goin to hurt ur ears as the earpiece is big and will hurt when you wear helmetI would give 4 out of 5 only because of the above drawbacks !Boat is reliable even if they are given at less price
Best in affordable price range,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Battery is biggest in this catagory... Actually gives 40 hours backup once charged fully.. But earbud doesn't fit properly.. And bass is not up to the mark..."
Decent product with basic use. Don't expect wonders.,3.0,"My previous wireless headphones from Boat lasted for a year and were of same model. However, the recent purchase I was a bit disappointed. Not only did the built quality seems to have detoriated but also the sound quality is not that great. At high volumes the sounds breaks.The connectivity is however good. I have not experienced any call drops. However, quality of call has been an issue"
Style not suitable for workout sessions!,2.0,"The earphone is fine. The wire is way too long which is annoying during worouts. The wire at the neck is way too thick. Seems like wearing a hairband around the neck. I do not like it for that reason. It will just keep shifting from one side to another and will distract you during workouts.Dound quality is good. However, the bluetooth range is not so good. It starts to disconnectent while moving in the gym from one side another."
Not a bad,2.0,No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.
Expect battery but do not expect other,1.0,"This is a genuine review Expect battery but do not expect noice cancellation, I brought it to use while driving but very bad opponent cannot hear my voice, earphones are 1000 percent better than bluetooth, connectivity also some what bad and delay in connectivity while online calling like what's app,Viber."
WORST SOUND QUALITY,1.0,"Magnetic is not proper, noise option is worst.The call sound is very poor.Headset having many issue in very short term period.Kindky don't buy this worst product..it's not worth for money...This product have create a bad idea about boat.Kindly stop the product otherwise... boat is not more for any customers choice.THANKS!"
Below Average & a Trap Don't go for it.!!!,2.0,"Over all it is a below average product.-Very uncomfortable in my ear, painful after 15-20mins only.-Sound quality is very low and not clear many a time.- Bass is ZERO.-As you can see in the picture, it is on charging so frequently.- and the WORST part is; you are not allowed to return it even you want to replace it Amazon will replace it with the same product, why the hell I'll order the same product again with so many flaws.Amazon atleast allow me to pick other product."
Ok the product is good.,3.0,Boat bluetooth ear phones are good enough in its price segment.1. The other person feels we are speaking some far away distance.2.the bluetooth some times fails to connect with mobile phone. (For 100 times approximately 10times it fails to connect)Apart from these 2 issues. The product performs well.

Extremely Good product,4.0,"*Sound is very clear, definitely you'll love enjoying music.*Mic is also awesome, with in 10-15 metre range there is no disturbance.*For this price it is worth buying*Since the earphone is in the ear type, first time users may feel little bit discomfort while initial using but later you will get used to it.Good sound quality 8/10Awesome bass 10/10Decent battery life 7.5/10Build and design 9/10Worth the price 10/10Overall 9/10"
3 out of 5,2.0,I bought the product on 12th August .it was a great product . the sound quality was great the base was good I had little issues with the connectivity but not that much. But now after 6 months one side of the earphone is not working I don't know why but that's really frustrating as the company claims 1 year warranty . In my opinion the design is not that great and the build quality is just 3 out of 5.so if you are planning to buy this please take care of this and do not put it in your bag or something like that as it may get damaged
Above avg product,4.0,"It is above average product, little uncomfortable also to plug in ears due to its design. But it does it‚Äôs job. Am using it to watch TV using fire stick."
Excellent product from boat,5.0,"Review after 15 days of usage - The Bluetooth connectivity is awesome. Never faced any pairing issues and range is approximately 5 to 8m (from one bedroom to next) after that disconnected.Sound quality is good, bass is OK.. Not that much in comparison with boat extra bass wired headphones.Using it during travelling in trains buses.. Nl issues"
Guys product seems  good but not supported Redmi Note 7 and  Redmi Note 8,5.0,"Guys, I did quite an investigation and found this product is not working with the latest Redmi phone. I have 2 phone s (Redmi Note 7 and  Redmi Note 8) which unable to identify when we ON the Bluetooth, did troubleshooting but it's painful to return the headphone..Saved your time or change your mobile phone"
Pathetic product,1.0,This is the pathetic product. Don't waste your money on this. The sound quality is not good. Even connection with Bluetooth have problems. It disconnect automatically when device is next to you. Purchasing this product is waste of your money.
AMAZING PRODUCT  ‚ô°-I LOVE IT-‚ô°,5.0,"AMAZING earphones I love it sound quality bass quality everything thing is amazingbattery backup is also good ut take only 2 hrs. n 7 or 8 hrs. but mine is run for 2 3 days üòÇbecause I don't use n the looküî•i ordered real green this one is litüî•NOTE:- if the battery is below the 60% u can only use it of  the calls.for listening music ,playing games etc. your battery should be more the 60%.GO FOR IT NICE PRODUCT IN rs.1600/-"
Don't buy if you are buying it for make phone calls purpose.,3.0,This product is good for listening music but when when you make a call. The voice breaks a lot and need to disconnect bluetooth to talk to someone.Useless product to  make phone calls.
Best best !!!!!! Bhai leloooo akhee band karke,5.0,"One of the best earphones I ever had, actually it's building quality is quite satisfactory, close your eyes and bye it, outstanding battery backup , bass quality is outstanding , of course u can dissolve urself in world of music for quite a time, ignoring bak bak of ur gf ( if live in ) , also I use it mainly for workout ( gf jaisi kismat kaha bhai ) and u can sweat as much as u want as its water resistant which makes it unique. Go ahead.!"
Quantity is number one priority.,5.0,Great sound quality and bass was purely classic with this price it is great product from great brand.Durability look good let's see in long term i gifted this to someone so i can't tell you about battery life but i tried this once for its condition and I'm in love with this I'll buy for myself too
Best in the range.,5.0,So I have been using them since 3 months.Nice built and cancels noise upto good extreme.Bass is fantastic.As per some reviews they said that phone calls were not clear enough but I don't have any issue regarding that.It's pretty much clear and audible.3 months down the lane and they're good to go.
Good product.. good battery life too,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Good one... I had ordered one previously which was v.bad so had to return it... Was scared to order it again thinking i would get a damaged one this time too.. but this time i got a perfect one and it's really vry vry nice.. vry good battery life... Charges really quick .. sound quality is also good and received in a good packaging.. so overall a nice decent product"
Got issues within 24hrs... Returned,1.0,Got this product from amazon but replacing it with 24hrs as bluetooth stop working..I had to keep my phone about half hand distance for Bluetooth to connect.. Sound quality and look n feel is awesome..hoping to get a replacement with a defect free product. Got a replaced one and returing that eithin 10 days as bluetooth stoped working
Reconsider your decision if you are excited about this product,1.0,"Overall one of the worst product I have come across... This is the replacement product because 1st one was not working properly( voice level in 2nd side was too low). I was hoping that replacement product will be a good one but what?? I called my brother and can not listen to him, he is also not getting my voice. Tried so many calls but result was same.. Extremely disappointed with Amazon service and boAt product first time.. Going to post review on social media(Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc) and on some websites as well.. A very very disappointing product. Will try to not buy anything from Amazon after this incident.Goodbye Amazon.in"
It's good,5.0,"Fits perfectly.i am using it for more than an hour and is still very comfortable.red colour looks nice.Music sound is pretty good.bass little high.when you play a song you can't hear a thing from your surroundings,though I've not tried it in crowded place.call quality is good.bluetooth range is not upto the mark.priced around 900 during GIS makes it more worthy.Overall i am happy with my purchase."
When start the offer if you buy,4.0,I bought the product and use 1 years then I written review. Sound quality is good something problem in flex cable you can try to hurt if you broke the flex cable. When you're using please scary use it is my requirement and the product is so good you can use for your sport.
Good product but lack other qualities,2.0,Good product but mic is not good other person doesn't listen voice clearly. Also there is no vibration when call is coming. After a while battery backup is not good. After 20% it started to sound for battery charge. Also design is not good you cannot do any kind of exercise using this product. I think you should prefer to buy boat other model.
Fantastic Product for the Price,5.0,The audio quality is clear. Sound amplification is fantastic. Adequate noise cancellation. Bluetooth connectivity is fine within a range of 5 meters. Overall a good purchase.
Worth the money,5.0,"It's good go for it for a medium budget headphones.Fitting is good, doesn't come out of ears try shaking your head as hard as you can.. LolOn neck is light weight doesn't feel anything.Charging n backup are also superb.I charge for 3 hours and mostly gives a playback almost 2 days"
Excellent Bluetooth Wireless,5.0,For the price this is the best.Excellent quality and battery life. On a single charge I can go anywhere between 6-8 Hours based on the usage.CON: I wish there was a proper carrying case for this.
Overall good impression in this particular price segment.,5.0,"Sound quality - GoodComfort - AverageLooks - Average(Because the wire is not rounded, but it doesn't cause any issue)Battery Life - BestCharging time - BestDual connect - Average(can be improved, but in this price segment it is nearly the  max you can get)Water-proofing - Haven't tested but I hope it's IpX7 works. Overall a happy purchase for me :)"
Not great. But manageable,3.0,Really not worth the expectations they showcase. Battery runs out quicker than what I'd expect it to stay. Sound quality is not worth its competitors at its range. Calls via bluetooth has a bit of a lag and noise. But overall it is usable if u plan not to use it more than half an hour a day.
Good product,5.0,"Excellent product. Sound quality is pretty good, and paired with my phone pretty quickly. Just now trying to connect with second device. Couldn't connect it yesterday.Amazon delivered the package on time, and packing was also decent.So overall, product is very good, light weight too. So you hardly feel the weight of it on the neck Will post after use review in some days."
Good product but stops working very soon,5.0,This is my third bluetooth int his year. You can call this it's negative feature that they are so fragile.same problem occured everytime.it stopped charging. Or can call this it's positive feature that I come back to buy this everytime as no other bluetooth provides such good mic.
About the quality of product,3.0,Approximately good products for middle class but some demerits also in this products joint on charging point and key has open but i repair those by tape and also locking systems are not good...this not for sports men
Very good product,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Very good product i am a happy and bass quality is goodHurrey"
Great Buy,5.0,Good quality stuff for the offfered price.Sound is crisp and clear. Easy to carry lightweight.Battery life is good but not groundbreaking like oneplus .One problem is that cant switch off via the middle button while conected to phone . So need to first manually switch off bluetooth in phone settings
Overwhelmed by the boat support,4.0,"I simply love this earphones. Besides, I'm overwhelmed by the support that boat provides. It's been 10 months since I bought this earphones. I have had to claim warranty twice so far and boat replaced the earphones both the times. Yeah, I know that it's bad some defect popped up 2 times but come on, almost all the products are error prone. Boat mitigates this problem by providing extraordinary support. Also, reaching out to boat support was a cakewalk."
"In Ilkal 587125 please make Amazon office to eart to delivery,,,,",4.0,"Boat rockers 255 pro is the best Bluetooth headphone,,, sound quality is excellent, build quality is amzing.. totally this headphone is superrrb,, one this is about amazon delivery system is not that much impressive,, very bad experience with amazong delivery system because in ilkal 587125 their no Amazon Office... The delivery boy came from another place to delivery this product,,, soo ilkal is a taluk please make a amazon office"
Great!,4.0,Great sound quality for the price. I was able to use mine for about 18 months for over 6 hours a day before it stopped working. But still a great recommendation. Great bass but not that great in noise cancellation or leak.
Ear phone review,3.0,"Didn't liked it much, in 3 months I had to get it exchanged due to disconnecting issue. More importantly it's noise cancellation feature is not good, when you are talking to someone it catches your background noises more instead of yours . Not a good one for communication purpose."
Only bass is good,2.0,This product has a good bass but noise cancellation is really horrible. U can literally hear the slightest of the surrounding better than the person u r speaking to. Also in a years time it stops working properly. Mine stopped working in 10months time though i always kept it in very careful and ideal way.
Connects 2 devices simultaneously. Not a great feature,4.0,Sound quality is great. Noise cancellation also works. Bass quality is not that great. The earphone connects with 2 devices at a time. Which is a blessing and a curse. If you disconnect one device another device also gets disconnected automatically. Which is quite irritating.
"BATTERY LIFE ,  PRICE and SOUND",4.0,Good product for 1000 Rs.Sound is balanced.Bass is good not great but better than other earphones.Battery life impressive.Go Ahead.  Buy this product for this design ! bikrsing : Assurance Guaranteed !
Disappointing,2.0,"Sound quality and bass are below average. Sound clarity is affected as there is a constant mild disturbance when the earphones are plugged in. The microphone is absolutely useless as the other person can barely hear my voice.I was actually a fan of the boAt wired headphones, I am extremely disappointed to receive such low quality at such a high price."
Noice cancellation/ music quality,3.0,Noice cancellation is too bad. Excet the caller voice you can here ever single voice.The bass is too high. You can not play music for long time/high volume if you are music lover then choose another one.Well rest of things is fine if you use this product for just talk and if you use it into the car or noice free place.
Pathetic Customer service from BOAT,1.0,"I bought the product by looking at the reviews and it has started giving me trouble after 3 months of usage. I tried contacting customer care for several times but it will never connect. After couple of months... somehow i found a way to return the product and get it replaced. it's been months that i have returned the product but no response from the team. Bonus is, customer care number always busy or never connect. Be sure before you buy"
Best quality headphones and neckbands to buy in a fixed budget,4.0,Battery backup is good... sound quality is also nice..bass quality is also too good...best quality headphones and neckbands to buy in a fixed budget... really found it convenient and happy that I didn't wasted money on buying other stuffs..... awesome neckband.... thank you@boat.nirvana for making this product and thank you@amazon for delivery it to us in a fixed time....Thanks a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è
I recommend boat.... Very good customer service...,3.0,Very good for daily talking..I recommend boat...Very good brand... Most of all.. Very good Aftersell customer service... ... My headphone have some issues with power button.... They replaced it with a new one.... Yes it will take time... About 20-30 days..... But they replaced it
Poor quality? I would say so.,2.0,"This was a product suggested by many but with my comprehensive use of over two months I can say it's not a good product. The battery life on this thing is highly inconsistent even when I'm listening to music at same volume( It has happened quite a few times that I charge it to a 100 at night but it doesn't last more than an hour ). The second issue I want to point out is the Bluetooth connectivity. This device connected in a blink for a month or so, but then it used to suddenly disconnect from my device. After a month I started facing issues connecting to the device, sometimes ( even with full battery ) the device was not discoverable. As a whole I would not recommend this pair of wireless earphones."
Warranty service pathetic,1.0,"Never buy anything from boat, their after sale service is pathetic. My earphones button stopped functioning one month after purchase. I've reverse shipped it under warranty claim of my product. Its been over a month since I've shipped it. No response and their customer care number also doesn't work, no representative is available at any time. Better spend some bucks and buy good quality earphones  whose  after sale service is also good."
Value for Money,4.0,"Build quality average. Plastic build and rubber finished product, not feels cheap.Considering the price point, sound quality is awesome. Loud, crispy and vibrant. I purchased it in just Rs 999.Battery backup is also good. 5-6 hrs average usage. BT range 25-30 ft.Overall value for money product."
Not upto the price value.,2.0,"Good but not best as per it's price value.Starting phase is good and you will like it. But after sometime say 5 to 6 months it shows signs of defect like one earphone stops working, delays in connecting, late syncing. I have used 2 products of this within 1 year and both showed same defect i.e defect in one earphone after 4 to 5 months. Boats used improve it's quality.Good earphones but not best rather go for other company I would say."
Read before you buy.... ü§†ü§†,5.0,"Sound quality-9/10üòªComfortable-4/10üëéüëéüòíBuild quality-8/10üòëü§®üòåBattery-10/10üòÑüòÉüòÄüòäüòçBass-9/10üßêü§†üòëüòëIt is good under 1000‚ÇπIf you ask boat rockerz 255 üÜö 255 pro , so my ans. Is 255 pro is the good one...."
Highly NOT RECOMMEND!!!,2.0,"People having Sony or other good earphones experience, don't go for it. You will not like it at all.I am personally a Sony user, but after a long time I wanted to other brand. This is where I went wrong.Honestly, people who don't have Sony experience can like(mentioning 'CAN') this earphone. But for those who love Sony sound, don't go for it."
Best Battery life,5.0,Best under 1500/-Great sound and Battery Life.Sound quality 4Battery life 5Noise cancellation 4.5Built quality 5I am writing this after 1 month of use...
Not suitable for office calls.,3.0,"I bought it to attend office calls from home, in the current COVID-19 situation.Turn out that it is only good for music. Noise cancellation is not good for the voice calls when connected through laptop bluetooth.For regular calls also it is not as efficient, probably this is what you get in 1500."
The ultimate sound and battery,5.0,Best neckband I have ever bought. Build quality is in better side . Sound quality is the best part everything is well balanced.  Bass quality is unbelievable really appreciable. Battery backup is insane. I used it 8 days then it came to 20% out of 100%. You can go for it your eyes closed
Awesome boat,5.0,Purchased almost 2 months used it roughly.....as mentioned it is sweat proof.....sometimes the conection breaks when mobile is in pocket but it is nor regular... Good bass and sound quality.....connects to 2 devices no connectivity issues.....battery lasting for almost 10 hours.....happy with the device
Worst Replacement warranty services. Quality is also not so good.,2.0,Good Product... But very disappointed with quality because just in 15 days one side of  it stopped working... & I have tried to complaint but their complaint handling way is too bad... I've returned it 10 days back but I didn't receive any replacement yet.So I am so disappointed...
Driver error or what!!,2.0,Got this product yesterday.I was using 255f since 1 year so no doubt of sound quality I gone for this pro one.But each time when I lock my phone or exit from any app it automatically maximise the volume  & Nirvana says ‚ÄúMAXIMUM VOLUME‚Äù which feels like bursting my ear drum!! Requested for replacement.May be it‚Äôs a manufacturing defect on it‚Äôs driver part & so the new one gonna replace will be like the same or what!!!
Nice built quality,4.0,"Product is good,but when magnets connected the device is not disconnecting..."
EVERYTHING IS FINE BUT THE PRODUCT DIED FOR NO REASON,1.0,Its sound very inappropriate to say that but i was very happy with the product evrything the sound the noise cancellation the bluetooth connectivity evrything was fine . any one can go for the same for the reasonable price.but but butdont know the reason why its suddenly got dead . 1st time i got replaced the product but waited for somany days 15 - 20 days and get a new one and see again the same issue happened to me . dont know why after proper handling of the product again its dead. so if you are going to buy be prepared
Worth buying according to price and quality,4.0,"Good noise, good bass, sound quality,  you can go for other product also, higher prices of Bluetooth earphones have a good sound quality and battery backup. I like this one , and according to price its worth."
Best Awesome,4.0,Best product you will get in this price range .Battery backup is very good. You could not get better Noise Cancellation in this price. Sound is awesome. Only bad thing about this ear phone is it does not fit in your ear properly .
Go for other brands,1.0,Not satisfied. Feels like something is blocked in my ears when I use. I hear my voice differently when I put. Other side people r also complaining the same. Not comfortable. Because of this headache is also coming. Which I did get through samsung or Sony. There was no return option as well.
High sound during start up in Chinese language.,2.0,The sound quality is very poor. During starting voice from the set is very high that is unbearable. Built quality is also not upto the mark. Hence I am returning this product after 6 days of review.
worst service center services,3.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†within a month i face problem regarding this products, charging draining quickly, red light which shows low battery are continuously blinking even after charged, and when i went for service centre near by my place for exchanging the product they always come up with reply like 'your product in currently unavailable come after a week' worst service when it comes to exchange product üôÑ"
A purchase that is worth it,4.0,"Sound quality is good and the noise is cancelled when playing audio. The bass is stronger than my regular wired earphones. It has magnetic ear pieces so that when it‚Äôs down around your neck it stays there. Battery lasts for 9 hours and recharged in 2 hours. Only pause/play, volume up/down buttons are there. Can not shuffle between songs. I don‚Äôt why, but it keeps beeping when viewing an image. Other than that, it‚Äôs a purchase worth it."
Easy replacement,1.0,"The sound quality with extra bass was good but one earpiece was causing buzz noise even while on stand by, also it was getting disconnected on its own, ordered replacement on 13th Oct, got replaced item on 14th Oct. Thanx Amazon"
There's no Post sale service.,1.0,Don't buy this product.After 8  months one side is not working. But the point is warranty claim service is very poor. I have Lodged complain on 1st august for defect in my boat rockerz 255 wireless Bluetooth earphone. As it was written in the mail to get any response from your side within 48hours.But till now I haven't received any mail regarding warranty claim. This is very sad to know that the well reputed brand is not paying attention to post sale facilities.
Best of the range headphones with a few averages,4.0,"PositivesAmazing headphone with best of the range noise cancellation, bass quality and in ear comfort.NegativesQuality of the rubber hold is low.. it starts to itch and becomes gluey after use in sweat, the function buttons could have be distinct, mic quality is just okay, battery life is average (around 6 to 6.30 hrs if used with music continuously)"
"Best service of boat products , poor battery life , purchase it in sale",4.0,Only minus point with this product is it's battery life... Hardly 3 to 3.5 hr.. takes long time to fully charge.. I used to charge it twice or thrice in a day.Best thing is boat service quality.They will pickup ur product and replace it within 15 days if u having issue with product .Rest ... purchase it in sale...u will get it in 999 otherwise u have to pay 1499 for same.
Amazing Headphone üòç,4.0,"I am using this headphone from last 2 years and still its working good.  sound quality is also good, so i am totally satisfied with this product."
Happy Purchasing!,4.0,"Received the package on 7th May.It's been 4 days since use.Pros:‚Ä¢Instant Connectivity (switch it on & it's connected),‚Ä¢appreciable Noise-cancellation (can cut all bad vibes around you),‚Ä¢all about Bass <plug into Nirvana>‚Ä¢6-7 hrs assured Play Time (it's ok if you forget about charging),‚Ä¢Easy to use (In-line controls on your commands), Comfortable to ears (go on for hours),‚Ä¢Hardy design & Lighweight.Cons:‚Ä¢Range might be a little bit problem.(=<7ft)‚Ä¢Packaging could be a lot better....Anyways! It's all good at 999/- only.(I mean right now, the price is 1,499/-)Hope my earphone works the same in future too!"
Don't use when jogging,3.0,"Can't use when jogging. The base keeps flopping and sliding down your neck and tugging at the earphone which disturbs the sound experience.  I know that these are not ""sport"" earphones, but even regular earphones are less of an issue in this, and having Bluetooth earphones that don't suit exercises defeats the purpose of using Bluetooth."
Great Bluetooth headsets.,5.0,"However i haven't used them properly. But one of my friend is using them. Perfect noise cancellation, great bass. Can be used for outdoors, while riding on bike. Mic is very sensitive. I think earbuds are having mic on each of them. Magnetic lock. Couldn't wait for the sale to buy it for 999. I bought it for 1499."
Worth the bucks,5.0,"Packaging was good (thanks to Amazon), sound quality is good. But the amazing part is it's bass which is (to be honest) beyond expectation. I have also taken feedback from my friends while being on call about it's audio quality and noice cancellation, and it's all good, you won't receive any complaint with that. Battery backup will not disappoint you either, it can last upto 2-3 days with a fair usage of 4-5 hours a day. if you are looking for a value for money deal this is the best option to go with."
Best quality at lowest pricing,5.0,"This was the product I bought for around 900 and the quality it provides is great, especially for the lowest pricing. The sound quality is pretty good, not excellent but connectivity and life is good. Notice cancellation is very good because of the design and overall it's great."
A very good product,5.0,"It's an excellent purchase offering full VFM. The cheaper headphones i used previously used to give me headache after a couple of hours, so was reluctant to try these at first. But have been using Boat Rockerz for a couple of months now and they are really good.The only problem i faced is the battery % it shows on the cellphone. Like when i start the bluetooth device it would say that it has 80% battery remaining (which couldn't have been the case as the headphones were charged over a week ago and were used for at least 5-6 hours) ... and then after 20 mins the battery is zero."
Need to improve the quality of Product for rough and tough use.,3.0,"I am using the ear phone while I am driving, so i am facing various issues in handling and listening. Below are the issue i am facing while using it :1. Background noise cancellation is not upto the mark2. Earbuds are heavy, it hurts after continues usages of 50+ minutes3. Battery backup is 4.5 hours instead of 6 hours as mentioned in their catalog4. battery charging time is too high, around 100-110 min."
Short life product,1.0,It worked good for 5 Months and now left ear speaker is not working. We hoped at least one year satisfactory performance. Not sure warrnty exists and can company take note to improve in keeping brand repute.Thanks.
Not worthy,1.0,Worst thing with Boat is they don't work for more than six months..Either one or both side will definitely stop working..And you will get replacement of those which is either repaired or refurbished..which will again Stop working after six months no matter how carefully you use them.
Warranty,2.0,"I have 1 year warranty,  how to use it"
Amazing Sound Quality but Poor Durability,2.0,This rating is wholly based on the duration they serve. I mean I don't know what is the problem with boat headphone. I bought two-three headphone of it in one single year. But after a few months their one side stops working. Again and again we had to apply for the replacement which takes a long time if you are applying online and support store as well.
Mind blowing and work 100 %batter then other,5.0,"Unreliable earphones with high costThis earphones are unreliable, i bought it before 15 days meanwhile right side ear buds got cracked automatically and it got divided in two parts, and sound quality is also not that much good but ok, one more thing bass is not good as it is a boat earphones.Guys,Also for the proof i have attached picsPlease see and think before buying‚Äã this unreliable product."
You can call him average or below average,3.0,After 3 months of usage I wrote my review on roakerz 255 pro+ sound quality is average and 1st month was going good with this product but after a month multiple issue was raise in this product  issue like sound quality was not stable. No sound is heard in medium capacity of volume. Sound is heard when you raise the sound to its maximum capacityHandset band feels like oily.
Quality issue,2.0,"Did not like the product. Initially there was some issue so i got a replacement. Now its almost 6-7 months and one side earphone is not working. As it comes with 1 years warranty, will try to get it fixed as soon as the lockdown is over."
Very bad,1.0,I have used several boAt products but this model is a huge disappointment. Once I returned and even the replacement is having the same issue. The issue is that irritating noise while switching from one track to another. üò° 1000 rupees waste. Not recommended people! Audio quality is 2 in the scale of 1 to 10.
Not at all long lasting !!!,1.0,"The sound quality is descent. Battery backup and charging is also ok. The charging port cover is very fragile and it came off within few weeks of usage( attached image). After about 12 months of usage, mike has stopped working. Still using for music and workout but cannot use for calling. Wish it was more durable"
Poor Product even Poor Customer Care,1.0,"Don't buy this product as it is a total waste of money. Also it's cheaply made such that it will stop working in a year and don't even considering asking them about warranty coz they never listen. I HAVE MAILED BOAT ROCKERZ as well in hopes of claiming the warranty but they won't reply. And on the top of that there is absolutely no way to reach them, not on Amazon as well."
Ahh! damn this extreme bass with this nominal price had fired the music soul within me.,5.0,"Overall the product is perfectly fine from bass, terrible, noise cancellation, battery everything is up to mark. Boat is providing the best ever music quality and it's for sure a product that can be purchased with close eyes.Cons**Amazon packing is worst, I have got the product with open sealed,  I was thinking about the return but though product was running alright I changed my mind to keep it so.**No casing, sometimes it became hard to keep them apart from wearing."
2 weeks of usage and the left side stops working. Didn't expect it from a Boat.,1.0,"The overall function of the headphones stopped after 2 weeksI called the service center, they asked us to drop it off at there and then they would decide if it needs to be replaced.My suggestion to all the buyers, think twice as they aren't of much quality."
Amazing Product,5.0,"The Boat Pro Bluetooth headset is a total value for money.Because Boat Rockerz 255 Pro offers better battery life, decent sound output, fast charging, advanced QCC3003 chipset, new color variants and the latest Bluetooth connectivity.Boat Rockers 255 Pro gives us very good features with a little more money than Boat Rockers 255 wireless headphones."
Money wasted as only 1 earpiece working within a week of buying.,2.0,"One of the ear sound out put has stopped within a week of buying the product without any physical damage been done.And since it was a gift to my friend by the time i got to know return window had closed.Money Wasted, hope i get a replacement for this after review is read by the concerned people."
Good for gym purpose,4.0,Using this from 2-3 months. All is good apart from battery discharge. It 100% for 5 hours and then in one hour it will 0%. I don't think its a big deal and this issue is there when I bought it.As per its design it can be use in gym with different exercises for that I have to set it above my ears sometime and sometime opposite of it.I won't recommend for long hours uses. It will cause pain in ears.
Good speakers for daily callling or if you move a lot,5.0,"I use to call from my phone when I go on a walk. On my laptop, I prefer using a wired headphones because - no need to charge, great sound and can still hear if someone is calling, ear hurts less if i use it for longer duration."
* MUST BUY  *,5.0,"Very well balanced. Sound is really amazing , build quality is just wow , would last for long. Bass is punchi n sound is well balanced.Last but not the least, if u looking headset for pubg then blindly go for it, there is actually no sound delay while paying pubg I triedany Bluetooth headphone even costlier but no one manage that which boat 255 did.Compare to latest Realme bud wireless this one is far better as I have used realme buds wireless.Trust me, just go for it"
Battery backup is the majour concern.,3.0,"No doubt about sound quality. Majour concern is battery backup, it won't come 3-4 hrs. Magic stuff is battery level will be showing as 20% and we will get voice alert too but it will get turned off immediately. It's not auggestable for those who are looking for long battery life."
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR LONG USAGE AND WORKOUTS,4.0,"First and foremost the sound quality is great . Secondly,  this earphone is great for working out and long usage (like 6 to 8 hours) . You will experience no pain in your ears until or unless you put the earbuds too deep in your ears .I highly recommend this for an average earphone user because they are just great for a price of 900."
Worst headset,2.0,"I order this headset previous year and after 1-2 months I didn't able to talk via call because after few minutes on call the bluetooth was disconnected or some worst sound came on call like buzz buzz and also our voice breaks on call. Bad experience, Firstly in first month headset was ok and good sound quality but after few month it shows its quality and disappointed me."
Not happy with the product as well as return policy.,1.0,Gives lot of disturbance while driving.Also the bluetooth range is not good.Gets paused while listening to music..I want to return this product now but the window is closed. Also the retailer is not supportive.I ordered 2 by mistake and wanted to return one.I raised a request on the day I got the delivery. But did not get support from Amazon as well as the retailer.
Highly recommended,5.0,"Highly recommended. These guys are so best and so professionals. I had my earphones not working so just lodged a service request, they arranged shipment to and fro and just replaced with a new earphones set. I was amazed already but this is epicüî• Go Team Boat üí™"
50-50,2.0,"All is good and worth the money. But accessories are not available which is a huge drawback and pushes me to the edge for not recommending it. Ear hooks are not available online and are easily lost. Why not but something with a pattern available over the counter. That's why 2 star, other wise a good buy"
My first bluetooth earphone..... found boat 255+pro very much best,4.0,"Received on 09.10.2021 & used continuously till date (21.10.2021), its battery is still 60 %I m satisfied by boat rockers 255 pro +No problem found yet.Brought under rs 900 offer.Thanks boat company"
Simply Perfect,5.0,"Got a great deal on prime day.. bought this wonderful productIt's simply perfect, sound quality is too good, connects to the phone very easilyCharging lasts throughout the day, with good amount of calls & music tooI would recommend a buy"
Overpriced. Bass should be tuned to prevent it from actual sound.,3.0,<first  hour review>Phone call:Poor voice quality on phone calls. Some bass kills the clarity in voice.Music:Inferior sound quality when listening to music.Podcast:Average performance. Unnecessary bass is spooling the podcast experience.
Poor battery and noise cancellation,2.0,"First impression is good. Sound quality is good. But the grip to hold earphones around your neck is quite light. Sometimes it gets fly away when you are driving. Battery life is good but after using it for 9 days i felt that when the battery is 60% and suddenly it gets down to 20 so fast and recently i was at 60% and suddenly the earphones gets off. After i got replacement, the new product seems to work very nice regarding the battery life but the noise cancellation was damn bad like you can't listen to the music while driving because the noise of the wind is too loud you cant even talk.. and hence i had to return the product.."
Bass addicted fellows just go and buy,4.0,"Amazing product ,As per in pricing concern ,,Who is addicted to find bass quality sound in music , just go and buy this , this is the perfect for you.Whenever you listen music every bit of every tone you can listen and feel that sound .Battery performance:Battery performance is also good , as per my usage while playing music , calling it's better .Just go and buy this product."
Value for money,3.0,"It is good value for money.  Connects very well and no issues.  But sound quality is not that great to listen music.  It does not comes close to samsung earphones.  But sound quality for speaking is good.If music is your priority, go for other earphone, else buy this."
Amazing Product!,5.0,Boat products always come onto the expectations! Boat rockerz 255 pass my expectations!...The product finish is very good and the look is of premium earphones...the sound quality is good if u are a bass lover!....also the noise cancellation is pretty good if we compare with other earphones....The fit of these earphones is very good and comfortable and do not hurt your ears even after prolonged use. I have also been out in light rains wearing these and i am quite impressed with its moisture wicking!....also the earphones are very light weight and don't even feel on your neck which is a must condition for Bluetooth earphones!....overall it is the best buy for 999/-.
"Good, perfect design ergonomically.",5.0,Quaint connection notification by disembodied Californian hippie. Love the way the wire leads thicken and have enough heft to sit on the neck loosely without danger of falling off.
Please replace my product.,1.0,"Very bad Bluetooth please don't by this type of product..boat is very bad company. After 3 month battery got bloated , getting charging issue and battery will drain after 2 hr . please don't by. service centers not accepting this product they clearly refused to take this product and I already mailed to company for replace but I haven't get any reply from company."
Average quality,3.0,"- connecting the device is very tedious, sometimes it won't connect until you power off and power on again.- static noise plays whenever any sound is played.- poor noise cancellation mic, the other person can't hear you properly."
Value for money at 899 ;),4.0,"Yet to use long term, but build quality and sound quality is good. Face some loss in connectivity when the band is covered. Good to watch movies and music on the go. Not sure how it well it functions when going for a run or exercising."
its wireless connectivity,2.0,"wireless connectivity is very poor.when you put your mobile in the room and you enter in other room, your blutooth connectivity is lost.and one more thing while you walking or running, sound will be fluctuate.so, finally i want to say that if you want to buy proper neckband then you should have to purchase above rs 1500."
Sleek and worth the money,5.0,"Handy and sleek design is what makes this bluetooth earphone amazing. With good sound quality, and noise cancellation, easy connectivity it has everything that is needed to make it worth the money. Go for it if you need a good blutooth earphone.."
Value of money,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Worth of money I used it for 1 week and I bet that you will not listen any thing in this earphone in fulll volume it has large battery backup I testd it by using it for my 6hours continuous usage then  also it had 50% battery remaining and it is a trusted brand also just go for it"
boAt Rockerz 255 Pro,5.0,Sound quality is goodBass is niceBattery backup more than 5 hours in medium volumeEar holding fin is hurting my ear size differ from two sidesCharging cable too much tight..plug and unplugging is very complex.Fast charging good..1 hour charging more than 2 hours playback
Not worth it,3.0,"No matter how many time you'll use this product , at the end of the year this will automatically stop working and you'll have to replace it and than after the replacement again the same problem will, either it will not charge properly or else left side of the earphones will stop working.  These two are the major issues which Boat should solve .. I've seen the same issues in many boat users"
Not setting in ears,3.0,"Sound quality is good, but it is not setting in ears, always falling down, I have tried to cancel the product but Amazon has replaced me with another one. What's the use in replacement, when it is not setting in ears. U should have given an option to choose headset of another company. I'm dissatisfied with this. If you have any possibility at least please allow me to cancel this and buy earphones of another company"
Sound quality: Great! Build quality: Not so great.,3.0,"Sound quality is great. The bass is especially very enjoyable. The vocals were not that good but if you like EDM, this neckband is excellent.The build quality is what made me return these. The material felt like it was very cheap. The ear buds were made of metal and the eartips were also good silicone but I'm talking about the rest of the neckband. The rest of the neckband was made of cheap silicone."
The brand name is enough,5.0,Its bewn a while using boat products and i am highly satisfied and recommend this.Quality is crisp and bass is heavy.Overall it depends on your song preferences and the performance varies accordingly.
Piece of Junk.,2.0,Piece of crap. Intially it was good . After 2 months one side became completely useless and the interesting part is it happened overnight. Complete piece of junk dont buy it if you care for your money . I got it for 899 and here I'm regretting if you're buying it for more than that you will regret more that i did.
Good gadget but not best,4.0,"So after using it for more then 20 days I am writing this review ,first of all this gadget is cool in looking and working also ,but it will not work as per the specified effective range to operate, i have paired it with  asus zenfone laser 3 and few other devices ,facing the same problem.Talking about the battery backup ,it is awesome ,charging time is very fast and long lasting .The best part of this is that ,it is very comfortable to wear without any hassle or if you are a music lover that prefer to hear music most of the time than you can go with it, but you can check other option as well in the same price range ."
Nice but check out others too,4.0,"After using it almost for a month, at times, hearing low battery notification kills me. Initially, I thought 6hrs of play time is enough for me. I will not mind recharging it every evening/night but in reality that does not happen..at least for me. Also, I don't push the earpieces very firmly for 100% noise cancellation. And then, I feel to increase volume and then the expression...uhh..already max :(Overall, I liked it with above experiences time to time :|"
Not as expected. Using indoor is ok,3.0,The charging percentage is not showing clearly. Always it shows 80 % and suddenly drops to battery low. Microphone is very far away from the mouth and is in opposite direction. So that the  surrounding noise is clearly heard than our voice to the other end person. Long time using tends to bring you ear pain as it is not ergonomically designed it gives us pain because of the ear buds. The wire width is larger than it appears on the photo and is not comfortable while run or working out. And the main disadvantage is it completely didn't allow outside noise while using hence it is not recommended during driving
Good for phone calls,3.0,Good product for phone calls. Good battery life. But sound quality is not good. Sounds of singers appears different when heared through it. Wired headphones with same price range offers far better sound clarity.
Best earphone if bought under 1500,3.0,I used this product for like 6 months. In between one side of its earphone stopped working but boat team is too responsive as they replaced this product with new one. Sound quality is good but if you want better quality would recommend for other product. Battery life is best even using for so much of time. But facing difficulties as there always some kind of issue happening again and again. Other then its fine if it is bought under sale.
So attractive Bluetooth headset with flexible deign and Immersive sound,5.0,"Crispy and Immersive sound with top class built quality.. you will be fan of this bluetooth headset... Very nice design and flexible too for daily usage. After one charge it can last upto 3 days with 80% sound level and proper stand-by use.I can surely tell you to go for it, value for money product from boat."
"Best in Segment, Battery backup is about 36 hours in single charge.",5.0,"Best in segment product, Battery backup is really good, it's lasts up to 36 hours in single charge, Sound & call quality is decent, Bass is also above average. Worth buying, Recommend."
noise cancellation zero,1.0,"how can they claim it is with cvc ? during call, noise is full and no words can be listened. better go with boat 385v2 or one plus for better call noise cancellation"
"Hyped product , really well marketed",3.0,"bluetooth connectivity distance is merely 3-4 metres, finishing of the product is decent and satisfactory.  Not too comfortable in the ear. Plugging in the charging cable is not so smooth, you have to press really hard but you need to be careful too as you might ruin the socket. Noise cancellation level is really low and is a irritating for the person on the receivers end. Good product if you want to use it in places with less external noise and just want to listen to music and don want to spend a lot on a bluetooth earphone set."
Worth to buy,4.0,Fantastic product. Sound quality is too good. Most important battery back up i got delivery 4 days ago since then i dont need to charge and use daily 4-6 hours.
Wrost product,1.0,"Hi friends, I'm writing this review after 4 months of using this product, intially it has good sound and bass was awesome but this head phones life was not good with in 4 months my right side of the speaker stopped working and left side of the speaker works with less sound and the quality of the product is very cheap. I would like to suggest you not to purchase this product."
Continuously Hearing weird sound,2.0,"So I bought 2 sets of these headphones on the prime day sale(for 1299/- each).The headphones got connected very easily and I played some songs,the sound quality and base are totally fine but here's the main problem you continously hear a weird noise in the background both when you're playing and when you're not.So I'm telling you please dont go for the price go for the quality and brand (be It a little bit costlier but you'll get something better)"
awesome product,4.0,"i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time, gifted first one to brother. This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening music on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it contiguously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear."
Overall well built. Easy connectivity. Light weight only led indicator needs to be visible,5.0,4sep Amazing product very very useful while taking calls as there great connectivity and 10 meter usage is actually true very Happy with the product.Happy with this product but the only challenge is that the led indicator is not visible clearly i think boat needs to work on that portion also it's very light weight easy connectivity having a good experience so far.
Not at all worth buying,1.0,This device is just too poor as it won't even last long. One side Gets damaged too fast and easily whereas within the next fortnight the other side also develops faulty issues which look like this device has been planned or programmed to get damaged one side after another within a very few months after its usage. Complete waste of money and very poorly created tech. Try spending on some other device rather than this piece of garbage.
Good one though could have been better,5.0,Good to opt for if you want a low range bluetooth earphones with long lasting battery life. Sound Quality is good though not as good as other models of Boats earphones. There's little bass. Bluetooth connectivity is impressive. And battery lasts for almost a day of normal usage and 5-6 hours of heavy usage. Only drawback is its very poor noise cancellation. You can't use it to talk on calls. Person on other side will hear all other surrounding sounds except your voice.
Poor After sale  Customer Service,1.0,Mine stopped working within 4 months.1. Good looks.2. Good sound quality as well but poor calling experience.3. Poor quality as it has stopped working withing 4 months.4. Bass is OK.
Bass and its range is very good it is stay connected upto 10 to 11 meters,5.0,I think in this price point . boAt  rockerz 255 is  one of the best bluetooth earphones in India. I bought it in  only 979 rs. Bass is good and voice is also loud  . so overall this is a  good product from boAt . And thankss amazon for giving  me this awesome product  only within three days . I am happy with this delivery undoubtedly . If your budget is under 1000 you will go for it . Thank u
Read this review before buy,4.0,Sound quality good compare to price.Best for zoom office meetings.Connectivity also good but can be improveI found difficulty with buds its little bit annoying when u plugged in the ear.Cannot hold for longOverall good product
"Please please don't buy any Boat company products, please don't waste your money.",1.0,Guys please please don't buy any Boat company products if your product will not working and if you have a warranty then also they will not replace your products.such a disappointing boat warranty service.I lose my money because of those worst boat warranty services.Please don't waste your money and don't trust boat services.
Awesome bass and sound,4.0,"I just received 255Sound nd bass awesomeBluetooth range 10 mtrs.Bill is not complete.Bill half-torn: If there is a problem in it, then there will be no problem in replacing it?If it is kept in a mobile room, then its range is 10-12 feet when you go out.If the mobile is kept out and we are out: its range is 30 ft.Received 4 earbuds.call ke time bat krne pr srrrr srrr ki awaj aa rhi h.Aaj to mujhe Mila hai.ise kuch time use krne ke baad hi kuch or bta skuga.abhi tk to ye mstttt hIt's my third boat product1st boat car charger2nd boat headphoneNd 3rd rockerz 255."
Poor quality of the product,1.0,"Waste of money . Within two months the left side of earpiece isn't working . Inspite of the fact that there is one year warranty , when u raise a complaint there is no reply to ticket generated . Tried calling many times to the costumer care but no reply . Never expected this low quality from boat Bluetooth earphones . Poor quality of product and bad customer service ."
Best Bluetooth Headset,5.0,"The best part of this phone is the charge which dips down slowly.I bought it on 26th Nov'21 with 100% since then today 29th Nov'21 the charge has dipped only by 20%.Also the sound,bass is good soothing for the ears"
Got Used Product..,3.0,"Ordered new not refurbished but i got used one..Noticed opening impressions on both top and bottom side openings of the packing box..white powder like dust on both eartips, can be seen from outside of the box.not even opened the box yet.I'll post my review after listening to it."
Pathetic Headphones and Worst Customer Service,1.0,I had raised a ticket for a pair of headphones that were not working.I was promised a pickup of the product as soon as lockdown opens but looks like they just passed time till my one year of warranty expired in July 2020.I have to try to call them but stupid chatbot doesn't solve the purpose.Any new ticket that I file is just closed without any proper reply.I will post this review on Amazon.in also.
Very Bad quality Never buy again,1.0,"Very bad quality of the material, initially the product seems to be fine, but after using for 3 months the sound quality detoriate, after 4 to 5 months now the right side ear piece is not working. leaft side is OK , however very low sound. Not able to contact the customer care. no one bothers"
Poor quality,1.0,I will never suggest anyone to buy this product it has a very poor quality.. and the saddest thing is company gives extremely poor services..they don't even pick up call they don't even resolve your query.. don't even reply to your emails..service centres are sometimes open and sometimes close so even if the product is in one year warranty it is of no use it's a wastage of money to spend on this product.HIGHLY UNSATISFIED..
Bluetooth stopped connecting with any device within 10 days,2.0,"The product was working fine for 10 days. After that it stopped connecting to any device. Tried charging for a full day, but it was still not connecting.Boat customer service was superb. They came and  took the device immediately within 24 hours of regsietring the compalint. It took them 14 days to fix the complaint and they have send it back. Need to check after recieving."
Duplicate product,1.0,Surely a duplicate product. I already own a raging red coloured 255 rockerz which has a very good sound. But this earphone sounds like a local train headphone. There is no option on amazon to return. I got it replaced again got the similar product. Worst in sound.
Price justified with some minor glitches,3.0,"The headphones are justified for the price that they are available. I am using these since 15 days now and haven't noticed any major drawback, except that the Bluetooth keeps disconnecting if you are using it while on bike. Some modulations are noticed then. Also, after connecting to a laptop if tried  to connect to the cellphone it does not auto connect. Otherwise and sound quality is good for a normal usage. Battery life is also decent around 4-5 hours of constant use."
No service supprt,1.0,"I bought this earphone in Feb. It has stopped working - under warranty period. Amazon directed me to contact Boat, but boat is not registering complaint. I hv informed Amazon, but even they are not helping. Boat does not hv service center even in state capital ( Raipur,Chhattisgarh ).  So, buy Boat product without expecting service support either from Boat or Amazon."
Bass lover,4.0,Length of the earphones are so long its handy after its best . The Backup is 5- 6 day on use of 60 to 80%  I am happy with this product. ¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞ Noice cancellation is just ok type. ¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞If you are bass lover then go for it ¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞sound quality is ok when you set on 100  volume then you go on another world
Sound is good. But after a few months right ear bud is not working. DON'T BUY,1.0,After 6 months of use sound on left side is not available. It has good backup. But most of this product has hearing problem on left side. SO MY SUGGESTION IS NOT TO BUY  THIS PRODUCT.
"no bass, only stereo, earpainful sound quality, 3.5 hr battery,",1.0,"its more of a stereo kind of headset.no bass and battery backup is only 3.5 to 4 hr of continuous usage.also, the battery Direct drops to 0 from 20% and switches off within 1 minute showing a low battery.also the discount is highly shown inflated.boat website themselves sell for 999, and amazon ka great indian festive sale price is 899.i bought a oneplus headset lateron , lot better than this"
Good product can be better,3.0,It's very bad if wear it when you are laying on a bed not comfortable at all!Over the time you will be adjusted !Anyway it's charge very fast and last almost 7hours continue.But after 4 month of use it's stop working power not even on!Maybe my bad luck üòÖ
Just review others who has already bought this product.,3.0,"There are no issues at all of sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality. But yeah it sometimes causes noises to interrupt the earphones due to which when we hear sounds, the bass gets changed. Also, there are some connectivity issues and the connectivity gets automatically cancelled due to malfunction. Positive points include long battery backup, sufficient distance for connectivity, etc.."
Overall Good enough.,4.0,The earphones are good enough for people not looking for something extremely great. Good dound quality and great connectivity. Backup is around 6 hours like mentioned in description. The only thing i found bad which others users have also mentioned is call quality. There is literally zero noise cancellation on call. Other person keeps on complaining that they can hear all the noise around except my voice. Overall.. its a good choice in this budget. Convinient to handle.
Fraud by boat,1.0,In spec boat mentioned that it dose support aptx technology but in reality it does not support it. In my phone all options of aptx are grayed out and it says your headset does not support aptx.
Poor Warranty claiming.,1.0,"Don‚Äôt buy this product. Sound and base quality is very bad. Product become faulty within 2-3 months itself. I registered a ticket with them. Delivery partner collected the product from my home. Thereafter no reply. Tried customer care number, updated in ticket there is no update from boat. I strongly recommend for not to buy this product who lives in Kerala especially. Because there is no service centre available for Boat"
Nice good.,5.0,I got at an attractive price of 799. This is my 2nd purchase. The first purchase was a year ago. And it's still working properly. This one I bought for myself.
Simply Superb,5.0,Excellent connectivityLooks durableBetter sound clarityMic is great tooBattery charging is great tooLove this product
amazing,5.0,"don't think too much, just go with it. 7 people i know have this including me and no complaints. the fit is good and the quality is also good. Charge time is 2-3 hours and you can use up to 6-7 hours. Boat is a trusted brand, just go with it"
"Not worth as per price, even after increasing full volume",2.0,"Not worth as per price, even after increasing full volume of mobile the Bass effect sensed, also no treble sound came, please don't buy this headphones at all its a waste of money. felt very disappointed after ordering a brand like boat such thing has happened. Please don't buy any Boat Earphones , headphones or neckbands, prefer other local brand infact."
So nice and budget friendly,5.0,Actually I used it almost for 3 months where I feel it's better Time to reviewBattery back is awesome as mentionedBass is superSound quality is goodNoise cancellation is goodIt's also can be wearable when jogging or at the time of exercise there is no tension of falling from ears which I feel so betterFor these reasons I'm so satisfied with the product and costI bought it for Rs 1500/-
Background Noise cancellation not good,3.0,"Got the earphones 3 days back. As with other boAt earphones the sound quality including bass is really good, but the background noise cancellation is not good. When i am talking on phone, the quality of sound heard by the person on the other side is not good with lot of background noise from my side, which doesnot happen with wired earphones or talking without earphones. Battery backup till now is good. No other issues."
Received a faulty piece - Appario Retail Private Ltd,1.0,one side (left) earbud is not working - i purchased this product to support local brand but paid the price for my reason. received a faulty piece from this brand/seller. don't have warranty centers nearby. how should i approach and whom i should approach?
diconnects automatically... choppy sound,1.0,"I'll keep it brief. Don't buy this item unless you are ok with choppy interrupted music. Also, the ergonomics suck big time.I hope amazon filters my review and you find this useful in avoiding your purchase. I decided to return the item within minutes of using it (and I'm usually quite patient). So you can now take a call.Good luck... God Bless"
NOT FOR GAMING,3.0,"Too much latesy while playing BGMI or other game. Foot step, gun fire, sound effects comes very late ..better use rs 30 earphones with audio jack it will provide accurate time and good sound..Bass effects are goodcall connectivity avgand it's painful can't use for long time"
Works only for call and media,4.0,"I'm writing this after using for 3 months. I mainly bought it for running and cycling to avoid wired earphones. Sound quality is great and you get what you have expected in aspects of sound. But, it works only for calls and media. There are plenty of other app like maps, etc., with voice navigator. If you are using it when driving with maps, it doesn't work. If you are going to listen just music, its good to go."
Pathetic sound quality,2.0,"I bought it because i heard many positive reviews but tge pieces we got even in replacement, mic was very poor. Sound quality during call was very disturbing. Cant recommend it."
Awesome at 999,5.0,"I bought this in May '21 sale, been using for 2 days. Bluetooth connectivity is good, I moved to another room i.e. away from the mobile, phone call did not get disconnected. I was skeptical after reading reviews about call clarity due to ANC i.e. Active Noise Cancellation, however, I found the call clarity to be good. I would recommend buying this Bluetooth headset"
Good sound quality,5.0,The product is worth the money. It has a nice feel in-ear. It can connect to two devices at the same time. Overall very good. The five star is for their customer service as I received replacement without any hiccups.
Not having proper battery life...,1.0,"Even though sound and other features are nice, the battery life sucks. It shows 80% in phone, and with in minutes it will be down to 20% and will turned off. Not sure if it is defective product or the model.Adding to my earlier review, this ear phone is not getting detected in any new devices after it got connected to first phone. Such a pathetic experience, first with battery and now with Bluetooth."
Average,3.0,"‚Ä¢ Bluetooth 4.1 not that much effective, you can buy v5.0 . It will stop working when any obstacle under 10 meter. Not good when you are working and moving. Sound will stuck.‚Ä¢ bass is average‚Ä¢ It has only 5to6 hr play back. Not for people who use earphones 24√ó7 but boat rockers have more play back time.‚Ä¢ built quality not comfortable as compared to boat rockers 235v2. Poor looking and irritating.‚Ä¢ Boat rockers 235v2 may be good compared to 255."
Bad earphone with sound and battery backup.,1.0,"Below average product. Not happy at all.Pros : good sound qualityvery uncomfortable, silicon buds are not soft. Bought a memory foam bud pair to use it.Battery life is not ok. Battery is not run as it's brand name .Once give a low battery alarm, dies within  2minOne side is given good and another side give less.No return possiblePlease please please please do not buy any mode."
Very very good n cool product......,5.0,"First of all thank you for selling good products.I ordered this product for gift purpose, but received in damage condition (charging section cover was damaged, charging kit not avaliable within box).Same we replace this, next day i received this replacement with good condition,sound quality Amazing......üÜílook wise üíØ% cool.battery back also goodüîã4.5 to 5 hoursValue of money....üôè"
Not worth the price,1.0,Massive compromise on sound quality for bluetooth connectivity. Also not that snappy of a connection as their over the ear counterpart Boat Rockerz.The punchy bass of Sennheiser CX 180 is way better than this.
Not worth for money,2.0,"The earbuds are not at all good , in quality as well as it will not fit in your ear properly.Battery  life is good and sound quality is below average.There are better options available in the market in terms of technology and value for money.I bought it just because Indian company making a product and and the in the add display it was appearing quality product.I bought this product @1999 INR , and after week i saw someone is selling it @1499 INR .But I'm not a kind of buyer to return the product just for money difference."
"Got quick replacement of product by ""Boat""",4.0,"After use of 1 month I faced problem, but after contacting to ""Boat"", got quick replacement of product without any hustle. Thanks to pickup and drop warranty replacement proviflded by ""Boat""."

*Product quality dropped drastically. Very much disappointed*,5.0,"*Product quality dropped drastically. Very much disappointed*Product quality is very poor.The curve near the neck is very straight and not as mentioned in the picture online. The quality of income and outgoing voice calls is pathetic. This isy third order and experience of last two same products was awesome but nowadays they dropped the quality drastically. When we plug in the welcome sound now says ""you now connected to boAt rockerz"" while on my earlier devices it clearly says ""you now connected to boAt rockerz 255"" somewhat it looks duplicate product."
2 days thought about boat rockerz 255 Bluetooth earphones,3.0,"I really did expected something good from this earphones. The sound quality is neutral, Bluetooth range is not so good(maybe 6 meters at home, 9 meters outdoors) and latency is observable(when you notice that is(^o^), battery life is decent as it is new (will write once it's a few months old) and please don't fall for the 2 device connecting at same time. It's so poorly engineered that if u connect to 2 device after 5 mins of work (:-P) it flickers and sometimes disconnects. The build looks promising but the ear hook is specifically made for people with long ears ( it hurts my ears during prolonged use)."
Just read once and u will get allü§üüòé,5.0,"Worth for money...Connectivity is awesome..U gonna love the base.. its really too much..And most importantly battery life , many reviews says it's exhaust fast but I bet u can't increase the volume above 40% it's more than enough to listen a pleasurable song, and at this rate battery will last more than 6 hours for sureüòéü§üü§ü go for it.. and don't forget to register your product for warranty claim."
Good Product,4.0,"I have been using for a few months now. It has a battery life of 4/5 hrs.Good Bluetooth connectivity, sound quality.The instrument is not tough for rough use. But if used carefully looks like it will last.Good buy"
When you supply the product available service centre.,1.0,I bought product from Amazon use 20 day  after 20 day bluetooth auto disconnected from my Mobile more try but not connected then call Amazon customer care and say product replacement time over so we have could not change contact boat rockers care then contact boat rockers care no service center available in sri nagar very bad product waste my money.
Its Value for Money..,4.0,"If you want to hear a real sound with a great beat..You can try it out..Its sound quality is far better than Rockerz 385 V2.However, the noise cancellation is not up to the mark but other than that.everything is just awesome. If anyone want to hear a good quality sound with definitive bass, should try this out at once ."
Ok ok,3.0,"Usually use for calls. Intermittently keeps getting announcement "" Disconnected "" & then again connected. Battery lasts for 3 days. Volume is loud while hearing & other person hears a lot back ground noise n unwanted noise n many times asks to repeat what I said earlier. With the given price it's ok ok."
"the build is not up to the mark, and misguiding claims",3.0,"features like qualcomm cvc and aptx were claimed on the boat website but it has nothing such, and it doesnt even properly perform dual pairing, you could hear only one sound.also ears pain after some duration of time"
Connectivity issue while using WIFI and Bluetooth simultaneously.,4.0,"Overall product is good.But DON'T BUY if you're using wifi as primary source for internet connectivity,as it hinders Bluetooth connectivity while taking WhatsApp calls.i checked the issue on 3 different phones(OnePlus 6t, iPhone 7,op 3t).i have returned product twice but the problem  didn't resolve.But on the other side,when your cell phone is connected to your sim card internet connectivity,it works well."
Good quality and light weight,4.0,I am loving this experience. Good sound quality and battery life is good too(My charge lasts for 4/5 hours) . I am yet to experience other issues if there are any.
cheap and best,5.0,got this wireless once when the wire once were destroyed ...... the product design is amazing the quality is good better than expected fits perfectly and the battery back up comes up to around 12 hours with full use ....so i would recommend this as you can charge and use it at the same time rather than putting it in the box and waiting till it gets recharged
Dont buy this cheap trash,1.0,I bought this on 24/04/2019..Ones side of it stopped working since 28th June... I requested for replacement..They picked up my product on 4th July..Till now (06/08/2019) I didnt get repalced product...They have customer care no. vch they never lift.. In 100 attempts they answered my call only once... and asked about ticket no. I provided my complaint token no....Then they siad due to technical problem status is not showing...then they cut my call without any further information... I lost Rs. 1700..I urge everyone dont buy this kind of trash from such kind of cheaters...
Good for temporary usage,3.0,After usage of 1.5Yr now one of my headset stopped working. Initially sound quality was damn good but after the regular usage can identify the distortion in meetings and also there is slight delay in audio. If you are looking for temporary usage go for it.
Awesome,5.0,Excellent product. I got it in lightning deal for 899. Worth at that price. Even it is worth to buy at 999. Sound quality is awesome. Bass is too good. Bluetooth connectivity is fast and no issue. I connected it to 2 devices simultaneously.
Price not justified,3.0,"Overall the quality is okay but it can be improved. I bought this for calls mainly and have observed these issues.The band is very light & flexible which keeps slipping. The noise cancellation is bad which means when you're connection to your Bluetooth, the person on the other side of the call will hear surrounding voices which is irritating."
Don't buy.. go for one plus bullet Z,1.0,Guy's don't buy.. best You go for one plus bullet Z it's osm...Boat rockers 255pro+ build quality is not good it can't foldable it made with plasticOver compare boat rockers 255pro+ v/s one plus bullet ZThe one plus bullet Z is osm‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
Not a good buy,1.0,"Not a good product at all. Mic don‚Äôt work well picks up entire surround noise . Battery life is sick hardly gives 3-4 hrs of play time.I opted for a exchange of the product, it didn‚Äôt get delivered at all. After following up on exchange for a week. Amazon customer service says that it is damaged in transit after the repeated followup, the replacement was still in cargo yard and none delivered it and updated as they wanted."
Higher Price with low bass,1.0,I purchased it in sell still the price was higer my friend purchased same one 599 and I purchased it 899 . This is not fair and bass quality is alo not good. I am using ptron bassbudds which is quite good as compared to this one
Sound quality is very good and its connectivity is good but the spares as a problem,3.0,Issue with this product is we do not get an extra ear support. As these are only given 2 of them and are very tent to loos them as there are not so thigh fix to the head phones. Even the same is not available to buy as an option to buy as a spares
Bad experience,1.0,"It will not disconnect when both ear phons are magnetic connect,  main important point is when i was  called or who called  receiver not hear proper during communication voice volume very low we need take mice close mouth.....but i used another bluetooth device there is not problem, so i would request you pls give me good product with my expectation otherwise pls rambus my money, as per cost product is not good"
Very bad experience,1.0,"Right side ear bud stopped working , and when claiming warranty then it was unable to process ,also customer care no is not valid . Very bad experience with this product , as mentioned above it's comes with 1 year replacement warranty, but don't get tempted that's all lie"
"Try something else, don't go for this one",1.0,"I heard that these headphones are good and so I went to buy these, but I won't recommend these to anyone, after I used these for a month.The sound quality is not up to mark and the main thing is the pitch changes automatically even when phone is locked.Noise cancellation is good but by other aspects, these headphones are not worth money."
"Not happy, going to return it.",1.0,"Earphone is not adjusting in ear. In every 5 minutes, it fell down.It happens due to extra weight.So I didn't like this. I wasted my money."
Decent for the price,3.0,"Unlike my other blutooth headphones, this one has to be switched off manually. My other one switched off when the magnets connected.Also, I'm having trouble answering calls via headphone.But it's perfect for rough use and i keep this pair to use when I workout."
.,2.0,"Everything thing is the best ..Sound quality ,bass, micro phone etc etc ..But the main problem is that after using 6/7 months left side of bud stopped working and the exact same thing happened with my sisters earphones , thats why I have decided to write review ..When we pay 1500 we expect at least we can use the same for a year and the problem is warranty they provide is only for only 6 months ..So take decision accordingly ü§£Otherwise these were one of the best earphones I have ..Something I still use my old earphones and the right bud is giving his 100%ü§£ü§£"
Must have..!!,5.0,Lives up to the expectation. Good finishing.. Sporty look. Great sound & bass. Choose the music mode from your phone if it's available. Volume & play/pause button work great. Long press volume up/down buttons to change songs. Middle button picks/hangs up calls... Great deal..!!
Outstanding,5.0,"Generally Bluetooth headphones sound quality will not good. But ""boat"" smash everything. It's exceptionally good. Build quality is awesome. No words about sound quality. User friendly. Comfortable in ear. I'm very satisfied about this product. üëå"
Abruptly stopped working,1.0,"This is the 3rd time I have purchased this. The earlier 2 are working fine, that were purchased many months back. However, the 3rd one has stopped charging within 3 weeks of the purchase and now I am unable to find any option for return/refund/replacement."
Another awesome creation by Boat!,5.0,"Its a brilliant earphone! The audio is crisp, clear with thumping bass. Fits well in the neck and gets connected in a sec too. The Neon color adds some style to it. It came in a nice box with accessories and manuals. Boat never disappoints!"
Stopped working in 6 months. Poor noise cancellation and durability,1.0,Writing this review after using it for 11 months. Noise cancelling is very poor. One can hear whats os happening around more clearly.  Durabilty is strong disadvantage. It is stopped working in less 6 months. Only 1 ear phone is working after 6 months. Overall waste of money for 6 month usage
Worst,1.0,Don't buy these.... battery is poor... always there's hissing sound even when nothing is being played.... There's continue disturbance in voice at fixed interval which drives you crazy l .... Don't go by the numbers.... Do your research then buyIt's an absolute waste of moneyI had to buy new headphones right after buying them
Not comfortable to ears,3.0,"Writing a review after using it for 7 months.Overall a decent product in this price range.Pros:1. Good bass and clarity.2. Almost 5-6 hours of battery backup, though it depends on volume.Cons:1. Not comfortable to your ears.2. Fit is not very good.3. No noise cancelation at all and believe me this is very irritating while taking calls."
"Good earphone,but some design flaws",4.0,Pros:Good sound qualityBattery backup is excellent!! You will love itComfortableand light weightCons:Design is not good compared to other headphone design. Mic kept in the movable wire instead of the neck band makes it difficult in calls if it moves here and there! Also that mic on the wire looks a bit awkward(personal opinion)
"Awesome product, usb rubber cover got damged.",4.0,"Sound from this product is awesome. It has a good buit quality, but when we came to the usb charging port cover it came to tear by regular use. My usb cover starts tearing off from it (may be it was due to my rough usage). Anyway they are claiming it as sports headset,though sport usages will not be a calm one so i noted it here. Otherwise it is good."
Value for money,5.0,Sound quality is very good.Bass is excellent.Its very comfortable in the ears.Its wearable for a long time and doesn't cause any discomfort.But its not very suitable for running purposes.Build quality is very good.Connectivity is excellent.Do buy this if you're looking for a value for money neckband at this price range.This one's totally worth it.
Best wireless headsets,4.0,The headset is awesome. sound quality of headset is good and bass is also good . noise cancellation is great but when i connect with two devices simultaneously i notice a little problems. battery backup is 5 to 7 on full charge. it has also fast charging (20min = 4 hours) support but i recommend use after full charge(it take 1:45 hours) for better battery lifeoverall the product is good!
"Seems I received refurbished one, The quality of sound and the parts are not as in the original",1.0,The original boat-rockers 255 I have experienced from my friend was good. But the received item I received is different from the original. The USB charging port cover is not fixing properly and it has a sharp projection than makes discomfort while wearing. But the original one has a sap fit design and has no projection after insertions. I have uploaded 2 photos of the received item and the original for your ready reference. The sound quality also not as good as in the original. I request for a replacement providing a good one.
Worst product,1.0,I had purchased this on 27 jan 2021 and it stopped worked on 13 feb 2021. Light not on after switch on.  Worst product ever I had purchased. Don't purchase such product. You will pretend after purchase.
I give 5 star.,5.0,"I give 5 star rating because the sound quality is so Cristal clear and the bass is extraordinary. The battery backup is suberb. The neck band is light weight, so you won't feel and the magnetic lock is so useful, so it won't drop from your neck. You have 1 year warranty so no need to worry expect physicall damage.My personal experience my headset not working one side after 8 month usage. I got replacement under warranty within 15 days. So customer service is also good."
Low price. connect appx 3-4 meters but sound quality degraded in 4 months.,2.0,HI Have purchased in Dec2019. the quality is like normal headphone with batter back upto 3-6hrs (depends calls/musics) but now after 5 months the sound output is 10% (not able to hear). submitted request under warranty.  and secondly on boatrockerz warranty request the this model is not listed to submit the claim.. hope they will support....
Good built quality as well as sound,3.0,"I like the product but some how when i open the parcel its box seal is broken. May be some one return the package and they gave me that broken seal package that i dont like, Thats is why i am giving 3 star otherwise product is good."
Poor quality product,1.0,Poor quality product though the sound is good but the product quality is very bad. Poor durability. Last year I had purchased this product and after 6 month left ear speaker has stopped working and after 3 month right side also stopped. Providing 1 year warranty and thia product does not work even for 1 year
Read all review,3.0,"If you but this only for bass boosted sound,Then thus is a good choice.But all-over that's not a Worth of money.Why???üëáüëá-Built quality is very poor.-so lenthy wires.-connectivity issues on very short range.-mic quality is very poor.-all over you should spend 500 more and buy a JBL or any other bot."
"Mediocre, avoid buying these.",2.0,"Headphones have servere connectivity issues  I use the Redmi note 4, the rockerz start having disturbance and voice starts breaking as soon as I keep my phone inside the pocket. Returned the product once 2nd one also had the same issue.Way of keeping them on the neck  with magnet is great.The noise cancellation is pretty good but at the same time is dangerous, it blocks out traffic noise totally.Audio is average, artificial bass dominates everything. Audio quality lacks basic details.Call quality was decent till the time there was no Bluetooth connection issues.Switched to tagg inferno, audio quality is much much better, connectivity problems are close to absent."
Bad Product,1.0,After reading many positive reviews i bought it. Within 2 Months of use i started getting connectivity issues when song is playing suddenly it will get disconnect. I Checked with other phones and Laptop found out headset is the problem claimed warranty. They will provide you a phone number but it wnt work everything is in email though it took 15 days to get my replaced product which i got now i was happy that i got replaced but it didnt last for 10 min too  i felt too bad when my replaced product stopped working in 2nd song itself worst worst worst product. Who will give faulty product for replacement better go for some other option waste of money ......
Awesome product,5.0,"I've been using headphone from 2-3 months it has good sound quality, noise cancellation over calls , little less bass quality, n has real fast charging quality ...it takes 10min to charge upto 50%, bt it beeps frequently when connected to 2 devices that I didn't like about it , otherwise its an awesome product"
Awesome,5.0,"Make sure your device volume is below 10%,before you connect to this sh*  ,if not it blown up yourüëÇ.bass,bass,bass,bass,bass. Go for it. Good noise isolation. Before I'm using boat rockerz400. Little bit lack of treble compare to boat rockerz400. But bass is same."
Good at the price range. Only good not the best.,3.0,First of all amazon should really improve their packaging the box arrived almost in smashed condition. Torn from either sides and my extra earbuds and usb cable were missing. But my rating is not based on that. It's the product. It has great bass but voice clarity and low tones are compromised. May be I am not the right buyer for this product as I don't really listen to high bass songs. Moreover it's a tad uncomfortable to my ear. But at the price range not much to complain. But my product was incomplete thanks to amazon.
Good product for below Rs. 1000,4.0,I am using this headphone for last 1 month. Really a good product in this price range. I have got this in 1000 rs in a sale. This headphone has good build quality and good quality sound. Only one problem is the mic. That dont have good range.
No replacement if headphones stop working after 2 weeks.,2.0,"I ordered these headphones, they went well for the first 2 weeks after which I got them replaced, the replacement piece was even more faultier. There is no way of checking the headphones, and Amazon does not guarantee replacement even if the product is originally in the warranty time slab.It seems like these type of headphones are programmed to stop working after sometime."
Quality of the sound is really awesome. But the company also must look at it's build quality.,4.0,"Well i used boat products before they are good as they were before.pros - base is good , water resistant ( here doscription says IPx4 but my earphone box says IPx5, and that is even better , you should update your product description. ) , Magnet lock , design .Con - cable is a bit long. As it has control box both side and a little hard cable at back, the remaining cable shouldn't be this long.Above all its a good product. Recommend to all the people who wants to buy a cheap but best wireless earphone.5 people found this helpful"

Good sound quality & noise cancellation.,5.0,"I'm writing this review after using the earphones for certain days. The sound quality is really good, you are able to hear the music & every details of it very clearly. Also it is of great use while on call, the sound is very clear. Noise cancellation of the earphones is fairly good. Overall a good product."
Already used and returned product delivered,1.0,"This is not working,  already used and returned product delivered,  waste of money,  not connected to device, don't buy, if you can buy product cleverly checked first, this Bluetooth is connected to mobile with in 10 minutes disconnected, it's regularly,  first I am not checked, not used this Bluetooth,  after few days checked,  return timed out."
Handy and easy to use,4.0,It has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity but the following things disappoints me1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2.Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.3.The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers.

No proper Custcare service from boat..,3.0,It's been  2 months I have mailed as well as complaint by calling for the boat earphone not working still no response.. Very upset with the kind of Custcare services from boat.. So pls think before u buy the product..
"Not water proof it seems, also the charging cable not fitting into the charging slot.",1.0,It says water proof and sweat proof but as the picture shows there is a gap between the connections. I really doubt wheathet it could withstand water or it can be used in rain..Also the charger cable which was sent along with the product is not fitting into the slotüò°...i had to use my phone charging cable!! It seems like a low quality product..
Satisfied,4.0,Its been just 1 day so I'll give my first impressionProduct exactly as shown in imageCrystal clear soundBass is ok...Not that highBuild quality is goodLittle bit uncomfortable after 2-3 hours as im not used to itOnly problem is sound vanishes for a second or two after evry minute or soOverall satisfiedüëç
6 Months report - Battery issue,1.0,"I purchased these earphones on 6 February 2019. It worked great until now. I used it regularly and it gave me 8-10 hours of battery life. Since the last 3-4 days, I am facing the charging issue. It is getting discharged only after 30-45 minutes of playing even though I charge it for more than 1 hour.Update: I reported a complaint with Boat and got a replacement product after around 15 days. The new products stopped charging after around 15 days. Very unreliable and disappointing. I have sent them an email regarding this and still waiting to hear."
Good and value for money,3.0,Perfect iteam but i dont like packaging but the main iteam is pretty goodi am placing this photos of boat to inspire you to buy it good oneSound quality 4.5Packaging 2.5Build quality 4I am editing my review after 1 year now battery back up is very bad and it only get 5 hour backup if it is in medium volumeSo go for oneplus bulletz or realme wireless headphone is better brand
Good battery backup. Can connect to both mobile and laptop/firestick.,4.0,"Been using for few months now.Pros: Battery is good. Can connect to both mobile and laptop/firestick without any issues.Can use while jogging, doing exercises without any issues. Charges faster.Cons: Signals might be unclear for distances greater than 15 feet."
Right earbud stopped working within 1 month,4.0,Battery backup is superb. Was using these earphones only for calling. But right earbud stopped working within 1 month of buying the product.Update:Boat support were really helpful and sent replacement product. Still giving 4 stars as original product stopped working within 1 month.
"Very bad, disappointed",1.0,Not goodOne side earpiece stop workingClaimed warranty but it again stop workingVery badDisappointing qualityAnd after warranty the noise cancellation stop working another person on call always complaint about background noiseGo for any other brand
Connectivity issue,1.0,"This handset has a lot of connectivity issues for calling voice sound while calling is not clear, replace this handset for 5 times but this issues is not yet resolved,my preferences to someone to skip this because it's not worth buying things and keep  replacing continues.its very disappointing dont go with this product,2 time of these products were replaced within 7 days of delivery of replacement"
Please don't buy,2.0,"These wireless earphones have a FAULTY DESIGN. I felt uncomfortable after using them for just 2 minutes. I have used many different brands in the past, but never have I ever encountered such a faulty In-Ear design.Sound & Noise cancellation is good, and being a good brand I hope that it lasts longer.But its faulty design stops me from using it.Please go for higher priced earphones and not this one."
Please don't buy,1.0,"Earphones stopped working in just 2 months and there's no way to contact Manufacturer for claiming warranty. You'll have a number where you'll speak with IVR automated call and it will send you an url which will throw you an error while raising compliant. The same thing applies to email support as well. They will send that URL in email reply. I've sent multiple emails till now, still not received any reply from them.  BOAT is worst manufacturer and weird support. This is happening for the 2nd time for me"
Not worth it...,1.0,"Not worth it... This was my first purchase from mi, and its not worth all the hype that has been created in the market.Overall build quality looked cheap, performance was average. The biggest con is connectivity and battery backup.Go for slightly higher price range and look for a better brand."
Good buy,5.0,"We're using this product for a month now. It's really good. I was using Samsung level U but the wire snapped. This one is pocket friendly, flexible and worth buying. I went by Amazon choice and for the first month I'm really happy. Hopefully it works like this for a long time."
Good but,4.0,Using it from long time and the battery quality is best. Even for whole day use the battery lasts for almost 5-6 days. The neck band could have been more flexible for easy rest on neck. Else value for money
Original range 4 meter. Hook type design in buds cause pain in ear musles.,2.0,"This earphone is good in sound & bass.But problem with this earphone is thier range isVery very very low I try this approx after 2.5 to 3 meter thier sound quality get cancelling.And after 4 meter Bluetooth disconnected from phone.2nd problem is due thier hook type design in buds after 1hour using earphone Continously cause pain in ear muscles, so i need to take 10 minutes break from buds."
Good but expensive.,3.0,"The quality of the product is good. But I‚Äôm buying this product in May 2020‚Äôand at this point the product feels a little to expensive for 1500 bucks. If they could lower the price to 1k , so that the product justifies the price and the competition going around."
Nice,5.0,Nice product from boat I am using this for a year but its sound quality is good after 1 year also. It worth buying.  Its cable is slightly bend after a year and charging cover is broken but it doesn't affect sound quality. I have seen it's playback time is decreased by 1.5 hrs but still it's good deal to buy this
Very worst product ...Don't buy this.,1.0,"After 18 days of purchase, stopped working. Return window on Amazon was closed,so I have to contact boat customer service for warranty. Unfortunately they don't have enough service station in Kerala. Even no office in Ernakulam. Waiting for them after submitting online complaint..Don't know it will fruitful...very bad experience."
Boat Rockerz 255 pro 4star/5star,4.0,"Boat Rockerz 255 pro is Great product.Sound quality  is awesome, Battery  backup is good  9/10,Fast charging  only  45mnt to 1 hour 100%Bielt Quietly good....Thanks Amazon sel this product Wright priceAnd Nice service Amazon......."
For this price I think its good not the best,4.0,"Sound quality is good but lacks noise cancellation. I have used it before too, faced issue in Bluetooth connectivity after sometime while connecting to new device. So overall i will rate it 3.5 out of 5"

Manufacturing defect...,4.0,"Sound quality is good, but not recommended for long time continuous usage....Disconnected frequently after 3 to 4 hrs of continuous use..."
A Better Choice Under 1Küëçüëç !!,4.0,"Straight to the point...Bass - No problem...Sound - Decent sound...Vocals no problem...Treble somewhat...Mic - Ok/AverageComfort - So much Better than 225(wired), which was soooo uncomfortableBuild quality - Good but definitely not for rough use...Charging - came with 100%...Charging port is somewhat tight...Rubber opening make you tensed...Overall a Decent/Good product but only under 1K price !! So look for Dealsüëç"
"Noise cancelling doesn't work properly , May be it doesn't come with noise cancelling",3.0,"Sound quality and bass quality are the best but there is a problem in his mic , there is no any noise cancelling which produce i received but my friends has same product but his product was worked properly . And his noise cancelling is worked properly . I don't know why my boat rockers 255 pro + is not being worked properly that's why i replaced this product ."
Not worthy,1.0,"I got the same earphones as replacement but there was no refund . The sound quality is poor ,very less even at the highest volume to be used in an open environment .no noise cancellation at all . The fitting of ear buds is very loose . Cant use while light workout even . Very very disappointed with the product .Doesn‚Äôt go with the brand image ."
not bad,4.0,the original product was faulty.. had to claim warranty and had it replaced.. the replaced product is working fine but was in different color from the one i originally ordered
A Dissappointed long time Amazon customer.,1.0,"The earphone's rubber hooks fall of easily.Bluetooth stops connecting sometimes when I connect my phone and keep it in my pant pocket.Right side speaker has stopped working completely.The one star is also due to Amazon's service. My product is within the one year warranty period. However, to claim this warranty, I have to submit the Invoice which is not visible when I try to access it through the Amazon app, website or messages.Wehn I click on 'view/print invoice', I get a message that says it is rush hour and traffic is piling up. Plz try again later.."

Be Careful of Seller Sendin A Used Product.,4.0,Ive been a boat rockerz fan for past few yrs now. This was my third boat rockerz. But was disappointed totally when i opened the delivery box. The item seal was already open. When i removed the headphone i saw it full of dirt and was turned brown wid this i knew it was a used one. Third there were no extra earbuds included and boat never does it. I recommend dis headphone but if d seal is broken return it directly
Battery Life issue,2.0,"Using this headphones from 5-6 days and found below issues.1. Battery life is too poor, while using it shows 100% battery but while using battery drained out in 15-20 minutes2. Automatically disconnection of headphone while connected with phone.3. Ears are paining while using the headphones 1 hour or so.4. Battery discharge very quickly.5. While plugin to charge when its 0%, it started showing 100% charged in 15 minutes, that's a CRAP.I have now returned the product back to the seller and call for a replacement. So, its better to be move towards SONY, JBL or Sennheiser Headphones."
This is Not original BoAt,2.0,"The built quality is very bad, and I would recommend you to buy from the boat officials, it is a first copy product not the original"
Fake product received,1.0,The seller is give the copy version of boat product amazon please go through this as I had give the photo u can se those are the same model boat 255 pro the yellow is missing key details is has no noice cancelation and also some basic build up quality I want refund for my product immediately and please amazon dont sell us this duplicate product and also ban thos sellers
Far Below Expectation,3.0,"I was swayed by the numerous reviews, but it is just an average product.  If battery charging is fast, its depletion is faster.  There is nothing that calls for a higher rating."
Poor quality,1.0,Don't buy this product. Ear hooks are too loose to retain. I lost both and couldn't find new. One side stopped working within 3 months. Returned and waiting for replacement for 2 weeks. Too tough to contact customer care.Not a good product n service is too poor.
Won't say great but okay okay,3.0,Sound is okay but there is this constant hissing sound after you pause audio for some 5 seconds  which is kind of irritating. This I found out to be common problem with this model as there were many reviews on YouTube which I discovered after ordering this product. Battery life is amazing though. I would say battery life is all it has in its pro. Everything else is okay okay.
Wrong choice,1.0,"Waste of money, people who all reviewed it as great seems they rated it for no good reason1. Sound quality is extremely poor and it feels like a local headphone which is sold in the market. NOT upto the mark.2. Battery drains in no time, charging hours compared to listening hours will be less."
Worth,5.0,"Good one to buy at this cost.When the battery level is ~20%, Bluetooth connectivity becomes issue. But, battery lasts long and so I faced this issue only twice in past 4 months of usage.Bass is reasonable."
Good Product But Malfunctioning after 1 or 2 months,5.0,It was a nice product. Good Sound Quality and all. but Started malfunctioning when calling. Sounds from d caller get distorted and cant understand at all.. It still working good in otherwise like Audio Video playing from phone..I hav just registered a compalint in d support site (Tocket No : 421323)Hope it will get resolved soon and I can make it a 5 star then..Update : Product got replaced and new one works up to expectations.. thanks for the support..
Value for money !!!,5.0,"Packaging was good.  This is my second bluetooth eargear purchase.  First was many years ago and was always reluctant to buy them again, but this one proves to be best buy.  Sound quality is upto the mark for the price paid.  It was actually more than what i have expected.  Thanks Amazon for getting this product.  Thanks again."
Defective peice,1.0,I can't believe that amazon is selling such defective products.. I trust boat for its product quality and have been using boat earphones since 3 years.. This is the first time i have received such productOne of the earpeice is not working..And even the battery backup is worst.. It's battery drained from 80% to 0% in just 30 min..I requested a return and then even the return was cancelled ... don't know why..
Product is good but after sales service is pathetic,3.0,"the sound signature and product quality is above par in this price range, though the cable length is bit long. but if there is any issue and product is to be serviced during warranty period, then its a really different story altogether.its been more than a month and i am yet to receive my serviced/replaced unit and i dont have any way to get any further update to my ticket and my unit. its strange that the customer care number and support email ids are there, but those are not monitored well it seems."
Its really amazing under this price range,4.0,After over 2 month of useI feel its really amazingSound and bass quality is bestBattery backup also good accordance with this productIf u want to a gaming headset dont go for it because its not a gaming headphoneBut except gaming its really very very good in otherThis is best under this price rangeDont hesitate buy it
Product at its best and quality.,5.0,Bought it at 899.Sound quality is good.More focus is on Bass. You will feel bass.It is best at this cheap prize.Bluetooth connection is good. Wire is long so that allow to use while any activity.For those who wants good product at its best prize can buy.
Average bass,4.0,"The best part about boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ Bluetooth Wireless is its noise cancellation and decent sound quality. Battery is great so far.After some point my ear began to hurt, plus the bass quality is below average. Really want boAt to improve on the quality of bass on its bluetooth neckband products. Overall I would give a 3.5 out of 5."
Nice Product - Highly Recommended!,5.0,"Comfortable to the ears. Sound quality is pretty good:-1. Sound clarity - Excellent. Clear sound.2. Bass - Nice.3. Noise Cancellation - Descent but not 100%.The battery backup is also very well ( as of now, at least, couple of weeks after using it) The design is sleek and trendy.Overall - Recommended!!"
Poor battery life and built quality,1.0,"1) Battery Backup is Pathetic,hardly 4hrs.2) The irritating voice reminder when your battery is below 10% and it works hardly for 10 mins at 10%3) cheap plastic built quality.4) Sound quality is poor,low volume even at max level5) The wire is strong,won't tear off easily6) Go for O n e p l u s earphone ,way better"
earplugs and mic are not comfortable,2.0,"Earphones are canal types which feels heavy on the ears. You can't keep them fitted inside your ear for long. Mic reception is not good, u have to hold it near mouth to function properly. The plastic quality is below average, the earcanals are also of very low quality material. catches too much dust."
Appreciate this product for excellent features and quality..,5.0,Super bass with excellent and clear sound quality... Battery backup is awesome and also contain fast charging features that is make this product too good on this budget... Noise cancelation performance is also better...Thank you boat for providing this product with bunch of excellent features on normal budget
Worth it purchase,4.0,"Boat has a pretty good sound quality and bass. This is great for travelling, gym etc as it does not fall out and has a neck support. The color is a little dim not as vibrant as in the picture, thats a small disappointment for me. Sound quality is good and makes it worth the spend."
Best,5.0,I love it great sound quality and colour is amazing üëç. I was quite skeptical to buy it before because I never purchased electronic stuff online but after I recieved the product every penny was worth it
Worst product damaged in just few days,2.0,"With in fewdays of use, disconnecting automatically. And not working properly...waste of money...if we submit issue to the boat they're simply sending service center number...worst experience will never purchase boat"
Battery backup,5.0,"Boat Rockerz 225 Pro+ the only thing I fell in love is with the battery backup. I charge for one time and it goes for 3days max to max. If I say about the sound, it's also cool. But somewhere there you'll find some kind of noise disturbance still it's is okay. Passive voice cancellation is not there. Looks still good.Worth buying!!"
Not Good,2.0,Sound quality is great compared to Realme earbuds I used before.Decent battery backup and quick charging.Earbuds magnet are very weak.Edit: Very bad built quality.Sometimes no audio on right side.Discharges fast.
Value for Money wireless earphone,5.0,"Superb quality wireless earphone ever used, best sound quality to listen music,voice calling and noise cancellation is also perfact.Fits perfact in ear and suoerb battery life for fullday use.The only one thing i didn't like is loose rubber support, it can be lost easly at anywher."
No noise cancellation at all.. only good for hearing songs,2.0,"The bluetooth is really good for listening music. To use it for calling, you have to be in an isolated place so that the other person can hear you clearly. If you are in a public place or even at home it will capture all other sounds very loudly but not yours. Only buy if you are going to use it for listening to music. It will not disappoint you there. It has good bass, treble and vocals."
Very good product,5.0,Sound quality is awesome however noise cancellation needs some work. Blietooth connectivity is also seamless. Battery life is good. Using since last 15 days now. No fuss about carying your phone around when you are moving  20-25 feed
"No Vibration call alert, Buttons placed Inconvenient",3.0,"Almost 1 week Battery backup is gooddisadvantage is..1. No Vibration call alert, it must need when we drive bike and phone kept in pant pocket2. Buttons placed Inconvenient - Call attend button is at right side wire, whenever we receive call, we difficult to find the call attend button.Both of the above is regular use. but inconvenient.otherwise ok"
Really suprised me,5.0,I didnt expect this much from boat.I got this for 1499Sound quality is good and the Bass is deep( great)Fits so perfectlyButtons are very reliableBattety is good (  only used for 2 days)Its very worthy on this budget...Honest review
Got duplicate product in replacement.,1.0,Firstly i ordered this product and sound quality was pretty good.But because of some issues (sound disturbance) I replaced this product and in replacement i think i've got duplicate product.I just applied to return this product.1)Shipping box is damaged2)product is damaged too (button for lower the volume is always pressed) (clearly visible in image)3) sound quality is too poor.
Honest review üåö,4.0,It's a good purchase! ‚ù§I have purchased boat 225 and it is going good till now and 2 years have passed of purchasing that product..I also have purchased boat rockerz 400 and it's also running good till now and it has been 2.5 yrs now!So i am expecting this kind of durability from this üòã.. And my expectation has been matched with this! üòäAnd this ocean blue colour is superb‚ù§üí´
worst customer service,2.0,"The product is fine , it started giving problems after 6 months but the major issue is customer service of boat. That is pathetic they neither reply on mails nor pick calls .people working at service centres they even dont know about their another services  not at all helping . Never gonna purchase boat product ever again ."
Choose BOULT over BOAT. This is waste.,1.0,Worst Bluetooth earphones ever. Go for BOULT anytime. Bluetooth connectivity fails even when you go 5 feet away from your cell. I remember using my Boult earphones from bedroom till hall without any problem. Sound breaks even when ur cell is in ur jeans back pocket. Worst battery backup..Boult kills boat here as well. I bet you will get a feeling or using wire earphones..bcz dts d max range it can perform average.Do not buy and then regret.
Good product but I can't hear sometimes,4.0,"I can't hear sometimes when I just connect with this during call, it takes me two times to cut the call and call back again, and sometimes can't hear for a second in regular intervals when listening to music or watching something when I have the earphones connected but haven't used it for a certain time like two or three hours."
"Too much Bass, makes the ear ache",2.0,Too much bass. Not good when listening to low frequency voice. I have to turn it max to hear. Uncomfortable. Ear starts to ache because of the fit.battery backup poor upto 4hours of use then turns off
I need replacement. Customer Number Provided is Fake. FAKE REPLACEMENT WARRENTY. DONT BUY,1.0,"Its been 4 months. It worked fine, but now there is some problem on left side ear phone. Cant hear anything from there.Customer Number Provided is Also Fake. Trying to on that from 19th Apr till today cant reach anyone.Now how do i request for change of headphone??"
Fast charging with superb music experience,5.0,I thought of buying 255 but instead bought 255pro during sale. Got it at 1249. If you can spend extra 300 for 255pro then just go for it. 255 pro has fast charging as oppose to 255f which takes 3.5 hours to full charge .255pro takes around 40-50minutes to charge from 0 to 100. Happy with amazon delivery as well.
Would not recommend,1.0,"Although it's a great product, still would never recommended this to anyone because within a span of 2 months, one of them stops working. And i am saying it because i have had an experience with boat two times back to back and in both, one of the speaker stopped working. Think before you buy."
Sound Quality is Good & Value for money,5.0,Music Sound is good - 3 out of 5Calling Sound is good - 4 out of 5Noise Cancellation - 4 out of 5Bass Quality - 3 out of 5
BoAt ... rocking sound but less comfort and mic capability,4.0,Writing after use of 10 months...Sound quality 8/10Bulid 8.5/10Comfort 7/10Battery 6/10Looks 8/10Mic 7.5/10Durability 8/10Overall a very satisfying product under ‚Çπ1k
Not a Commuters earphone at all,2.0,this product is not at all a commuters product marketed as a sports earphone this earphone lags when walking and phone in pant pocket that doesnt means i hold my phone in my hand everytime amd walk or keep it near my stomach side so the connection is not interaputed i bought boat rockerzz 255 then replaced it the one was also performing the same so i came to a conclusion this is not a commuters earphone.
Reliable - great product at great price,5.0,"I bought it for 999,I purchased it second time, gifted to my colleague. This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time. I connect laptop and mobile both. when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continuously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear."
"Average, not too great",3.0,"The earphone built quality is good. But sound is average. Also, you have to manually connect and disconnect everytime. Whereas the Realme earbuds automatically connect and disconnect when you open. I would recommend to go for realme earbuds instead of this."
Excellent but producing them in india would have been better,4.0,"Using this headphone for the past 15 days. Sound, Noise cancellations, battery life, and build quality is OK. As they are designed and marketed by an Indian company which produces other models of these headphones in india they should consider shifting the manufacturing altogether back to India from china. This will certainly improve the image of the brand as they will stand out from other Chinese built products."
DO NOT BUY READING THIS GOOD REVIEW.. IT'S FAKE..,1.0,"It was not work even two months..and that warranty is a joke..They will not receive your call..SO DO NOT BUY THIS,SAVE MONEY..I don't want to give it one star also.."
awesome,5.0,"after buying a headset from one of the big brand...and boat was a releiver...big brand product disappointed a lot. Boay has great quality with a reasonable price.. once charged, it will go for long time..."

Why can't you sell a for product in working condition. This is not fare. Please either return the amount or else provide me the new one in working condition. Worst product I got ever in amazon. Does amazon not checking the quality before delivering to customer. Please reply.
Not worth spending 1500  - Pathetic Customer Service,1.0,"Hi,Bought this product some time back. Worked normally for 3 months, and then suddenly stopped charging.Raised a complaint against the product for a replacement as it was still under warranty, boat guys picked up the shipment for return but never provided the replacement item.Pathetic Customer service. I have been trying to call them for a week now. Contact number is either switched off or they are on leave."
For Bass lovers.,5.0,"Product arrived in well package and surprisingly it was delivered on the day before tentative date. This product is only for Bass lovers, more over Batteey back up is also good. I bought this product only for good bass and battery backup, type C ( while any one can charge with mobile charger) as I already have 235V2, now am going to use 255+ pro for primary use."
Good product at this price point,4.0,"Good product overallI am a bass lover so I would not rate this product good.. rest all things like charging ,comfortable , call clarity is very good at this price point."
üî•üî•Best Blutooth Earphone at this Price Rangeüî•üî•üëç,5.0,"Literally best blutooth earphone under this price range i got this for 999 only. The sound quality was awsom, Base is too good, pairing with mobile is also very easy, call quality is also very nice & works upto 30 feets from smartphone noice cancellation is ok, the earlock is also soft and can be removable. In my openion just go for it if you are getting it under 1000üëçüî•üî•"
Review after 6 months usage.,3.0,"Writing the review after using it for six months.The earphones was good till 4 months but the battery life has deteriorated considerably. It goes from 60% to 20% suddenly. Apart from battery life the fit is also not suitable for long usage,it hurts the ears.Only upside is the BASS. Sound quality is medium,nothing great. Its easy to pair and not bad range.I would recommend the wired boats rather than this."
Not the best but better.,5.0,"Good quality sound, noise cancelling is better but not the best. The length of the headphones is little too much (With respect to my beady size) . Battery back up is not good (up to 1 and half days backup is what I am getting)"
Good value for money,4.0,"Bass is superb, sound quality also good. Battery is monstrous. Look is not premium. Noise cancellation not good. Overall a value for money. Can't find any better in this price range. I bought it for 1300.Pros- good battery 10/10Superb bass 10/10Sound 8/10Cons- no premium looking4/10Noise cancellation5/10No magnetic on/off"
Okay okay,3.0,"Mine got damaged after a year. Very dissapointing. The music was alright.  Bluetooth is also okay-okay. It's more like if you have a small budget and need these, you can try but if you have a decent budget, other options must be explored."
Worst warranty services ever,1.0,"Worst warranty service provider ever...after 4months of use left side speaker is not working. I claimed for replacement , they pick up my product bt after that there was no update. It is one month from the pick up date still not solve my issue. I search on Google and found very bad review against the company. There are many people who does not get their replacement till 3 months. Also their customer care contact no. Is not working. I am too much disappointed with their services.Sound is good...bass also gd..best feature is connected with two devices at the same time."
After replacement  recived product different,1.0,Don't buy this product my 9 months experience after 4 months one side Bluetooth not working after that I register complaint about this for replacement and product pick up and goes for replacement and even  1month not replaced afterthat I again complaint to indian  consumer app then they dispatched my product but I received wired headphone where as I gives product for replacement is this Bluetooth during this more  disappointedWrist services from imagica marketing's ltd
Best,5.0,"Have been using these for an year now.Except for noise cancellation, bass , clarity everything is good.Durabality of these are very great.have been using this atleast for 10 hrs a day."
wireless boat headphones but problem,4.0,"best product within rs 1000, battery back up over 6 hrs after full charge, extra bass headphone with good audio.But problem started after 3 months use. Volume up/down button not working. Send to service centre. Waiting for response after 15 days of dispatch.."
Good to have with...cons defined,4.0,"Good to have this,Cons:1.ear bud sometimes irritating2.supporting ear rubber is only 1 piece and can be ditatched easily3.battery backup is not good..when it will shouts last 80 percent battery remains means  we only left 20 mins or so...4 .magnet is not that strong as it should be"
Solves the purpose,4.0,"Sound quality is good, but sometimes there is a crackling noise and also there is a extra air noise from mic while riding bikes, even when not in use."
"SEEMS GOOD, BUT TOO EARLY, AS I have started using it for less than a week time.",4.0,"I have started using this for under a week time. But as far as my opinion is concerned it gets perfectly charged. Proper connectivity, No noise issues."
Value for money!!!,5.0,"The best part of this WBH is, it gives a clear and a deep bass with a clear and ample output of treble. Built quality at the par. And Seriously it is for rigorous workout. And i bought for 999‚Çπ,which is totally worth(Value for money).But a bluetooth range is a bit less which can be neglected in such a budgeted price range..(100-200 zada lele bhai bus bluetooth range badha de)!!!!"
All good except mic calling should shout,3.0,"Pros-Good to hear music, battery life is good for me I put 30min charge it lasts 1 to 1and half day with hearing 1hr music, 1hr calls, 3hr movie, bass is superb.Cons-Mic is not good for calls its like i should hold it like wired earphoneMagnet feature is good but colour near them gone by using it in just 1week looks oddIts good to use when we stand but not when we laydown.."
BASS BOOST ITEM WORTHY,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†BATTERY BACKUP :- 4 STARBASS :- 5 STARBUILT QUALITY :- 3 STAROVERALL WORTHY FOR MONEYBEST FOR BASS LOVERS"
Good one,4.0,"I used this neckband for at most 2 weeks , I found when bluetooth and WiFi is ON in phone, the WiFi network is getting dropped. I assume that could be issue on my device, but later found this is happening same on my laptop. I don't know if it was WiFi or neckband issue. So now I can not use neckband, just because WiFi connection get dropped and it impacts my work from home job. I think, software update is needed on chip set. Rest it works fine, upto satisfaction level"
Good headphone on a budget,4.0,"Have been using for a month in gym and day to day whatsapp calls. Works well if you are charging on a laptop. Dont plag directly mobile chargers as most of the headphones are not able to handle the power.Quality is just OK, but will do the job."
"Defective Product , Worst sound quality , connectivity issue",1.0,"Pathetic Sound Quality, most important is this people are selling manufacturing defects on online ,i just received it today when i checked the same day left ear piece is not working at all , first it took 3 hours to get connected ...worst ProductPlease DONT buy BOAT products"
Poor durability.,2.0,"After using 6 months suddenly one side of the ear is not working.  I claimed the warranty, they issued new product. That product also suddenly one side not working after 5 months. Then again I raised warranty claim, they send the another new product.  Now its working for more thaan 6 montha, donno when it will goes to non-working."
Good and affordable,4.0,I ordered this on jan 2021 and am writing this review after 9 months use.. For this price range (800 around i think) its a good bluetooth headset. I won't recommend this headset for calling purpose because the caller on the other side can hear every bit of background noise than our voice..so its actually disturbance to them.. for music games n all its okay
Worth it...,5.0,"Got it within 24 hours from the time of Order. Great product, great sound.As I purchased it for usage during bike riding, while riding little difficult to maintain the voice calls, because like other earphones, mic can't be placed near your mouth and opposite person will hear very low voice and other vehicle sound will be heard too high.The strap has to be placed near the neck which is bit far from the mouth to reach out the voice.Rest everything is wonderful and fine.Go for it."
Value for money,4.0,"Product is too good within this price range. The hanging control panel feels slightly odd but according to its battery life and other features, it is manageable. Overall value for money product. But packaging was too poor and seal was also broken. But product was untouched and without any scratches."
Almost fine in all aspects except fitting over neck while riding two wheelers,4.0,"I am totally satisfied with the sound quality, durability, noise cancellation mic and finally battery was awesome but as a bike rider I am not going to suggest this one as it doesn't fitting to our neck when we ride two wheeler.When we r driving the band behind the neck  is going back for air which is totally uncomfortable for user and pilon on the bike.For my Samsung galaxy MAX through this bluetooth headphones i can't use Google assistant as I not supporting for my device, I am not sure this problem is for everyone or not"
Nice bluetooth earphones .,4.0,"This earphones are way too good as though of bluetooth devices. Sound latency is also not seen during usage , had a good experience while gaming, bass is good, and overall the sound quality is very good keeping price in mind, the only negative I found in it is the short battery it can be a bit more."
Excellent Super Bass and and noise cancellation very comfort to wear,5.0,Excellent sound excellent noise cancellationand excellent bass I would love to buy again for my sister fantastic deal at 999üò¢the only thing I I want that boat Rockers is missing that if headphone is connected then it doesn't vibrate for call just giving a reminder incoming call but overall very much value-for-money very much comfort to wear excellent battery backup
Consistently Fails after 3 months,2.0,This is my fourth earphone which has failed right at the 3 month mark. Service people also are irresponsible and just give you a replacement which also fails. Look elsewhere. boAt isn't what it used to be. But it sounds good while it lasted. Second to none.
Decent buds,3.0,It's a good product for the price but if you are expecting to amazing sound quality then it's not for you it's a decent package but mid and lows are lacking bass is power full sound is clear backup is good and that's it! I personally am fan of Sennheiser but this is way more cheaper then that so decide for yourself and yeah it's better that jbl in this price range...
Good product,3.0,U need to charge continuously. After 15 min charging it will work 1 hr max..  regarding sound and colour is just Superb.. I am bit disappointed in charging capacity only..It's ok product.. The one who wants high Volume they can go for this product.Overall.. it's okay type..
Got it for ‚Çπ1299 and it's worth it.,4.0,Overall it's everything is ok. Please don't mind the negetive reviews. They are comparing a ‚Çπ1299 headphone with 12000 headphones that's ridiculous. If you are comparing compare an apple with Apple. You get what you pay for. Those who are planning to buy it don't think twice just order it now. You won't regret it. If you are looking for in ear headphones.
Boat Rockerz got dysfunctional just in one month,1.0,"My boat rockerz got dysfunctional in just a month. I don't know whether I got defected piece or what but its speakers are not working now in just a month. this is really annoying. All my money is wasted. Also, I don't have  a returning option now. This is not accepted from such a big brand boat and amazon."
Muddled sound quality. BASS eats up the vocals and highs doesnt exist,2.0,"Built Quality wise its very good.Sound quality bass overpowers vocals and highs. Coz of highs missing and medicore mids when watching movies voices feel muddled and its painful to listen clearly anything at all.. same will calls too.. very very bad unbalanced sound, just good bass is present.."
Great User Experience,5.0,"Quality is great, the cord is longer than normal and headphones have held up for months of hard use at gym, running etc. with no damage whatsoeverSound is warm and full, the highs are not annoying and the bass isn't overemphasized which allows you to listen to them over extended periods of time. Probably the best sounding pair of in ear headphones I've ever owned"
One of the worst earphones ever used....,1.0,This is not a product worth buying used for 2 days now returning.... While playing music there is some disturbance in between(like sssssssssss)... Sometimes buttons don't work and while playing pubg mic doesn't work... Mic quality is poor.... Fit is not good... While driving it started to get away in air... Sound quality is very poor while playing something on low volume... Sometimes feels noisy.... All in all only noise cancellation is good ...... Otherwise it is not worth buying never go for it.... Never.....
Discounted are Definately referbished products,2.0,"All the discounted headphones are referbished. I bought two and both after few months started having issues in one or both ear piece. When opened, the inside of both are having different types of packing and wire length had already given that hint."
low calling volume issue,4.0,"i am ussing boat rockerz 255 pro plus.calling volume is very low, i am very disappointed due to calling volume performance, i have to need more concentration to litsen incoming call voice in traffic area even in silent area.can you solve my low volume calling earpiece sound issue,except this battary backup, music base, mic rang is very good."
Cannot be compared with professional audio companies,3.0,Bass and sound quality isnt that great. This product doesnt work after 4-5 months but am happy to buy another as within warranty you get a brand new product delivered at your doorstep.
I love it,5.0,It is having very good bass effect. Overall Experience is execellent
Not so good,2.0,The sound quality is good. But the biggest problem is when u r on phone call it catches background voice on over side.
There are better options,4.0,Good but keeps disconnecting sometimes when the phone is in my pocket. Also option to navigate through the songs is limited. Also not sure if the product delivered was a 2nd hand one judging by the package condition. I think better to buy from shop after inspection of seal and every thing.
Worth it,5.0,Best wireless ear phones at this price bracket.Will give you 3.5 hours of on time.15 minutes of charge will give you atleast 1 hour.Sound is normal don't expect much at this price bracket.All functionally working as they have mentioned. Except belowDon't try to connect with multiple devices otherwise this will surely hang or doing some strange behavior.
Pros and cons,4.0,Pros -1. Sound quality is superbb2. Mic is best3. Size and fitting is also bestCons-1. Battery backup is only 4-5 hrOverall Quality is best
For loud music lovers,5.0,High bass and very loudThese pair of Bluetooth headset is great with dual connectivity... We can connect two Bluetooth at a time... KudosWith these earphone you cannot be disturbed with outer sounds while enjoying musicFinally my words are terrific purchase
Noise cancellation should be outgoing too!,3.0,"It's great in every way -- except -- the person who I'm talking to can hear all my background noises more than my own voice.  Noise cancellation is good for incoming -- I hardly hear sounds when listening to music - but background sounds are not cancelled out, which is a huge minus."
Ok for walking or general use...,3.0,"This is only for walking, runners will have problems keeping this thing inside their ear. Okiesh base, notes really burst at highs, lows are ok, ok for a purchase if u are planning for general use or for walking purposes... runners stay away"
Pathetic customer care service,1.0,"I had order one of these earphones that stopped functioning within 5 months. I asked for a replacement since it was within warranty period. They delivered similar product that wasn't working either. Tried calling customer care but they are not taking call since then. Only once did the call connect to a female in customer care cell, the last literally cut the call as I started explaining it to her. Didn't expect such a pathetic service at your end. Would not recommend it to anyone."
Cheap Quality Earphones Stopped Working within 10 days,1.0,"Horrible experience. The earphones stopped working within 10 days. Plus you have to go to the service center for any replacement which is so far that it is not worth it. This is the second time this is happening, even three months back I bought Boat wired earphones and they stopped working within two months. 10/10 WON'T recommend this brand."
Mic doesnot work properly during calls/meetings,1.0,"Mic stopped working properly after 15 days of purchase, when on call, people are unable to hear your voice. You need to keep shouting and remain very very very close to the bluetooth device. I mainly purchased it for meetings so purpose is failed."
Perfect!!,4.0,I bought this for 999 during prime day sale.. want to bug another one but not getting with the same price.. although waiting for it to come down.. if y are thinking to take a Bluetooth headset here it is.. worth more than the money paid for..
Rubbish,1.0,"Rubbish , money waste, no noise cancellation, i purchased it keeping in mind abt so many positive reviews... i was so sure abt getting it but after a week or so, it started giving trouble.. 200rs mi earplugs are far faaaar better thn this. I wasted my money, you dont do it!! Dont go by the reviews, i am shocked how it got too many p+ reviews"
Impressive Headphn in this Price.,4.0,"1.Sound Quality:-Bass is enough to enjoy music. But lack of clearity .It is better than BaultAudio wireless. But in this price it is aswme.4.8/52. Noise cancellation:-Good and premium quality ears buds. If you use it long time, the sporty style of extensions can feel some pain in ear.3.8/53. Bluetooth Connectivity:-As per description, it maintains 3M distance.4.8/54. Water resistant:-Don't use during rainy season.  It is water resistant not pure waterproof.4/5"
Not efficient for the price,3.0,"Have been using it for a month now, it is not efficient compared to its price, it hangs, it won‚Äôt connect sometimes. Not fast and efficient compared to the price charged"
Genuinely saying don't purchase this headphones.,1.0,"Previous version is better then this one.These are the promblems with version 2:-1.Takes too much time to connect to phone.2.Battery drains too fast.3.There is a delay in response whenever we use buttons on headphones.4.It disconnects now and then, as this problem is with every wireless boat headphones."
Too good device.,5.0,"I'm in love with the product.The only thing which creates an issue is when I use it while riding my bike, it flies away.So BOAT should have given something to tie it around neck.Rest.. all is well."
My expectations of BOAT sank,1.0,Expectations hurt.. Ive used mi wireless Bluetooth headsets with super bass.. Jbl and sony. While nothing so far was of the sony level this boat is way below regular standards.. Bass is not upto the mark or almost absent.. To top it off within 48 hours post delivery the left side stopped working ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è hope the replacement is worth the wait.
Excellent sound and clarity.,5.0,Excellent sound and clarity. I am just enjoying with BoAt Rockerz 255.  If you want to enjoy just go ahead. I am strongly recommending.
Excellent product,5.0,"Great sound quality. I have one Plus 8T and rather than buying ctype headphones üéß, bluetooth headset is a way better choice, yes it's costly but Worth the price.. highly recommended"
A one Boat Rockerz,5.0,"I bought it just like that without much idea or research about the product. However, it was a surprisingly amazing performance by it that all my family members asked me to get it for them. This is my third boat rockerz and I feel this is second to none in its price category. Kudos to the production line and design."
Worth buying at this price !!,5.0,"Too good to have it in such price.. although it's too early to comment on every specs since I have bought this only 4 days back.Till now no issue found and having gr8 experience. Sound quality superb, battery still not reached to half though have listened to music more than 5 hrs til now. Only problem is you will experience little ear pain if you put on the ear bud continuously more then an hrs time."
this sound quality and build quality.,4.0,"this product use for 1 month,and like the sound quality,material and manufacturing.this is good product  I will charge 1 hour and battery backup 24 to 30 hour time .but this product is 200 to 300 hundred costly I suggeste loss prize this product and All OVER THIS PRODUECT IS OWSAM AND DUREBEL LIFE TIME"
Extremely poor sound!!!!!,1.0,"This is pethetic, it's doesn't offer any sort of sound fedelity, feels like you are listening from a speaker by hands, trebel is extremely bad and bass sound is muffled, it's only good for calling.If you are looking something cheap and only for calling, ps Bluetooth connectivity is also below average, frequently disconnects while cycling."
Not so great,3.0,"I did not like the sound of the device too much (bass is not too much as the other reviews claim).  Mine had problems connecting to multiple devices,  I had to switch it off and then switch it on everytime I want some it to connect to multiple devices. Battery backup is only about 5 hours"
Quite happy. using continuously since last three months.,5.0,"Sound quality, noise cancellation, and bass quality all good. I have given 4 marks in every category. Quite happy.Very good. Worth buying. Really it works for 40 hrs. I am using continuously since last three months."
Worst battery,1.0,"I don't know about you guys, but I am really dissatisfied with  the earphones I received. The biggest issue is of battery backup. I charge it 100% percent to get it drained out automatically without even connecting with my device in about 6 hours only. About noise cancellation it's not up to mark. Battery issue is biggest issue please do something about it."
Value for money. Best sound quality at this price.,4.0,"Best deal if you are getting it under 1500. They are easy to use and sound quality is exceptionally good, which is least expected at this price. The built is such that they don't easily fit in any carry case especially not in the one which is mentioned in bought together catagory. The battery time is great but the info regarding the percentage battery left can be deceptive as displayed. One moment it displayes 60 % and next moment it's exhausted. But the backup is great . Can be listned for more than 4 hours when connected"
Bluetooth doesn't pair easily,2.0,It's a Brand but it's bluetooth doesn't pair easily... Bought 3 days earlier... bluetooth doesn't shows bluetooth is not discoverable.....Pairs to one divice and doesn't pair easily to another until clicked upon forget boat rockers ....Trying to use it one more day and will return if problem persist
Connecting problem very bad quialty please don't bay,1.0,This is very uncomfortable to wear as it is large in size.It's laterally coming out of the ears.You can't ware helmet while wearing this.it is more bad more painful.Bass is too loud... instrument separation is bad.Not worth the price.Only colour of the product is best...and rest of the things are worst.Go for another one.
Best wireless headphone,5.0,I like the build quality of this product and the battery life is awesome and while doing workout comfortness is good but I felt sound quality is not upto the mark while comparing out boat with wire  headsets like 225 only thing is the Boss is not that much good other than that awesome awesome product I got a good deal
"NOT WORKING, DEFECTIVE, APPEAR TO BE USED SOLD AS NEW, CABLE IS HAVING A CUT",1.0,cheated by sellersend defective product which was not working appears to be usedon inspection found a cut in the cablealso the packing appeared to old having dust particles on it
Acceptable,4.0,"Sound quality goodCall mic quality not very good, but Ok. Person at other hear our voice like we talking from far away.Somehow does not allow or support conference calls.Battery backup good, charge fast."
Sound quality is awesome.,5.0,Sound quality is awesome...very comfortable to use...battery life is also good enough...easy connectivity...battery percentage can be seen on mobile screen thats the thing i liked the most ... overall its a great product from boat....go for it...
"Lightweight, easy to use",4.0,"It works perfectly when connected to phones but the laptop hangs for the first two connections. Liked the product for its lightweight, easy operation to volume.Cons: charging point of headphone - It's very tiny and need to be very careful while charing"
Waste of money on purchase of this product,1.0,You are not able to hear Sound from One side of the product after 2-3 months of purchase. Waste of money
No mic. Still this product appeared in search for bluetooth headphone and mic,2.0,I wanted a bluetooth product for headphone and mic both. And this product appeared in the search as well. So I ordered it. Now I get to know that this does not have mic. My purpose of online session doesn't solve with this. I raised a return request but no response. Thus writing this in review.
Good quality with best price,5.0,Sound and bass quality was really good . This review was updated after usage of two to three months from bought. I was dissatisfied with the battery backup. It seems to good as mentioned battery backup but it was some difference in the usage. But it was worth for that money to buy best quality wireless earphone
Great product,5.0,"The product is light and of great quality. The only bad thing about the product is that the long presses are too long almost 5 sec long. And when it turns on or off, it takes its time to announce 'youve tuned into boatrockers, you've tuned into Nirvana's and 'adios amego' while a blip would have done the job.May be I am not as hip as the current generation.Otherwise a great product and at a great price. I gifted one to my friend too."
Duplicate or first copy,1.0,Be aware getting duplicate product even from amazon.Getting boat rockerz 255 today.But seems like seller sold me a duplicate of frist copy cheap product not original one. The length of wire to neck bend to ear buds is uneven and symintrical with right earbud to left earbud. Even sound quality is too low.I don't believe that amazon delivered me duplicate product.
Not a good Product,1.0,"Not a good Product, audio stops automatically sometimes while playing audio/video.Bluetooth connectivity is not good either..Advertisement says it can be used while workout. But truth is - a little movement is enough for affecting audio quality..Sound Quality is also minimal.Disappointed with the product..waste of money."
Amazing device with all the features at the same time.,4.0,Boat Rockerz Pro plus helped me a lot in my workouts like jogging and cardio exercises by producing a great sound to my ears. Same time it plays a vital role in meeting via laptop and phone also as it can be paired with 2 devices. Great  device with amazing features in 1200. Go for it guys if you don't have so much technical expectation from the product.
Difficult to use for long time,1.0,Having pain when in use for more than 1 hour....No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.
Full review after long use,1.0,Worst earphones Ever bought.1. So much noise to another person if using for call2. Pain in ear so can't use for long3. Connectivity is too poor even cell in pocket and getting drops.4. Overall don't go for it if you love comfort.
Decent bass effect but submerged vocals.,4.0,"The product built quality is okays, not as good as Realme Bluetooth earbuds, & sound quality is also average. It has good bass effect but the vocals are submerged due to bass. It doesn't have Cristal clear sound like Sennheiser cx 180 or cx 213. I am returning the product as I am not enjoying listening music on it. Amazon service is great product got delivered within 2 days."
Never buy,1.0,"Bought 2 sets after seeing reviews here...1.stopped working within 1 week,the next one stopped working in around 1.5 months...worst purchase from amazonGave 1 star bcos i couldn't find a lesser rating"
Beast!,5.0,"¬∂ boAt name itself is enough coz it doesn't let anyone compromise in any of its features.¬∂ Only one thing disappointed me is its design and build quality. Dust easily accumulate on it and also when I put it on, it looks little wierd.¬∂ If only music is what matters to you, then it's a gem, trust me! Skull candy, Jbl and all are just famous names, the real king is boAt!"
using from 1 year review.,5.0,I am using this product from last 1 year. I use it daily at least for 3 hrs.  the product is as good as newly packed even after one year. After 1 year of usage the battery backup is still more than 7 hours.  I used it for 3 days in a single full charge.  the awesome build quality makes this  perfect one. i will surely recommend this product who is looking for long run in less money.  i wish to give more than 5 stars  but there is only 5 stars available to rate.
"Not made for calls, Worst.",2.0,"The sound is good but the connectivity is worst. While I was on a call the the other person was not able to hear me at all.Do not buy if calling is your purpose, if you want it for music only, then go fot it."
Eco problem during call,2.0,This is my replacement order and facing same issue. Other person can't here my voice properly during the call via Bluetooth. They can only here background disturbance even i sit in room. Eco problem! Deciding to return and order some other brand. This is only good for music.
Do not buy. Worst product. Stopped working 2nd time.,1.0,"Do not buy. Worst product. Stopped working for the second time.Ordered it on 15th July, product was delivered on 16th.One side of the earbud stopped working in first week of Oct 2019. Got it replaced from the company. For users information, company allows ine time replacement warranty.Now since the product I use is already replaced earlier, the product is out of warranty.Rs.999 I spent on this product is a complete loss to me."
DO NOT GO FOR THIS.,1.0,"Do NOT go for this. Bought it thinking about the company and it's supposedly nice features. First 4 months, Everything was fine. Noice cancellation was good. But the 5th month, without any warning the right side stopped working. Morning it was fine. Evening spoilt. It was exactly in the Same place where I had kept it. No wire cut. Nothing. Just like that. Paying so much we expect it to be durable for atleast an year. But 4 months??! It's absurd. I do not recommend this to anyone. Waste of money. Nonsense"
Not as expected,3.0,Infinity glide 120 more better. It doesn't have neither good sound quality nor the proper bass. Only a voice is coming out even in most melodious song.
Worth it...,4.0,"Nice product. Packaging was worst. When i received its messed up in plastic packet, but its working. No tracking available till i get the product.Amazon should improve these things.Otherwise boat is nice brqnd value for money.  I got it for ‚Çπ999 in sale. Worth it."
"Rating -3.5, Good product for  Rs 999.",3.0,Overall Product rating is average but good at this price point (999).Packing is very bad. It seems like a second hand product as the pack is almost damaged but no issues for the headset.Sound quality is average. I can give a 3.5 rating for the sound quality. Built quality is good but the long wire is annoying. Design is not as good as other products in this price range.Bluetooth connectivity seems fine. I didn't have any issues yet.Overall I can give a 3.5 rating.
Painful to ears,3.0,"Sound quality of the product is very good , Paring takes 30 seconds, amazingly easy . The biggest problem is in the zest to increase the bass , manufacturer has increased the overall diameter of the speaker , this when covered with rubber gloves is tight to ears and start to hurt after 20 , 30 minutes of usage . I felt the design to fit in on all types of ears is not universal , could have been of better design , i could not use them after 20 min due to an uneasy feeling and pain"
Connectivity issue,4.0,Some times am facing connectivity issues.. Not getting connected to both phone and other device in dirst attempt.. Its little upsetting when i have to spend time to get it connected or even detected.. Also checked if the phone has BT issues using other devices.. But its not the case..
"Bass was not so good , not for pubg",3.0,"I like design, bass is not so good, what they told us , it is average, sounds was good not awesome and battery backup is not more than 5hr , NOT FOR PUBG PLAYERS, BECAUSE enemy foot print is coming late which is not good for attacking purpose, you will definitely confuse while open the door or by hitting by enemy bullet , they , and it is  so expensive in Amazon, if you want to bus the same product go for snapdeal, where you need to pay 777‚Çπ just half ."
don't buy waste of money and time,1.0,All are good only it will work for 3 mnths from the date of purchase after 3rd month one side will not work..Please if any one is Interest o buy this don't waste your money my humble request they will give less price but it worth of only 2 monthsCustomer care also worst all are giving very fake hope on the replacement..Pls don't buy this product
Type A point,4.0,"The neck band is good but the yellow wire(cable) is very poor ,it always bends,if it was a round cable type wire like 1+buds it would be better....And the battery backup is 6 hrsAnd they should have given type C ,but they gave type A ...Good quality in the sound...Can go for it in this price..."
Decent vfm,4.0,"Purely from an audiophile perspective, these headphones aren‚Äôt greatHowever if you are looking for decent sound on a budget, these are brilliant, bass is good, treble is a bit on the lower side, the fit in the ears is a compromise"
Overall Ok product. Bass quality is not good as I expected.,3.0,Bass quality: You've to be at full volume or one level below to experience the bass effect which I really don't like to maintain.Range: Good range of Bluetooth connectivity. Sometimes I experience distortions in sound (Songs) quality even when my phone is in pocket.Battery: Very good battery backupUsage: You may feel it a little bulky to use. Earphones holds well in ears with good convenience
Working good,5.0,"Buy it without any doubt, guys believe me I wrote it after the use of 3months ,,it gives u wings when u keep it..One thing is happened with me this feels me very bad that ear Bud's holding rubber cap is loosed due to which i loose it...so plz tell me how to buy the accessories of boat rockerz...I also attach second pic which show clearly right ear holding rubber missingüòû"
Poor quality designed to work for 2weeks.,1.0,In just 10 days one side of ear phone not working. Where is the quality. Simply dumping bad products output to us through Amazon. Waste of money
Thanks amazon,4.0,"Nice headphones ,sweet sounds... overall nice,but special thanks to amazone for fastest delivery ...now amazon becomes more active and more good, service also very nice and if you face any return refund problem they solve the issue ,so you can trust amazon,apne dukan‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Build up quality,3.0,Almost every thing is good but the build quality is not that much. I have used many boat products and the body quality was good but this time not. Not good according to the price 1500/ . It will be good price will be low.
Try some other seller/ Or avail warranty,4.0,"Don't buy this from this seller, not durable at all, the condition is really bad just after a monthEdit: Seems like I figured out late, but this product comes with 1 year manufacturer's warranty and so I got a replaced piece just yesterday and it's in great condition. It took 25 days to replace the piece since I filed the complaint, but considering the lockdown restrictions, I think they did a good work. Happy with it! Hope this turns up better than the earlier piece I got..."
Great for the price.,5.0,"Best in class for the price range. Fits perfectly. Pairing is so easy, has worked for 5+ hours for me in 1 charge. Sound quality is best for this price...can't ask for more. Build is sturdy."
Good for music,5.0,product is good as music lovers but for calling purpose not that much good. connectivity rang is not good.company saying battery backup is 6h but not more then 4h
Poor speaker. Sound is good.,3.0,Sound quality is good. Speaker is very poor. Voice is not audible. Other surrounding sound is much higher to the person on call. The person on the other end of a call stuggles to hear the voice. It's only good for listening to music not for taking calls.
The product does not delivers as per the Brand value.,3.0,"The clarity while talking is not good, if you are outside it will be very difficult to listen. The sound quality is good only while listening to music. The LED light indication is not at all visible in the daylight. It's connectivity or pairing is poor. The looks of the product is very ordinary. This product does not looks like it is for 900/- after discount. The product does not meet up to its brand value."
Just like a Rs.3 pen. Use and throw material,2.0,"It may be tempted by seeing this product, because of price and everyone around you is buying this product. I also bought the same due to the same reason. Frankly speaking, this is a good product (just like any BOAT), but the problem is it won't even last a year. I bought this on 27th August 2019, but just afer 3 months and 10 days, one of my ear buds lost audio; and it's now useless. About it's bluetooth connectivity, you can get good quality about 3-4m only not more than that."
Overpriced but best sound quality in this price,5.0,"I am surprised by negative reviews but I am extremely happy about the build quality, design and sound quality.Of course I am just using it for 1 day now. I will update again if needed. I hope I won't have to!Note: I bought it for 1999 and in 2 days the price dropped by 500. Now they are selling it for 1499. :-("
Nice quality and service...,4.0,After 8 months my headset not working and I have registered a complaint in boat website...they took it and replaced with new one... But the time taken is more than one month...may be due to corona... what ever I got new one...thank you boat.
Need to improve battery backup,4.0,"Product do not last long on a single chargeMax duration after one charge is 100 minutes.Sometime it gives you 4 hours backup.In terms of quality, yes it is a nice good quality  build product as we can expected from boat.The charging percentage decreases in multiple of 20 (eg: 100, 80 , 40,) after 40 it start beeping to indicate  to plugin the power source.In this price rage you can't get any  better  then this product."
High priced,2.0,BOULT audio quality was better than this.Quality Ok. 3/5.Not comfortable to wear 2/5.Ear pain and headache starts very early.Doesnot fit into ear properly and fell down easily 1/5Audio loud  2/5.Treble sharp and loud. 2/5.Bass 1/5 (very poor)
"Need a service from boat rockers, but not good service so we are hope less now",1.0,"I give 1 star only because there is no option for 0 star,I purchased Boat rockers from amazon, and it came with 1 year warranty, I have warranty card, amazon order number bill, and this wireless earphone is not functioning now, in just 2 month its stop working, so i want to claim my warranty card but when I drop a mail to boat rockers email id, there is no response, I call on phone number given on that warranty card, which is not a correct number, j drop msg to website, no assistance,I felt cheated.... So guys don't trust Boat rockers 255 products...."
Love it!! ‚ù§Ô∏è,5.0,"Battery life is beyond expectations, I rarely charge it and it is always in my neck listening to audible or youtube or clam app. One of the best I have used ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç"
Very Dissappointed,1.0,After one month device dead. When i visit service center he says this model is not available on service centre so You can complain through online. I complain  before 7 days but not resolved.
Boat headfone product looks good. But I'm disappointed.,2.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†All are good but connectivity is not good because it is reconnecting again and again after 10-15 mints.Otherwise all are good.So I'm returning this product."
Biggest Worst Product Ever,1.0,Biggest worst product. When songs playing then it will automatically Stop during the play. And even the forward and back buttons is not working. Now I am facing the problem is that it shows connected but sound is not coming. So i am suggesting to everyone not to buy anything from the Amazon. By showing original product it supply the duplicate product.
Very poor service and product quality,1.0,"Product stopped working within 4 months and I returned it for repair/replacement, It‚Äôs almost a that they collected the product for repair and I‚Äôm still waiting for them for any update about the product, it took almost 15 days to reach their service center and now it‚Äôs almost 15 days and it is still in their service center.... very poor service from boat.... the product didn‚Äôt even serve for 4months and the replacement or repair of the product is taking too long... Even no boat customer desk numbers work...."
Bluetooth connectivity issues...,1.0,Everything is good...but what if the earphones are not connecting to phone easily....even you can't off the Bluetooth of the headset... If u disconnected with the phone and pressed it power button once than you have to wait for it to automatically off the Bluetooth than start it again and reconnect it...Worst thing it is... If you are ok with this then buy it...
Avoid not worth.,2.0,Battery is very poor not even 2 hrs constant.Voice is always breaking.Can't be reliable for call or audio purpose.Only heavily marketed product
This boat will sink soon,1.0,Pathetic never ever ever buy boat earphones they are really pathetic and I guess the companies Head of sales department must look after the faulty pathetic earphones high on price low on performancePeople who want to buy boat don't buy it you are just wasting ur hard earned money
"Rubbish quality, didn't even connect",1.0,"Rubbish quality, didn't even connect, return period also over, now have to run behind the service center, not sure how long is going to take"
Overll at 1099 of price range u will go for it,4.0,"I bought it for Rs 1099 for this price range i thik this is good blutooth earphone.sound quality is good ,base also good but at maximum sound base is quite more than vocal ie unbalanced.Blutooth connectivity is not so good, if u put the phone in back pocket then voice getting disconnected.overall at this price range my experience is good after 2days of use.Battery backup also impressive."
Waste of Money,1.0,Sound quality is good but mic is very poor. Other person cannot hear me properly.After 4 months of usage one side stopped working. Their customer care is also poor. They say they have option to register online complain but they keep on sending me address to their service center which is like 20 km in Bangalore.
Good product at price range,3.0,Overall it is a good product. Connectivity is good. Battery life is also good as mentioned in the details of the product.Con are sound is not that great. Battery level indication is not indicated properly. Most of the time it's between 100-80% n suddenly drops to 20% and then low battery. Voice calls are good but it picks ambiance noise very loudly. At the price range it is a good product.
Didn't work long,1.0,Initiallially when it arrived it was working fine but after some time you have to charge it every 15-20 mins and when I continue using it completely stops working. Its a waste of money if you are thinking to buy something for the long term. No return policy that's very bad as unable to return as well
"Only for music, call quality is extremely poor",3.0,If you are a music fanatic then this product is surely meant for you. But you cannot expect to hear the other person when you call and vice versa. So call wise it's a waste.Only good for listening to music.
"A good choice for an year , not worthy after that",4.0,"Updated after 1 yr of usage 10.09.2020 :-It's stopped working after 4 months. I have contacted boat team they fixed (took around 15 days).Now after 1 yr the right side stopped working , unfortunately the warranty is over , so I have to stop using this.

Extremely dissatisfied. This happened just after competition of 1yr warranty which put the build quality of the boat make products unde the microscope. It seems the products are not meant to last longer.
Never buy this product!,1.0,"This is my third boat rockerz wireless bluetooth earphones and following the tradition set by Boat, this one too loses volume in one side of the earphone.

Boat Bluetooth Neckbands,3.0,"When I listen music ok not that much good and the sound is low and left side sound is working right side not working, here u given us 8hours but when we got on hands I got 6hours, I disappointed. The buds are not fitting to my ears when I put in ear playing a music its just falling down, so my mind changed."
Battery Issues,2.0,Although everything in this earphone was good till 4 months after I buy it. Now it's battery is not working properly. It's battery got discharged and now it's not charging. Whenever I connect with charger it's green light glow which indicates that it is fully charged but when I connect with my phone it says battery is discharged connect with charger.
Good could have been best,4.0,"A good Bluetooth headset from Boat, which could have been made better. Noise cancelation,connectivity is good, but sound is not that good, low frequency base is good, but other music has lesser clarity( mostly due to Bluetooth connectivity). If you have a wired headphones, please think once before buying, if you want a wireless one, then please go ahead and buy it"

Rating 3 due to poor battery backup and earbuds quality,3.0,Pros:1.Best bass quality and noise cancellation in the segment.3. Good built quality.Cons:1. Ear buds are not comfortable like boat - 100 wired earphones.2. Battery backup not so good.

A decent Bluetooth earpiece,4.0,This Bluetooth earpiece is great performing better than expectation. Battery backup is also great. Sound quality is great too. The ear buds fits well. The only problem I have is with the time it takes to turn off while holding down power button and the voice over when turning on and off.
Developed charging issues after 6months,2.0,I purchased this like eight months ago. The ear phone is just unbearable now...it starts showing blue light the after 5 minutes of charging indicating that charge is complete but it can be used to play music for only 15 to 20 minutes after charging. Neither can I charge it nor can I use it. I don't know what to do. I am checking for warranty options now don't know how much of help can I expect.
Nice Bluetooth earphones,4.0,I have been using wired earphones from Boat earlier so when I decided to get Bluetooth earphones my obvious choice was Boat. The earphones are worth the money and the sound quality is good but I still feel they are not as good as the wired ones.
Not getting what I expected returning this product.,2.0,In aug I bought boat 242 v2 and its base quality and sound quality is good. After reviewing that I bought this 255 pro I just received it after comparing both product's it's seems like 255 pro has less sound nd bass that the main reason I'm returning it.. If u looking for strong bass nd u want loud music then Don't go with this. I hope it's helpful.
Monster battery üîã backup,5.0,Pros:1.Bass thumping -10/102.vocals -9/103.treble-7.5/104.Battery -10/10( 1 single full charge - 4-5 days )5.Controls-8/106.mic -9/10Cons:1.discomfort not properly fitting in ear falling from ear2.Connectivity issues
Sound quality is good,4.0,Filling reviews after one year of use...best to buy upgraded version of same brand  which will be with more upgraded technology...It works 10 meter only ..noise cancellation is for sound quality not for mic or call quality so if expecting best mic noise cancellation then it is better option not best...
Not Worthy,1.0,This product is very very bad . This much amount is not worth because my ears started paining a lot we can't even use it for half an hr
Honest review -DONT BUY..Worst Product by Renowned Boat,1.0,"This is my 4th pair of earphones from boat and first of this model. My experience is this: either one of the earbuds stopped working or they both stopped working completely, right after warranty period was over. Boat must maintain the quality of product else this boat will take no time to sink. Already bought pair of earphones from Sony and quite happy with audio quality and durability. Bye Bye boat."
Good,4.0,I had purchased that to gift that to someone..... Overall the earphones are good.... But I had returned  that because I want to purchase the airpodes of same brand.... Sound quality is OK....
"Ear piece stopped working, It doesn't have good treble, Not for vocals",1.0,If you are a constant user then don't buy this product as it built quality is not so good within 7 months my headphone's one ear piece stopped working due to loose connection. The bass is good and the treble and highs are not so good enough it's not good for vocals. It can get pretty loud tho...! I have also experience while kept in my pocket the audio gets cut not often but sometimes but its good for calling And I also experience one problem with this that while playing PUBG the mic was not working at all that was weird i try alot of thing but it didn't activated it's mic ;-(Noise cancellation is good blue connectivity is ok but regret now after buying this headset as its one ear piece stop working!
Music lovers read this!! Before buying.,4.0,"I used it for the past 10 days.It is really good for watching movies and for phone calls. I love it for that.!It's really bad for music. Not only this all other Bluetooth earphones in this rangeI tried leaf sport 2, leaf collar 2(sounds similar to this one).jbl 110bt (hate it can't tolerate its sound quality for 10 sec).Now i am buying a wired for my music love and gaming lag in bt earphones.If movies and phone calls are ur priority go for it best in this range alternate would be leaf collar 2If music is ur love then try staying with wired ones though it seems old fashion.Honestly guys even 500 rupees wired earphones are better then bt 2k headphones. Even mi basic sounds better while listening music üé∂."
Good but poor battery functionality,2.0,Audio quality is good. Voice is clear. But the main issue is with battery.For my case battery shows 40% balance. As soon as I connect it for music battery % drop to 20% within 5 sec. And within next 45 sec device get off.
Non-functioning product,1.0,The product stopped working within 4 months they won't connect to any device I've tried multiple devices and multiple fixes. Now they're absolutely unusable. The same thing happened to my boat rockerz 510. The customer support is hot garbage. The service center never picks up the phone and there is no online RMA procedure 0/10 would never buy from boat again. Don't let the price tag or features fool you it's all gonna break down in the end.
Great product in this price range.  Wort buying ..,5.0,I m giving my review after using one month.. This is simply Awesome product..* Built quality is very good.* Clear sound and heavy bass amazing. sound quality and no sound disturb noise.* Battery life is superb more than 24hrs with use of songs and games.* Super fast connection with the mobile.Overall great product. Recommended to all who want to buy Bluetooth headset. And please ignore negative reviews because it is a very good product in this price range.
Boat Rockerz 255 wireless bluetooth headset,4.0,"BoatRockerz 255 wireless bluetooth headset has an amazing sound quality with  a great effect of bass and it perfectly fitted in my neck and the buds in my ear.But one problem is it charged up very fast but it don't give the actual 5H of playback time as it is promised. Otherwise, it is overall a good product."
Please prove boat,3.0,"Boat I believe in your potential please improve.The bass seems to come suddenly compressing the mids and highs, basically overpowering the actual song. So not enjoyable headphones despite I used equilizer to reduce bass."
Want to return the product,1.0,"I want to return this product at the earliest & shall apply for some alter alternative brandToo much echo is coming whether let be phone calls or zoom calls, or ConcallWant to return the product, I had recieved feedback from the receiver end, that he is not able to hear my voice clearly and echoing every time and the voice also not clear"
Good sweat resistant earphone,5.0,"the product came without any manual or extra buds as promised. the box was tampered. packing was not tampered. I feel it's a defective old piece sent to me by seller. its mic is not working.Update after item was replaced.Very loud and clear headphone. Even mic has very good reception.Sweatproof, good for outdoors and running."
Headset is fine. But USB charging cable is cheap and worst,3.0,"The provided in-box USB Charging cable is very worst and cheap. The cable type-C port size is bigger than standard size and could not plug it to the headphone. I unknownly used my full strength to insert and charge for the first time. I feel like it almost broke the headset port. Apart from that, the sound and bass is good. now i decided to use my phone's cable for charging."
Overall good for daily use,5.0,"I am writing this review after a months use. I purchased this product after comparing with other boat neckbands like rockerz 330, 385 etc. The sound quality is really nice and bass is excellent. Lookwise its average but its really good for daily use."
good product,4.0,"after using it for more than 5 months, the main issue i face is that battery is not sufficient for whole day of continuous use. also it works great indoors, but in train or in noisy place, noise cancellation is next to nothing."
Not good for distances above 4/5 mtrs.,3.0,"It's almost perfect for me.However, note that its not ok if you intend to use it while jogging or running. While jogging it keeps cutting off, and gives lots of noise. This was not indicated in the specifications.Moreover, if you move 4/5 mtrs away from the phone, the sound will stop. This was not mentioned in the specifications."
Replacement provided!,5.0,"The only brand which directly replaced my device for free in the warranty period. You can use it however you want, and not to worry it 1year. I have never experienced replacement with a new device will make me happier. I would suggest it to everybody. Eyesclose pick.üòäthanks boat"
Worst customer service & Don't rely on warranty,1.0,After your product start facing issue in warranty then it is worst servicer. Toll free no not working. When u fill complaint form they say invoice no is not vaild.  I will suggest every body do not purchase this product. Boat rockerz successful work only for six months. It's under warranty. But boat customer service make ur life hell if u face issue.
Replacement product,1.0,The product should not work properly...they have some technical issues so without any delay I want replacement but amazon customer service provider are refuse to accept that replacement not ready to solve my problems .it makes me more disappointed. And my product is under warranty so as a customer I kindly request you please replace my product boAt RockerZ 255.
Not worth it.,1.0,"Wrost product I ever bought. Even after replacing it during it's Wrannty period , they replace my 255pro of 1399rs with simple rockerz which was worth 999rs . Seriously is it  joke. And any product of boat is not wroth it. Plz don't waste your money on this product. There is not any option of no star rating otherwise I would not have given the star rating."
The product is absolutely Value for Money.,4.0,"I am very happy with the headphones. The product is very robust and comes in an attractive package. Bluetooth connectivity is seamless. The reception of phone calls is really good, with good audio quality. Music reproduction is excellent, with good bass. Overall I am very satisfied and its a complete VFM product for me."
Very Good!!!,5.0,"Great battery and good audio quality. I love it. This is goes with me to office, shop, market everywhere.- Good connectivity.- Good audio quality of bass and treble.- Good look- Great comfort in wearing for several hours.- Good battery."
Ok under 1k,4.0,"Battery backup for 2-3 days in normal use, sound quality is good except the bass quality. It's strong which I don't prefer usually. If you continous use it for few hours then you'll get headache n pain in ears. Built quality is good but found Little bit bulky because of its metal design. Although it's good choice in their range ~1k."
Wireless Toy!,1.0,"It grabs all unwanted external sound than our voice, there is no noise cancellation at all. I am writing this review after a very long time as observed it all. Also I doesn't connect to my computer. The only usage I do with it is to watch series. Disappointing material."
become useless after 3 months of use,1.0,"Now they have become use less for me as they can't fit in ears without ear buds supporter.(Shared current earphone photo without supporters)Product Noise, Build Quality everything is good except its round abouts (made to fit in ears) which you may lose very easily... as they get out of earphones easily when not in use(Thing is you have to take extra care while carrying or when not in use)"
Great Sound Quality,4.0,"The best part about this headphone is its sound quality, immersive and deep, way better than some of the more famous brands in this price range.However, there are no other major features in the headphone, and it is a bit clunky (not user friendly) to use and the blue tooth connection is a bit iffy.But if you just want to pay for the sound quality and not the frills, then this is an exceptionally good headphone"
Not at all satisfied with service and product,1.0,"Product function buttons are not working..service of Amazon is also not reached my expectation. Returned the product stating the issue again got the product after 3 days with same defect... They got benefited by getting the feedback from my side.. and me roaming here and there for collecting the product, returning the product and eagerly waiting for unworthy piece...if they are not allowed till the place mentioned in the address...they should tell beforehand..."
Great product by Boat,5.0,"Amazing product by Boat supeb sound quality, more than average product quality feel of the product is good has a rubbish Matt textureBut the wire length is very long and that disturbs alotConnectivity of the device is also good but hope on the newer version Boat uses Bluetooth 5.0"
Battery life ‚òπÔ∏è,1.0,"It takes about an hour or so to charge the battery to be 100% , however just about 80% and 5 minutes later the headphones is switched off. Rest all is ok but if the battery ain't good what's the point in buying this no matter what the discount. Disappointed. Plus there is on exchange only and no returns"
Value for money.,3.0,"This headphone is working in good condition and average noise cancellation is present. The sound, bass quality also average. Expected more in this product, but not worthy."
Not charging / charging problem,3.0,For me i been useing for months worked fine bt for me charging problem ocurred if u put in charge it's not getting charged red light won't come i tryed in many charges something worng in the chargeing board
üòä With the purchase. üëç,5.0,Sound quality is very good more than expected from a 1499 earbuds. After a long time enjoyed music. Bass is ultimate. Call quality is very good indoors. Didn't test it outdoors yet. I watched lots of best bluetooth devices video reviews and this one is listed in top 3. Hence considered buying it and it has turned out to be a good decision. Happy with it. Will test it more and update. Hope it will give a good battery life. 110 mah should last long
Good buy,5.0,Review after 3 months of use:Batter backup- goodSound quality- goodBass - goodI use this for ofc calls and it lasts more than 8 hours after fully charged.
Ear Bud,2.0,The big issue is ear buds  always fall.  Noise cancellation  is very low. Sound quality  is good. I have already replaced once as it had got damaged in 2months only . Big issue for me ear bud  it always fall and we won't get it extra also in market . The length of the band  could be still small so it can be stable to our neck.
"Good Product, as long as it lasts. (4 months for me)",3.0,"I bought this product in Jan 2019, and now in May 2019 one of its earpieces has stopped working. The earphones performed well while they were working. The sound quality was good, and connection with the phone remained solid throughout. Full chsrgey took around 2-3 hours and it lasted for 6-7 hours on an average.The mic is a little weak, I had to often repeat what I said as the voice wasn't clear sometimes on the other end.I used them extensively for jogs and gym and they performed admirably, never getting out of the ear midway and the coiled around the neck pretty comfortably.Just expected them to last more than just 4 months."
Nothing goes good with this prodect,1.0,"Too many errors at the same time, connectivity problem including  not connecting to my other devices,sometimes when connected to my device it only sends commands like Play pause to device and sound not coming from earphone. In terms of sound quality it's good for beat clearance but not for good base.Worse battery backup.It says 6 hrs. Average battery backup but 2 days old earphone have 4-5 hrs of backup.Giving a star only for sound quality nothing is good in this other than sound quality."
Worst experience,1.0,I bot it in 13 novNow after 7 day it is not charging I dont know what happenedWorst experience yr. Mtlab bt 1 din huye or ye charge nhi ho rha hai yrr etna time sabke paas nhi hota hai. Ab service center jana padega .Bhagwaan jane aab kya hoga

Good as expected,5.0,Sound is better than most of the other brands out there (In same price range). Bass is fine and noise cancellation is pretty good. Mic is not upto the mark as sometimes other side can't hear my voice. Overall it's a value for money deal.
Awesome version!!!!,5.0,"Nice headphones bass, sound quality is awesome like previous versions it didn't disappoint you. Battery back up is also fascinating. But the mic on right side wire is sometimes irritate. It falls while riding or while running if we not use rubber tight which is provided by them. Except this everything looks cool. Packing and delivery is also good."
This earphones are not made to listen to music.,2.0,I have apple and marshall earphones compared to those boat doesn't even come closer since i produce music i have bit knowledge about how the sound saturation should if u are a music head choose some other but i found the quality of sound is ok if u are watching movies or listening to podcast.

Boat 1k -5month max worth or not. One side earphone issue,1.0,"Guys no doubt product is good but one side of earphone is not working. I buy 2 boat earphone yet but both of them one side is not working after 4-5 month. I am paying around 1k for this product totally disappointment by boat. Better go for other products. Similar things happen with my friends also. Dnt go with review, product is good but if u spend 1k then atlist it can work 1year. Boat product life time is 6month. Very disappointment buy products."
Review everymonth,4.0,"First month :It's working well, battery backup 40+hrs with medium sound,Not suitable for Melodies.Overall rating after one month usage : 4/5 (OnePlus bass edition : 5/5)"
Overall good product.,5.0,"Overall best product by boat, but there is no any carry bag and things required so if any body assume that they are going to give you complete package then you may be wrong. They are not going to give you complete package.Note:- it disconnect several times while using it."
Headache Rockerz Bluetooth sucks,1.0,"No at all good quality i think there are two much radiation 4days used but got all 4 days lest side head ache, Previously i used sony wc200 Bluetooth it was really super i dint face any issue but this Bluetooth really not good from BoAT. I have used earlier BoAT earphones were it was very good but in Bluetooth side it's not good please don't buy anyone"
Average Performance...,3.0,"I bought this product in Aug2020.The product worked fine for me upto Dec 2020, but now its range and quality both decreased. I can't even able to listen the songs properly with my pocket distance.there might be possibility that this happen only for my unit.my suggestion-if you have more budget then go for the better one."
High charging time,2.0,"Honestly, it is an absolute disgrace when it comes to battery life and charging time. Takes 6-7 hrs to completely charge and drains within a day of non continuous, normal usage.Sound is okay. Range is abysmal. I go 12 feet apart and the connection is lost. Rather buy a wired earphone at this price."
One side earbud will not work after a couple of months,1.0,"I purchased it, and within eight months, one side earbuds stopped working. I returned it and got a new one. Now within five months, one side earbud stopped working. My warranty is over now.It's better to think of another product."
Not good for calls,2.0,"It works fine for music however when used for calls either via mobile or Skype calls via PC, the voice breaks a lot. This is not a network issue as while the call is still on if you switch from Bluetooth to phone the call works fine.. so it's definitely the Bluetooth"
Best,5.0,Backup is best when I use less it gave me upto 10 daysAnd when I used more for about 3hrs per day it gave me 7 day backup which is best in the range
Out of the world.,5.0,What an amazing Bluetooth wireless earphone. I riding my bike with 100km/h but noise cancellation is just amazing sounds clearly hear in that speed and neck band also fabulous in that speed neck band not flow in wind.

Bad Quality,1.0,The quality of product is very poor . One side earphone stoped working with in 4 to 5 month. The product was within waranty and changed but again  with in two months again one earphone stoped working.
Very good sound quality and battery is also very good,5.0,This is very good wireless earphone in this price the bass and sound quality is very goodThe best thing in the headphone is the battery back upThe battery was huge and it's almost 30 or 35 hr of battery back upOverall best headphone from boat in the market
Simple and good one. Battery life should be more,4.0,"I liked the headset for its sound and it's ok to connect via bluetooth, thus avoiding the hastles of connecting a wired earphone. Battery is getting quickly charged I think. Better to have little more battery lasting hours per charge. I didn't use it to hear music much. Used for calling, and active in Twitter spaces rarely YouTube."
GOOD PRODUCT AT AFFORDABLE PRICE. üíØ,4.0,Nice product. The neckband which I received first worked one day and then it stopped working. I requested for replacement and their response is too good. Got the replaced piece the next day of the replacement request. Good service. Must try this one. If u have a budget of 2K + then go for boat rockers 275. At this range BOAT ROCKERS 255 IS THE BEST.Thank u BOAT for such a great productüëç‚úå. üî•üíïüíØ

Defected product,1.0,Extremely disappointed . Bought this as rakhi gift for my sis in law. Product stopped working completely after just 40 days.  The nearest service center is 20km in the city they live .

Frequent Disconnection Issue,1.0,"Sound quality and battery backup looks very good.The device is getting disconnected and reconnected frequently - sometimes 2-3 times in 1 minute, sometimes after 10 minutes. Checked for 5-6 hours over YouTube , Facebook videos, Netflix, Games.Works fine while in-game. But gets disconnected while Facebook or YouTube video is in play."
Best bluetooth earphone at this price(810 after offers),3.0,Pros1.The bass is good but it loses on CLARITY...2.Light weight...convenient to use3. Battery life is adequate 5-6hrs on normal usage on 60-70% volume4. Price....at 810 after all the offers... it's the best BEST bluetooth earphone at this price.Cons1. Bluetooth connectivity is not that great....as I move from one room to another2. Quality of the sound is not that great....volume is little low... even at the highest... but if you need only bass from your phone.... then Its ok...

Too long,2.0,"Sound is not that great... Wires are too long, feels awkward to use it outside  ( other than workouts) due to long wires, especially the red one that i bought. Tried to return it but only replace option was available.  So replaced it by asking for a different color..  But again received red colored one. But after getting replacement there was a retut option.. So returning it.. Only suted for work outs.. If u wants it for professional use like in office or Clients place, don't buy this one"
"Survived not even a year... Disappointed but boAt services are really good, got replacement üòä",3.0,"Bluetooth range is very limited, stopped working within a year, m really disappointed, wasted my money.  2 extra stars for boAt services, got replacement after claiming warranty."
Good. Lightweight,3.0,"I have been using it for a year. Good product. Lightweight. If thinking to buy this now, I would suggest to look for other options as you will get much better in this price now. But if you like it and want to buy this product only, then go for it. It's good"
Fabulous,5.0,Budget killer......Sound-5/5Bass-4.8/5Battery-5/5Noice cancellation-3/5Value for money-5/5.. Normal users can use this more than one week with single charge.....ONE PROBLEM-NOT PROPERTY FITTING IN EARS ...
Please don't buy boat products its lifetime is below one year,1.0,Please don't buy boat product. you will get repair in below one year damn sure. Even if you try for warranty replacement it will takes at least 2 to 4 months approximately for replacement. customer care guys will never connect your call(if you have any doubt try to connect) and never reply to emails.Noise cancellation n Bluetooth was not up to the mark.As per my personal experience I'm suggesting you guys go for a product which have good customer support and quality products.
"Average sound quality, okay for the price",3.0,"I was hoping for great BASS which is not easily found in most low to medium budget headphones, but disappointed with it :-( Sound clarity is excellent, but output is so sharp & piercing that it could damage your hearing if you do NOT remember to reduce the volume by at least 2 points before plugging in! Over all, it is okay for the price but I already have an over-the-ear Bluetooth headset from boAt that I love and hence expected similar sound quality."
A beast earphones with dynamic abilities.,5.0,I mean what an earphone manufactured by our beloved indian company boat. The immersive sound quality with bass and passive noise cancellation is a deadly combination. A great purchase at this price point. Believe it guys it is the best earphone to buy under 2k. You will be amazed. Don't go for those oneplus and realme ones. It's a mess ü•∞ü•∞üå∑üå∑
Falls promise,2.0,Company clams if u connect both blutooth magnet it will disconnect and if u open it will connect but this is false remaining ok Product is indian so quality is little bit low but in this price like 1399 ok goodAll ok but this people should improve magnetic power on off so that power shold long lost like me travelers charging matters
Lost functionality within two months,1.0,The device has stopped proper functioning within 2 months. There is sudden disconnection of Bluetooth connectivity...Requesting Amazon to discontinue the product on quality groundsNot suggested for anyone to purchase
Big No For Long term.,2.0,"I bought two of these headphones. Both went faulty within 6months.However as they were in warranty period. Got replacement easily. Wouldn't recommend for long term.External noise cancellation is great if you are listening songs. However if you are on call, the other end person gets heavy background noise."
Don't buy this boat wireless earphone!!!!,1.0,Very worst earphone. I bought it on September 2019 and it got repaired during March 2020. Due to the lockdown I cannot repair my earphone. But it was still under warranty. I tried to contact boat customer care many times. But no response from them. I got frustated and threw the earphone into the garbage. My money is wasted and it is a very worst product. Don't buy this earphone. It is not a quality product and poor customer service from them.
Noise cancellation & battery good. Sound quality not so good.,3.0,"The sound has more of bass and very little treble effect. If you like to listen to your music with slightly higher setting of treble, you will be disappointed. Battery is very good and so is noise cancellation. It's quite big and sturdy though, will not go unnoticed."
Do not buy...go with oneplus,1.0,Totally worst product...i bought on 28 dec 2020 ..nd now 7th feb almost aftr 1month it is not working ...most of the times(9out of 10) not charging....sometimes auto disconnected ...functn buttons also not working ...
NOT THE PRODUCT TO GO FOR.,1.0,Works for only 2 months.I bought is in the end of June 2020 and last week it stopped working. Approx 1300 rs for 2 month usage is waste of money.Also when it was working very frequently it starts giving frequency noise while you are talking.Instead buy cheaper earphones 1 for 3 months. This is NOT worth the money.
"Excellent quality, despite the low price!",5.0,"Decent bass (when ear pods are properly positioned / seated, as is the case with any in-ear headphones), good bluetooth connectivity, affordable price.  Been using for about 2 months now, and all is well."
Best product for this price,5.0,If you manage to get these under 1400 they are best just buy them but if you find them for more than 1.7 or 1.8 k then you should go for Sony ones
Best in this price range,4.0,"Purchased  it in freedom sale. For the price (999), it's really  worth  it.  My sister is using it for indoor calls,  music,  movies  and online  classes. Battery  also lasts long.Pretty happy  with it."
Great,4.0,"Very nice designSound quality is also goodFits great , the plug design could be better like in the earbuds, these were a little odd shapedThe wires could have been a little shorter these hang down little too muchAnd I think the magnets are not that good."
Stopped charging after 15 days...MUCH DISAPPOINTED,3.0,"Sound quality is good but noise cancellation is very bad, so much disturbance when u r on call and MAIN FAULT is it's NOT CHARGING after 15 days. I am not able to do replace also as replace time is over..very much DISAPPOINTED. Please let me know how to replace it ASAP"
Low product life eclipses sound quality,2.0,"After 9 months of use, battery discharges instantly when taken off charge, making product unusable. Tried to register complaint, as product was within warranty period. Number does not work, website has no proper channel for accepting replacement requests. Seems it's kept deliberately that way. And mine is not an isolated case.Good sound quality and build at this price, but guess it all comes at the cost of longevity. Definitely not worth it if you are looking for earphones that last more than a year."
Value for money product if u ignore some flaws.,5.0,"Brought this earphones for 900 during amazon sale. Great value for money. Fits the budget with average sound quality, only issue is with the ear buds it starts to hurt your ears after long use. Great battery life goes on for 4-5 hours as mention by BOAT. Far better than other bluetooth earphones. Bluetooth connectivity is also good with no disconnecting isssues."
Definitely buy this product for better experience,5.0,I was exchanged this product becacuse i got duplicate product with missing items and i got this product was original boat product with all items and packing was great sound cancellation was pretty good bluetooth connectivity was up to 10m and the product is awesome
Worst no value of money,3.0,Starting it was good working but after 4 month it is loosing it's quality.First left early sounds off the after 1 month second one.No value of moneyNo service center in the town.City like lucknow to resolve the problem
40 percent good and 60 percent bad,3.0,"Hi all,Im a regular customer of Amazon and like to do shopping in Amazon all the time but this time I was little dissapointed with this product "" Boat Rickerz""Pros:Good priceBest build qualityExtreme Noise CancellationGood connectivityCons:Major con and very crusial one... Other side caller receiving all the sounds clearly except my voice. Its irritating me lot.If calling is not a major problem for you ,must buy item."
Mic is not proper and audio breaks alot,2.0,"I purchased in Sep 21, the earphone fits okays. The mic audio quality is very bad. once charged works for 2 days if not used. If using battery don't last for 3-4 hours if taking calls continuously. The audio also breaks alot while speaking. I am only using it now to listen music, not useful for taking important calls or using it while driving."
Sound quality not that great. Functionaly good,3.0,"The sound quality takes a big hit. I play have a lot that requires me to listen to audio ques, and I enjoy listening to music. Both of them were affected by the use of these. Also the ear plugs were slightly large and the rubber stiff enough to hurt my ears after continuous use"
Saste me mastüòé,4.0,"This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening music on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear."
Read reviews before buying this brand headphones.,1.0,"1.Initial 3 months product was good.2.Then experienced issues with bluetooth connectivity.3.Within 1 year, there was no sound on 1 side of the headphone.4. Customer care was pathetic. Somehow they seemed to have ensured my calls crossed 1 year warranty period."
"It's good at everything like bass,noise cancellation and sound quality!",3.0,"I would give it 3 stars!! It's been better till I saw the LED blinking for hours!! It's been blinking for two days! And I can't connect it to the mobile!I don't even know it's turned on or off.But everything is awesome,the sound quality and the mic too!! But a little bit disappointed because of this problem as I just bought it a month ago!! Think twice before buying this product!!"
Noisy if you go to a distance.,1.0,"Very bad. Once I go to a bit distance on the other room, it starts making too much noise and even after to a close position still it continues to making the sound. And hence everytime need to disconnect the call and retry again."
Budget Friendly Bluetooth Earphones,4.0,The sound quality is good and has amazing bass. Fit is comfortable and looks good too. Bluetooth connectivity is seamless and unitterupted. Battery lasts for more than 8 hours and it includes a charging cable to charge the battery. Overall it is a good budget friendly bluetooth earphones.
Excellence for Battery,5.0,Boat Rockers 255 Pro Plus. Brought just 4 days before from Amazon. Battery üîã100% worthu üî•üî•üî•. Sound also 80% above no loss. C Type charging support. Overall semma worthu.Amazon 1399
Not worth for money,3.0,"The head phones are good at the beginning, but after 10 days use started seeing some disturbance. Charging lasts maximum of 3-4 hrs. More over this is only replaceable, no return from this seller. Please make sure you select products which can be replaced"
"Great sound quality, reliable, durable",4.0,"I think its great for listening to music during your workouts and runs, i like it so much that I ordered one for my brother as well.Battery lasts long i guess 6,7 hours at a stretch.Wire quality is good.But I wish you provide an extra pair of hinges/ear loops"
Cool Product,5.0,"Don't have much range. Fit well and i have got it with discounted price and that was awesome. Having average backup as per the the product description. For a normal user like me it is superb. For extra base, back up, design go for a different one."
Not charging after 15 -20 days of use,1.0,"Bought in July 2019, hardly used for 15 -20 days. Stopped charging and when tried with a different charger charged hoti 40 percent in an hour but on usage became 20 percent with 5 min of use. After that turns super hot when I connect to charger. Total waste of money."
Worst !,1.0,"Got this free with Huawei Y9 2019, claimimg that they are 3000 INR earphones. The sound quality is worst with Huawei Y9, Zenfone 3, MI devices. Not even worth 3000 INR but works good with lenovo devices."

Good and durable,4.0,"Using for 6 months. Good battery life of 8 hrs. Sound quality is fine. Can be connected to two devices at  a time. The buttons for forward and previous tracks doesn't work properly. If you are getting it for below 1500, go for it. Overall it's good."
Value for money product,5.0,"Works well during teams meeting online, easy to connect with bluetooth..Last as long as 6 hrs after charging once.Sound quality is overall above average"
Bass lover,4.0,Very good and comfortable....bass is too good...U r bass lover... undoubtedly go to this product...otherwise music clarity and separation is not good...
#Best in this range,4.0,The built quality of earphones is goodSound is clear and the BASS is beast as expected from BOAT‚õµ but noise cancellation is not upto the mark but in this price range it is goodYou can buy it without any hesitation üòä
Left side of the speaker stopped working,1.0,I bought this in October and have been using it sparingly. now the Left side speaker is not working. submitting a warranty claim and will see what their response is. certainly would not recommend to others.
Received with missing attachments and tempered box.,1.0,I have ordered this for 3 times. Only once I have received good one. Other two times I have received with open box and missing attachments. Once I returned also and ordered new one but again I have received with tempered box.
Good,5.0,"I am using this last 10 days excellent connect/disconnect system, excellent dolby sound. Everytime feeling  like sitting in a theater. Let's see over the time. It does not connect with Macbook pro"
review after 5 months usage.,3.0,"this should have come with a disclaimer-you will never look like Jaqueline Fernandez that you find in the manual coming along with this product. What I meant is not the cosmetic beauty of hers. The wire has to be twisted before you plug into the ear or it sticks out giving you an embarassing look in the public. This I learnt after several months into buying the product. Jaqueline was lucky enough to have somebody help her with the twisting part. On other accounts,Sound Clarity - 4/5Noise cancellation - 2/5Gym compatibility(sweat, chaos) - 5/5"
"Unhappy, didn't meet expectations",3.0,"A couple of people I know have the same earphones and have absolutely no problem, but my earphones are not that great. When connected to the bluetooth, it randomly gets disconnected and sometimes it stays connected and the video keeps playing but the audio is not at all playing. Happened multiple times. Really unhappy with the performance of these earphones, I had expected a lot since I heard good reviews but never met the expectation."
Disappointed with the product,1.0,Disappointed with the Experience. The selling point for me was the battery life and the sound system which was expected to be good. But it‚Äôs really disappointing. I tried to give these away to another guy for free who returned it to me for freeAnd I can‚Äôt even return this product! I can only get replacement! The vendor is really really looking to off-load these products. PEOPLE! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS
Poor product poor service,1.0,The product quality is so bad that it gave up with in 8 months . It doesn‚Äôt turn on inspite of full charge. Cheap Chinese product sold at very high price . Warranty services are also very poor and not efficient as against the tall claims .Nobody answers the call inspite of registering the complaint. Waiting for the replacement from last 12 days. I don‚Äôt know whether it will happen or not. Have decided not to buy or recommend any more boAt products henceforth.
It's was worth for the money,5.0,I was purchased this product on 7.08.2021 and I was makes the review on11.08.2021 But until I did not charge the headphone so the battery the was good the bass is also is good and music is good to hear but the battery üîã stand is very well for me
A budget Earphone and Good enough,4.0,Bought them for 999 INRThese are good but main problem is Pain in ears after wearing them long enough to watch movie.if you just listen to music these are ok.
Good for short time use. Stopped working after 4 months.,2.0,"Works just fine if you are in same room. Bluetooth not great and sounds like robot voice if you go 10 foot away or next room from mobile phone. I order black color, received a blue one, but that's fine. Headphone worked fine just for 3-4 months. Now complete waste of money. I will try 1 year replacement warrantee. Will come back and let you know if I get a replacement as promised by seller.  Bottom line, think twice before you purchase this product."
Overall value for money,5.0,The product works as mentioned in the description.Just been using for about 2-3 hours and battery still shows 100% on my phone.Clarity of sound and bass levels are good.
+ 3rd version bass boosted,5.0,As described - launch product is as upgraded with good bass boosted as it is pro +. Sound Quality - good. Product quality - good. connectivity - Good.
Waste product only battery backup is good,1.0,The design of this product is very bad and the inear adjustment is very bad. The long band will give you irritation during the long run
"Great battery life, heavy on the ears.",3.0,"I bought it mainly for the battery life, which is amazing. Been using it for a while and it gives me over 30 hrs of playtime consistently. However, one thing I hate about it is the weight on the right ear. With the tiny ear grips they have provided, it just doesn't sit tight on the right ear. I had to use larger grips from another earphone I possess, and now its a little better."
Not good and bad quality,1.0,"Not good. The noise cancellation effect is pathetic. Doesn't fit in ear properly and causes pain. Don't go for it, look for a better product."
Great Headset With Few Cons,4.0,Sound & bass Good as Usual in a Boat Headset... Great For Bass HeadsBattery Life AwsomeRange GoodBuilt Quality GoodCons‚Ä¢Call Quality Average‚Ä¢One side Feels Heavy Due to Volume Control placed on Wire‚Ä¢ As the Headset feels little bit Big it's Uncomfortable to Wear and Sleep
Need to replace with good product,5.0,"I'm not satisfied with this product.. when compared to wired headset it is not good.. Already I replaced this item once. This is the second item, here also I'm getting noise  during call and disconnection while watching movies and not getting any alert during low battery. My friend using this same product, I have used his headset but didn't find any problems and also getting beep sounds while battery is going down.. Request you to replace with good product ASAP.."
Good for price but warranty rules worst,2.0,Only thing I dint like Is warranty doesn't cover ordinary wear and tear... So logically if you use it one weak u will have scratches on the earphones then u r not elegibke for warranty.
Defective piece received,1.0,Got defective piece. Voice during call was cracking. Buzzing noise continuously.Dont purchase if you want to use for voice call.I think seller is sending all the rejected pieces by customers.
Bluetooth connectivity Drops,3.0,"I had used Boat earlier also. Now after a year, I bought it again. The same problem continues. The Bluetooth connectivity is not good. Connection drops on the first day of usage itself. Initially, I thought some prob with my phone. But no, it's happening with other devices also. The sound quality is good but connectivity and durability should be improved."
A good deal for 999,4.0,"A review on 10 days usage. If you are buying this product under 1000 then it's a great product. Not worth if the price is more. So buy it in a sale deal. Bass is good but not great, if you are a bass lover then don't buy.  Battery back is pretty decent. Mic is ok. People on the other side get to hear you but not so loud."
Great product with good quality sound.,5.0,"Great company and good product. Bluetooth connectivity is good and very responsive. I am using it with two devices simultaneously, Laptop and mobile. Build quality is also good and have a good battery backup."
Best bass headset under 1500,5.0,"Got for RS.999 on sale. Sound quality is awesome. Best part I like other than sound is battery charges quickly, then the buttons are separate so we need not search and press like struggling with single button in realme Bluetooth. Under 1500 this boat headset is the best."
Very good,5.0,I play PUBG with it. Gives very free hand to control and no lag.Music quality is good.Can run almost 3-4 hours continuously.Cons:Sometimes difficult to connect. Multiple times needs to restart it.
"Unreliable product, stopped working after just 6 months of use",1.0,"Highly unreliable product, stopped working suddenly in just 6 months of regular use. It mentioned one year of warranty, but haven't heard from customer care even after follow up.Do go for it if you replace your earphones 2-3 times in an year."
Good sound but I am disappointed,3.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I like it's sound quality..as well as its bassBut little bit disappointed by its built quality.. it is a plastic on buttons area.. iWas already use boat rockers250 it is laminate by rubber and  I used it rough and tough. I thought some thing new in 250+ pro but it's not"
It works for only approx 18 months,3.0,"It works for only approx 18 months, after which either oneside earpiece will stop working or both, also as per service centre its not repairable, so you can see 1100 some bucks for approx 18 months .....have seen many reviews earlier with the same problem even within 13 to 15 month also"
E,3.0,One side stopped working after 7 months. Then got it replaced and it again stopped working after 6 months. I would have given 5 stars if they would have atleast worked for a year. Sound quality is amazing. They can be used for gaming also. There is no lag in audio while playing games.
best Budget earphone with Known brand....,4.0,Got for 899 during sale..... for that price its best..Can connect upto two devices.....sound and range is good....only down side is battery backup is 4-5 hrs only.... & charging time is 2hrs-2.30hrs...
Good,4.0,"Boat makes revolution in wearable brand that's why going on top for wearable brand, product was good and sales after service also really good as replacement process is faster. Recommend to buy in 999/- or less as worth the deal"
Bad quality product.It's battery is not up to the mark.,1.0,"It stopped working within 10 days of my purchase. I had followed all the guidelines based on your product video & manuals. Nothing works. Also, your customer care does not respond & replace.Amazon, please check before you keep all substandard products. I need a refund. Please do not buy this product."
HAZARDOUS FOR HEALTH - DON'T BUY IT !!,1.0,"I have received this headphone. Honest feedback - Don't buy it. Reason being - It causes headache because of the magnet used in it.  From the morning I have used it thrice, after 15-20 minutes of usage my head starts to pain and when I keep it aside my head becomes normal. I am going to consumer forum to complaint and Lodge a FIR against boat as this earphone is hazardous for health and it's quiet evident. Won't take much to prove them guilt.  Please don't buy it, for your health it's hazardous."
True Review,5.0,"I bought this i stead of 255 because of fast charging, I have Sony, JBL and Boat, Boats sound quality and bass is nice. Its fast charging is like 10 mins charge and it works 30-40 mins easily"
Worst product ever from Amazon.,1.0,In just 3 months it one side stopped working. Gave it to boat company under warranty in the month of May and till now this month September i have not received my product and they customer care service never ever responds to call nor emails. They have a system which doesn't let your call connect. Don't buy this cheap product you will be in a loss. This a third class company. Better go for something better.
Best for music and long battery,4.0,Pros-SoundDhansu batteryBassConnectivityChargingCons-Noise cancellation is not that gud(my frends complaint me about some ajeebogareeb khar khar sound in the call)Built quality is also average
Or jyada improvement ki zaroorat hai,1.0,"Product dekhne me to accha hai stylish or build quality bhi zabardast hai or bahut logon ko quality bhi acchi mili hogi,,par mujhe Jo Mila uski sound quality kattei utni acchi nahi hai, review padhke mujhe laga tha is range me ea ek bahut hi badhiya product hoga lekin chalo koi baat nahi kyunki main Amazon ke return facility se khush hoon."
Upper part is a tad bit uncomfortable,4.0,It's good but I get slightly uncomfortable because of the upper part. I guess I'll just have to get used to it. Will update this review later.
Don't waste your money on this cheap and useless company,1.0,"Don't buy this product if you're using it on daily purpose, After few months headphones automatically stop working, They will replace your product no doubt about it but it happened with me twice and they give replacement two times but there service is very poor, If call customer service center no person will pick up the call , Rarely they give response to you and i got 2 time fault in my headphones and i am regretting now , Go for another headphones this one are useless"
Poor Battery life with no service support,1.0,"The battery goofed up within 4/5 months of purchase. When contacted contacted the local authorized service centre (in Chennai) for repair under warranty,  they said their contract with Boat had ended and are not taking any warranty/ service claims for Boat Brand. Also unable to reach a centralized customer care of Boat which only shares the local (now disfunct) centre number."
Microphone can be placed under the chin,4.0,Worth for price. Good wireless headphone for mobile usage .Not sure about music.Microphone should have been on the left side of neck holder so that people on riding two wheeler can adjust it with left hand in india. Microphone can part can extended little bit so that it can be positioned under the chin to send a clear audio to other end.
"Worst earphone, waste of money",1.0,The wire torm out in 3 months. 1 ear bud was working even that also stopped now.False off from hear and neck. wire is too long. buds are not mold firmly  to  wire. Dont buy any boat product. Cheap quality
Overall good to go for,4.0,"It's actually a good earphones... At legitimate price... Bought for 999. Battery good. Sound good, Good base, Comfert good. What I diskiled is, sound cracks when phone kept in back pocket or swinging hands while walking."
Superb must buy,5.0,"Sound quality good, but my ears or small so this type of ear supporter doesn't fit my ear, other wise product is good, I want to remonded that please make a comfortable ear gripper for all type of Earbuds"
"Worst product, don't purchase.",1.0,"After using for 6 months, i faced multiple problems:1. Sometimes while running, it will stop playing in between.2. From right earphone works fine, in left earphone voice volume became too low.3. Initial 6 months it was working fine.4. Battery backup, once fully charged, it can be used 7-8 hours only."
Average,4.0,Sound is not the best when compared to other brands. Clarity is not good. When compared with the price of the product its not worth buying it. You can go for other brands with the same price.
Fabulous Neckband. ( Bass üîä Boosted),5.0,The earphones are very good and up to the mark. The sound quality is very awesome.  Bass is very Good.  The only issue that i face was its comfort. Its comfortness shall be increased.  And there should not be any issues to any one by this earphones. Awesome product by BOAT.
Bang for your bucks,4.0,"This is the top notch wireless Bluetooth earphone that I have used under 1K the sound quality is astonishing and not like anything I have used before, since I have used so many high end headphones I was surprised to see the sound reproduction and the amount of Bass I was getting from speakers. ""definitely recommend & definitely go for it if you want something like BIG-Bang for your bucks"""
Value for money product!!!,3.0,"I like the wireless headset very. Its cheap, but a good product. Build quality is good & sturdy. Bass is dominating which distort sound."
Average,2.0,"+ Decent quality, average sound, light weight and good battery life last full day mostly & charges fast.- too bassy & muddy vocals, low BL range, average mic, in-ear peice not comfy enough for long hour listening.= For 1k it is ok for commute listening and answering call."
Not with the price.,3.0,Am not much into music but the sound quality is average.And the built-up quality is so bad.But The battery on 1st time charge lasted for almost 2.5 days. I almost used headphones all day and night listening songs/ while attending phone calls/ lectures.I returned the product because of low quality of sound and cheap look.
Except battery nothing is good here,2.0,"Quality is not good at all. Feels pin in air after long use. But battery backup is good.Those who looking for a comfortable headphones , it's not for them."
Worth Money‚õ§‚õ§‚õ§‚õ§‚õ§,5.0,"The packing was nicely done by amazon but there is a need of good quatlity wraping from boat's team, it could have been more better for the customer who is spending 1500 INR.On the whole it is a good stuff and surely you will love it,one more thing is that the bass is amazing‚õ§‚õ§‚õ§‚õ§‚õ§"
"Ok for music,  0 for calling",3.0,"Ok for 900 something bucks, music is ok wired earphones in the same range definitely better. Noise cancellation during calls is horrible, the person at the other end hears ambient noise more than your voice."

Perfect go for bass lovers in cheap price,4.0,The sound quality is very good. Especially this piece is for bass lovers because it gives a massive bass boost by default. It's a perfect go for edm lovers. Just one thing about this earphones is the wire is a little long but that's not a big issue i think. But overall this piece is very good concerned to it's comfortability and sound quality. I'm satisfied with the product
Good for power cut areas. OK for outside use. Poor for sound lovers,3.0,"Only battery back up is good. Rest are not at all up to the mark. Very average sound quality. No bass. No call alert facility, no call receive and cut button. But 1 thing I must appricat that battery back up. I used it heavily in more than 3 days, still my battery remaining up to 30 %"
Faulty ear buds,1.0,"I had to gift this to my son.Very disappointing to see the quality as the right ear buds has no sound.It‚Äôs a faulty piece.

How come Saturday i got the same reply and today being a working day and monday, again the voice mail says "" we are closed today""... there is something wrong somewhere...I need a help on priority as this kind of attitude is not accepted....."

By the way  this product working Extraordinary. After 14 days review. Thank You"
Boat shows it's true colours,3.0,"I purchased this in June 2019. As expected, the headphones worked fine for a year and now the same old problem has cropped up. One of the earpieces does not work. It was working fine and I charged it. And just like that, it stopped working. I had faced a similar kind of issue with the Boat wired headset as well.But this headset worked pretty well, till it lasted.My request to Boat is to improve on their quality."
Good Earphone not Great,3.0,"The music is good.But, there is one problem the buzzing sound is coming fromm left ear bud, when music stops. It comes for 4-6 seconds and then stops. the sound is like if a CD is running in the CD-DrivePlease, tell me if that is okay?"
Potent product for purchase,5.0,Sound quality is good... One problem that I found is the band is little weaker/flexible while biking it flies with the gust of wind...Otherwise everything about it I liked very much...
Poor microphone quality,3.0,There is some problem with the mic of this headphone.... whenever i'll call someone then people tell me that i'm not audible to them. Its really very disappointing. After paying a huge sum of money i did not expected this quality of mic.
Low quality Bluetooth wireless headfon of Boat,3.0,Not very gud product...it gets disconnected from bluetooth automatically n whn its charging get exhausted thn also it shows 80% battery remaining all the time..which is very confusing..several time its pairing also disconnected at any point of time
Not good not bad,1.0,I gor first unit. I that sound was good but battery life was just 2 hours.Now i got this replaces unit and sound quality is not good as first unit. Battey is also not that good. As per my experience the difference are in units itself. Same product has different sound and battery quality .
Poor voice quality. Faulty headset less than one month of use.,1.0,"Have used boat headsets in the past they are not that bad. But this purchase didn't last for even a month.  Headset is not charging at all. Also when it was working people often complained couldn't hear me clear on phone, sound quality also seems to be bad. Chasing now to boat support to if faulty headset can be replaced. A bad purchase."
Excellent product - Good for calling and conference calls.,5.0,I was looking for bluetooth earphones for daily conference calls and MsTeam calls and use on both on mobile and laptop and this is perfect.

Good and useful,4.0,Good fit. I normally use for calls. Also used for a workout and it did not disappoint. Good sound quality and noise cancellation
"Bang for buck, but.....",4.0,"Got it at 900/- at a sale and it's a bang for the price. The Bluetooth connectivity is quite good and connects properly everytime. The range is around 10 metres and the sound distorts if you are in another room. The sound quality is okayish.. Neither too loud, nor too low. The disappointment is that the bass is flat. Don't know whether this defect is only on my device or for the entire range.  Battery backup is around 4-5 hours. But will drain your phone's battery really fast. It's a really good deal for the price, but it is not that great!Hit Like of this helped you.. Happy buying! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Worst earphones with the worst after sales service.,1.0,"The headphones keep disconnecting every 3-4 minutes. There's a problem with connection.I've charged them full, I've changed my phone, but still the problem is there.Service is the worst, I've written them a mail describing my problem and avail the warranty but no response. If anyone knows please let me know how can I return these or avail the warranty."
Good Product but without proper after sale service by authorized service center,3.0,"The BOAT Rockerz are awesome with its features but unexpectedly it stopped working within 15 days. I took it to authorized service center to get it fixed or replaced and I had a bad experience. They charged me 200 Rs. for replacement.Otherwise, the earphones are awesome. Inspite of the wire being slightly lengthy."
Amazing battery and clear sound,5.0,Amazing battery life.. good sound clarity and bass.. i was hoping for a little better background noise cancellation as advertised.. Teal color is good. One thing missing is auto call disconnect or auto pause when you click the magnets of both earphones together..this is someting which you get on oneplus is missing here.
Please solve my issue asap...,3.0,"Dear Sir/Madam,I have purchase boAt Rockerz 255 Sports Wireless Headset with Super Extra Bass dated 13 Oct 2019 but last 3 months my left side earphone not working since last 2 month i m trying to reach you but I cant Reach you .I Request you please solve problem asap.Your fast action will be appreciate for me...Dnyaneshwar Shinde7755979677/9970019564."
Overall Value for money product,3.0,Sound quality and noise cancellation is decent. Bluetooth connectivity is quick. Range is also very good.Updated review... Battery life is very less. Worked only for 2 days in full charge.
Good model but little uncomfortable to hold the earholes.,2.0,The product is good in technical aspects however while holding it in ears is little difficult. I would have asked for replacement if I didn't cut the barcode sticker on the same.ThanksAnandh
not working after 6 months,3.0,the sound quality and noise cancellation are good but right earpiece stopped working after 6 months. the product is still under warranty but unable to claim it because they have removed the product from their support site. so better buy this with less life expectancy.
One of the best wireless earphone,5.0,Go for it.......very good ear phone in low price and specially for bass lovers but it regular price is 1500rs but i bought it in 899rs in festival offer.blutooth conevtivity is very fast and sound quality was awesome and noise cancellation is average.it comes with 1 year warranty. I got replaced my old damage earphone into new one within 15 days depending on area pincode.
Good Product,4.0,It is a good earphone espacially when you exercise or run. Perfect grip on your ears. Sound quality can be improved. Noise cancellation is not that effective.

Boat:- Bass Beast,5.0,"Crystal Bass with Clear Vocal on average volume, BT 5.0 fast connect & response Better.Good deal ‚Çπ999/-Thanks - Apparao Retail - Amazon."
Awesome product.,5.0,"Boat rockerz 255 pro Bluetooth wireless headset is very good and speed charging also works really well, only issue is with charging cable which comes along with it, the cable is not good apart from that, boat bluetooth wireless headset is very good awesome product."
A famous brand with overpriced and chip built quality product but sound is good product,2.0,Pros - sound quality is good and bass toCons - overpricedBuilt quality is worstCharging slot is too tight you might broke it if you try to unplug the wireWire is hanging on your face and neck higher chances of braking wireBluetooth range is not up to the markBattery indicator will always there to full you.The real price should be 600-700
The Bluetooth headset is ok.,4.0,"The Quality of music you listen is OK. If you are looking for a cheapest and good bluetooth headset with mic for receiving calls and listening music this might be the one. The battery life is also good. Look wise is stylish, I have the red one. If you want to hear only music and need a cheaper one I will recommend go for a wired one Sennheiser CX 180. There are many others if you have money to spend ;-) ."
Excellent earphones for the price tag,4.0,"The battery life is excellent - 30mins usage almost every day has easily lasted for 1month.The ear buds somehow don't suit my ears, it keeps falling off.That's the only negative review from my side."
Good quality HP,4.0,It is good quality headphone and required some improvements in bass treble setting.. other wise one of the best neckband i found.
All good but battery guage inaccurate i believe...,4.0,Battery showing in mobile is not accurate.. drops very quickly from 60 % to 20% almost in 15-20mins and get off... otherwise everything is fine.. its product defect or all have same problem....? But overall backup is good.. just percentage showing in mobile is not accurate...
Worth for the Price,3.0,"First i have got a defected piece which was working fine for a week and then left earphone stopped working, then aftet raising this to the boAt, they have replaced it with new one. Overall the product is nice as per the price. Noise cancellation is good and the sound also. If you are planning to spend 1K on a headphones this is good option."
Doesnt. fit into ears,1.0,"Sound quality is good but the ear buds are poorly made, they don't fit into ears and frequently come out. Its irritating.Disappointed with BoAt.I would suggest not to buy."
A loose ear hook,1.0,I have lost left ear hook because of loose hook. I didn't find them to buy.  So it is difficult to handle them. Please advise.
Pros and cons,4.0,Considering the price point and the brand the product is superbly amazing. I bought it at Rs 1200 and till now I am not facing any problem except the microphone that is not that good and sometimes when I travel in a two wheeler there is a Bluetooth lag ( rarely ) . The noise cancellation pretty good but you can't wear this earphone for too long as I had faced headache after 1-2 hrs of use (depends on the individual)
Worked well for 1 year,4.0,"Perfectly worked well for exactly for 1 year later battery issues started and Now it isn't turning on but for 1 year 100% guaranteed product, i have used it very roughly so.... Satisfied"
Some noise in the background.,3.0,"There's a light hush noise in the background when the earphones are on and detecting sound. You can notice this sound for some time when the earphones are not returning any sound. Noise Cancellation is good, Bass is good, sound is good, built quality is good, comfort depends on your ear type. If you are an average user who just needs earphones, you can go for it, but it can't be your best option in any case."
Just amazing audio quality,5.0,"The audio quality is just amazing!! Powerful bass and crystal clear audio. I haven't tested the battery's capacity though....but it took me around 1 hour to bring down the battery from 100% to about 85% at 70% of volume. So it seems the battery can easily last for 5 hours. Overall, it is an amazing earphone at this price range with excellent audio quality and noise cancellation."
Product is good. You can buy it,5.0,The product was delivered in 4 days. Came nicely. No tampering or anything. Bought the Teal Green color. Not good not bad. Battery was fully charged. Nothing exciting about it. You can buy. Comfortable to wear n use. Boat music quality is same.. good. Battery life is also good. You can buy it. Neckband is a little hard but comfortable.
"it had Excellent sound, bass and voice call, not now",3.0,"it had excellent bass, excellent mids and high and Best for calling, works fine on call even when you are rinding your bike.5 star for call quality.But After 3 months right bud has started a sparking like sound."
Okay,3.0,Good product but the sound quality is average. You can make out the difference in the sound that you hear. Overall good product but would prefer a product with better sound. We should get an option to test the sound quality and then buy
Don't waste ur money,1.0,Don't buy these type of products seriously. Recently I bought this boat rockerz bluetooth headphones it had worked very nice for 1 week only afterwards a lot of disturbance while talking in a phone for that i need to replace it.

Good quality product and Worst quality after sales service...,5.0,"Everything is good about quality, but after-sales service is Worst and after 11 months of use, no audio in the right-side speaker. the company replaced the product with new ones, but it's like a dummy(cheap), bad audio quality, don't buy it."
budget friendly,3.0,"been an year since bought this, Good sound quality, mild on ears still ""A worsest ever"" when compared to normal head phones when it comes to noise cancellation. If a dog barks on even 500meters apart, my friend on phone could hear it so clear but i have to shout inorder for my frnd on call to hear my voice."
Review after 2 years,1.0,"Bought 2 of these headsets in October 2018, one was replaced thrice and the other one twice. Now both are dead.!! The sound quality and Boats warranty policy is great, but the product won't last unfortunately. Lost the money spent on it."

Good product and Worst customer sevice,1.0,"My boat Rockerz 255 initially work really well without any issue, but after 6 months one by one issue was raised.Till today also my headphones is under warranty, I tried to contact to boat Rockerz customer Team, they seems always busy or not receiving call.I sent mail also but no response it's really bad customer service I would say.Boat team  your product was great but your service is one of the worst."
Average product in it's range,3.0,"Within the range of 1k,this one is good..! But on comparing it with mivi thunderbeat,I would go for mivi.Cons :you can't carry it in your pocketIt feels something is hanging to your neckNot satisfied with the baseBluetooth range is somehow okayPros:Noise canceling is goodSound is okBattery lasting: fabulousConclusion: average product"
Durability üí©üí©üí©,1.0,"1 month - awesome2 month - left earphone stopped working3 month - right earphone stopped workingjust after that.. .refer the pics uploaded.Boat is known for it's durability. Because I have a wired boat earphone too.But this one was a worthless, hopless and junk product.But yes Bluetooth is still working absolutely fine (not the earphones)."
Value for üí∞,5.0,Using it since one yearSupport is goodMusic quality is goodBattery is goodI had bought it when it's value was 999Total value for moneyWill give it 5/5
Bluetooth coverage is very poor.,3.0,I purchased from primeday offer of 999.1. The charging point cover will break in few days.2. Noise cancellation is very poor.3. The Bluetooth coverage is max 10feet and after that signal lost.4. Will connect to single device at a time. Boat's claims is false for 2 device.5. Sound quality is very good for watching movie.6. The device worth in between 500 to 700 range rather 1200 or 1500 rupees.
Worst battery life,1.0,I ve used many bluetooth headsets. I ve never seen such a headset with worst battery life. Battery becomes 20 % just after 4 hrs of usage. Charging twice a day
Please buy if you want budget headsets.,5.0,"Amazing Product. I never thought I could trust electronics products online but here I am standing corrected. These headsets are really durable, comfortable and exactly what I needed. They fix up good in your ears and thus can be used while running or workout. The battery capacity is unbelievably great."
Disappointed,1.0,I was eager to experience the sound. But the product itself didn't turn ON. Its been 12 days i raised my defective complaint. But no response from technical team yet. Not even charging up. It was total upset. Model name BS1500
Boat product is just fake,3.0,Do not buy as it has defect issue it's right earphones stop working it's waste of money it stopped working right after 6 months of use it was still under warranty so I did ask for service of the earphones to boat service center they simply ignore your complaints. Even though u are still under warranty boat company refuse to provide service to you
Product is ok,3.0,"I ordered this product on lightening deal. I got at 999.  Product is good but used low quality plastic used in neckband after used 2 days left side wire loose from neckband attachment.  Left this afterall product is good.*Sound clear, Bass also deep.*Bluetooth connectivity range disturb after  2 meter distance.*Battery is good. After 10 mins charging u can use for 1 hrs."
Worth for money !,4.0,"prosBattery last for two days on a single chargebass quality is suberpnice experience while we play songs in youtube, or any other appconscan't receive voice clearly during a call.noise cancellation doesn't works well"
Can buy without a doubt,4.0,"Worth for a 1000rs far better than Boult and noiseBattery will come for 1 day for regular users ,sound quality is good but not excellent , causing pain after wearing helmet for 20 minutes but it's the same in all headsets"
Overall good product...Value for Money!,4.0,"Nice product value for money. Noise cancellation isn't that great, but considering the price, it's okay. Music quality and connectivity to phone is good. Overall nice product. Recommended if you are looking at something in this price range."
Boat earphones are always Best.üòÉ,5.0,I Got this in ‚Çπ1399/- Soud experience was awesome Bass is Best. considering this price segment it is Best value for money 40Hrs music play back. thank you boat ‚õµ Thanks Amazon ü•∞
Great earphones!,4.0,"The sound quality is fine, the bass is also okay. They are very light, so if you use them while running or working out you don't even feel them. The battery life is also good. Most importantly if you work out or run then you don't have to constantly worry about the wire being pulled. So for ‚Çπ999 these are a good catch."
Worst ever product i bought from AMAZON,1.0,Worst BT Earphone in 1.6K range. After 3-4 months it started Bluetooth connectivity issues. During 4th month left side earphone stopped working. It was understandable that sometimes electronics malfunction so i raised service request to boat service desk and they asked to ship back the earphone for repair. Now its been almost 3 weeks with no feedback nothing and no reply on mail. Customer care number is used to fool customers as no one will reply even if you are on HOLD for 30mins.
After 6 months of usage,5.0,"1st month it was excellentNo issues with batteryBut after two months battery last only for 1hourIt was under warranty so I given to boat for repairingIt has taken 4 days to repair , now again it has given excellent performance in battery. But after two week its power button isn't workingWithin 6months I have given to repair for 2 times"

not functioning within 10 days,1.0,this product stopped functioning within 10 days of purchase.I had activated the warranty as per their instructions. but my complaint is going in circles as no one takes proper responsibility but  asking me to contact this site or that site etc without any outcome so beware ! rather poor after sales service
Worst after sale service,1.0,"The main reason for this negative review is their after sale service. After few months of use, one of the side stopped working. I registered a compalin on their portal anf got the ticket number also. It has already passed more than 3 months when I filed the complain, but haven't got any response from the boat support. I ttied calling their customer care multiple time, but no one receives the call. Very bad after sale service."
Good earphones for bass lovers.,4.0,"Good headphones for base lovers, though the mids and lows could have been better.After around 10 month had issue with Bluetooth range and one side earphone stoped working. Under warranty got it replace but the replace process was very slow taking about 22 days."
Good product,4.0,"It is comfortable and provide good quality voice and has good range voice catcher, it is as I aspected but one ear earphone is a little loose so it got off after use of 30-40 minutes."
Duplicate product delivered,1.0,The worst product I have received from Amazon  earphone battery backup is totally zero battery backup is not more than 3 hours. Totally loss of money I think Amazon delivered duplicate product in the name of  boAt. Team boAt please connect to me on this bcz  after a month the experience is very bad by using this low quality earphone.

"Best earphone of range as it says ""U HV PLUGGED INTO NIRVANA""",5.0,"Bass was almost good, atleast way better then wireless earphones of same range. Design is good magnet provided realy makes it feel great. Sound quality is good, clear sound, mic works perfect, no problem faced, amazed that it could actually connect with my phone and lappy together and swithched to phone auto when there was a call, battery life is pretty awesome, got almost 8-9 with first use, problem was that nither my oneplus 6t nor my lappy could show the ryt battery level. Got at 1400 so a pretty awesome deal."
Good enough,4.0,"The bass booms, its good for casual listening.The bluetooth disconnects every 30 minutes-ish when you're on call. But that could be a problem with my phone.Overall, I'm happy with this product."
Don't wait....Just buy it......,5.0,I am writing this review after one week.Trust me it's worthy to buy coz1.Nice sound Quality2.Crisp and clear sound with proper bass3.Most imp it's battery Life.(It's been week now and I have charged only once)So if you want good quality sound with long Lasting battery then this is the best option
boAt Rokerz 255 sports,4.0,"This was my first Bluetooth earphones and mark my words my experience with these were awsome .the built design is so comfortable which give you a very good feel, and talking about the battery backup it's so amazing as compared to other brands ,the design of earbuds are soo good which fits perfectly in ears and u can be assured of its fitting it will not fall even if you went running with it, and the  Bluetooth gets connet to mobile or any other device very easily."

Nice and value for money,5.0,"Good noise cancellation, very good sound. Good battery life. WOrth it, a mjst to have.However, it cannot connect to multiple devices (e.g. ipad and iphone ) simultaneously like plantronics."
"All Buttons stopped working by 12th day, unable to turn off; PATHETIC !!!",1.0,"On the 12th day of usage, 5 days after Amazon's return window closed, the product became unusable. All Buttons stopped working, and I am now unable to turn off. Volume Up/Down, On/Off; nothing is working. Right now, just waiting for the battery to run out, not sure what else to do."
Don't go for it!,3.0,"Product is good with its purpose but I'm very disappointed with its functioning. My left earphone has stopped working within 6 months. I'm trying to get it replaced and no one is there to receive my call on the other side, wow! I paid 1400 for this service!Same case was with my friend's earphone. One side of it isn't working and no one is there to replace it despite the product is in the warranty.Majorly disappointed with Boat!"
Can't be use regularly.!,4.0,"Best earphones for high sound and high bass lovers but not so comfortable for whom they like peaceful sound.Even, not good for ears sometimes it causes headache due to high sound even at minimum volume.Otherwise battery backup is good about 6-7 hours continuously by 50 minutes charging approx"
Best in class product,5.0,"The bass and treble is well balanced and is very good in comfort using since 1 yr no problem faced yet but the little problem is that battery is not much long lasting it may last 3_5 hrs barely , and voice clearity is awesome and the band has soft touch must use product"
"Replaced the headset twice within just 2 months of purchase, pathetic quality",1.0,"I need to replace this headset twice. Quality is very bad and each time I have to wait for 15-20 days for a replacement, boat doesn't have any service center and you can't even speak to a customer care. Better not to opt for boat."
It worked for 3 months and it started giving problem,2.0,"One can use it for not more than 6 months, it is kept in a drawer for the last 6 months coz it has stopped working. I thought of replacing it but always forget to do so. Today I saw it in the drawer and got to know it can't be replaced. one has to use it very carefuly."
Purchase this product in offers. bass lovers product.,4.0,If you want to keep it most of time (like 5-6 hours continuously ) in your ear then ear pain will occur . But I am satisfied with this product . Bass quality is so impressive and sound quality is too good. But noise cancellation is poor. Battery backup is like 9-10 hours . I suggest that it should be purchased only in offers period.
Perfect Product to use,5.0,1.Connectivity and Comfortably both are great. It is to maintain and light weight. It is easy to keep with us whole day and no chance to lost it. After 5 months of use I realized that it is one of the best Product for my ears.2.The battery life is awesome. I used to Charge every 3 days. Sound quality is very good of this product. no headache after using continuously 3 hours for meeting or lectures.
"Good ,but Replacement takes time",3.0,"Product received did not work after 2-3 days of usage, the earphones weren't starting even after charging, the charging light wasn't glowing as well. So Now sent a replacement request and its probably replacement date is ""5Nov to 1 December"" which is Shocking."
"Was disappointed at first few days, but now more than happy now",5.0,"writing after using it for more than 4 months.At first lil disappointed due toh connectivity issue, many times it gets disturbance I believe could be bcos of frequency overlapping. But I want to talk about today's experience I am traveling for around 8 hrs now its incredibly working awsm, no battery issues, no connectivity issues, still 60% battery remains. I think its bcos of short distance range.Earlier I used to take it everywhere hung up on my neck and it everytimes it took time to reconnect. So all in all happy with it now."
"average sound, battery drains quickly, stop functioning after shorter duration.",1.0,"nothing so great about the headset, too pricey based on the performance of this product. proce should be around 500 for this kind of quality, should have bought other less known brand than this. start giving me sign of poor battery and sound quality just after my return window was closed.Edit - not only battery issue after usage of mere 6 months both side speakers stop working only working when twisting and trying to bend the cable , cheapest quality of bluetooth i have ever had. not recommending to anyone."
Best Buy under this price! Won't Be disappointed!,5.0,Love love loved the headphones... Best buy under the price range! Super strong and compatible... Great Bluetooth range... Gets a bit messed up around metals like iron.. very happy with the quality and fit.. gifted one to my sister as well aftr using it myself for around 6 months! Thumbs up !
Poor connectivity during call.,2.0,"Poor connectivity, even distance is less than 2ft. Voice break in call and sometimes in music. Tridled with few different phones to make sure no compatibility issue, but all time connectivity issue. For this high price, not upto mark. Box packing was used. Seems like supplier keep rotating faulty used item."
Doesn't fit in the ears,3.0,The noice cancellation of this earphone is above all the earphones in this rangeBut for me it was not usefulWell..even after it comes with ear support..it doesn't fit my ear..comes out of the year as i make some movement..Thus not meant for me..
Insane value for money,4.0,I have used a couple of budget wireless earphones in my life and this is by far the best one. The sound quality is just too good for the price. Noise cancellation is just average. The sound stage is definitely on the base heavy side but not too basey. There isn't much loss in sound quality when increasing the volume. On the whole this is a really good earphone and a amazing deal. I recommend this to anyone trying to but their first pair of wireless earphones.
Battery backup kaa baap,5.0,Allover great product with great bass & sound quality. It has a massive battery backup around 35-40 hours at 50% - 60% volume level. Using for last 4 days continuously approximately 10 hours a day and 20% battery is left.
Good to Go...,5.0,"Amazing product and the sound quality is the best. Talking about it's Mic, then if you are on a call, it becomes too noisy for a person who have called you. I disconnect it when I have to attend calls because noice cancellation is not that good. Overall the product is great and Bluetooth connectivity is great. Gets connected quickly."
Not as per the expectations,2.0,"Look and feel is not well of this one,  cords are very thin if less careful then can be damaged also finishing is not good seems like material used is low grade. Looks older in visuals of the neck band. Overall not a good one. More over only replacement options available instead off return and finding another good one"
Stop working after 20 days.,2.0,"Bought the product on 27th July. Worked fine till 16th August. Its not working , charging or getting its power on anymore. Did not drop it anywhere or touched with water . Cant return the product as return window is closed and now 900 rupees is a waste. Disappointed . The warranty card said it had warranty for 1 year."
Disappointed,2.0,It's working great at start but using it for 1 year this isn't working at all...it seems like it doesn't worth the penny... If I had spend money then I would have expected it to work as long as possible but it isn't.
Worst product and seller both,1.0,"The magnetic function was not working and then i did the replacement again the product which i got it is same the magnetic function is not working and the sound guality is also not good the cost is very high and one more thing the return facility is not there so be aware, first time i got cheated by amazon product. Worst experience."

don't buy it,2.0,don't buy this product.it has a blue light blinking problem. the light blink after every 2 second after paired.it is very disturbing at night time. I buy it for 1400 rupees but in great indian festival it cost 900 rupees.
Sound quality is very bad,1.0,Sounds qaulity not so good...and sounds cuts frequently...worst product I used from amazon....and it automatically connected or disconnected
Stopped Working in 3 Months,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†The product stopped working in just 3 months without any physical damage. It turned off automatically and even recharging is not taking place.The phone number for the warrenty claim is not functioning too, its invalid number.My email is being replied omly by computer generated mails and my complaint registration was not acknowledged"
"Nice sound, good bass",5.0,Very good sound quality. Bass is good. Battery backup is awesome at this price range. Wire is little long. Overall very good in the price range of one thousand.
"Calling has become an issue, nobody can hear a word I say",1.0,"For music it's ok, but when it comes to calling, this product is beyond disappointing.My caller's are not able to hear my voice(though I can still hear them).Battery life is ok.But my purpose to buy a wireless bluetooth hasn't been fulfilled.So overall ---- üëé"
Boat Rockerz-Detailed Review,3.0,"Connectivity- Disrupted many a times even if ur phone is in ur pocket and then the music starts laggingSound - If your connection is not affected, it has a very good soundMic- Okay for silent enviornments. But dare you not to use it in noisy enviornment or you'll be damnedLooks- It's sleek nd light weight and looks cool and stylish at this priceFinaly you can definitely go for it if you can get a deal under 1000rs."
The ear holder near ear bud is falling often,4.0,"The device is so good, it works perfectly and the charge last for around 10 days for me with the usage of 6+ hours per day.The worst thing I dislike in the product is the ear holder near the ear bud is falling easily, if we are careless we might lose it while we go out. Apart from that it is well and good."
manually setup while incoming,3.0,"when we call some one so bluetooth is stable connected but whenever we recevd call from another person the connectivity is auto setup over phone bluetooth is disable automaticlly, so we had to setup manually fucntion.  not good for bikers, and car drivers."
Important Review Information,5.0,Good Wireless Earphones but if you buy for playing games like pubg mobile pls don't buy any wireless earphones go to wired earphones they gives you better experience. The sound quality is excellent and noise cancellation is working properly on crowded places. Noise cancellation is work only when the phone is near. Bluetooth connectivity is excellent. Go for it it's worthy..
Wonderful.. Don't think just buy it,5.0,"Best sound quality, noise cancelation and looks.. Just amazing and superb.. Must buy.. üëå Worth the price.."
Worth every penny.,5.0,"Unparalleled sound quality at this price range when compared to any other brand.Great accessory for tour and travel.Easy to connect, control and carry. Got this at ‚Çπ999 on discounted days. Battery backup also great."
Battery life is frustrating,1.0,Earphones shutdown with 20% battery remaining.They claim 40hrs life but in reality its more like just 8-10 hrs.Why you display wrong percentage of battery charging??One moment its 40% next couple of minutes its becomes 25% and then it shuts down within minutes saying battery low!!
Stay away from this product,1.0,"Worst product I have ever bought on Amazon. Very surprised to see this tagged as ""Amazon's Choice"" - lost confidence on the method used by Amazon to recommed a product.The product is so bass heavy that the actual sound is lost. If you love quality of sound just stay away from this product."
Budget friendly with sound quality upto mark,5.0,First of all its a boat product therefore sound quality is top notch then coming to design it is cool as well as tough guy with flexibilty at its highest levelBut after few months of use ear fits may become lose or i think i havent cleaned my year for long
Should go for it,5.0,The products was upto my expectations it did well in all terms the battery life was also good but the only thing was the charging time it was so frustrating to charge it till 100 after all when the battery goes under 50 the charge runs out very quickly but overall the products is very good I got more than 6hrs of battery life everytime I charged upto 100 in simple words around 9 to 10 hrs
Value for money,4.0,pros- good clear music-using it for one year. so its reliable-after one year still battery backup is good- looks stylish-no connection issuescons- doesnt feel the bass that great.okay for the money it demands.
Doesn't work after six months; Replaced with New one and now completed 2 years...,5.0,I bought this 6 months back... An above average quality... But doesn't work one of the earphone  now I would like to claim the warranty...replaced with New one now used for 2 years after that getting good experience... Couldn't find any problem to replace or for new purchase... STILL WORKING WONDERFUL
Complaint raised on the issue not responding..,3.0,I bought this product . In 3 months time one side of the ear piece is not working..they told there is a warranty for that either it will be repaired or it will be changed... I have raised a request one week back till now no one came to take the product from me.. when I called customer care of Boss services they kept my call in hold and after 15 min they told that they get back to me ...till now no one called ... I think all these warranty story are just for sake...they are not really cared for solving the issue ..
"Performance is not good, I'm dissatisfied with this boat earphone",1.0,"My earphone is not not working properly, sound quality is not clear some time it not connected with my phone bluetooth device and on phone call micro phone not working properly so that in voice is not listed other person on call, it's not working  good , as per prise earphone performance is not so good. I want to my refund back or replace me with new one. I'm not satified with your product , its west of my money...."
Worst Battery life!,5.0,Doesnt even last a year. In 7 months my left side stopped working and i have to replace it. Then after 6 months of replaced earphone the battery started deminishing very soon. I couldnt even speak for 15 mins and the earphones would switch off because of the battery running out.
Review,3.0,Pros:- fast and easy connectivity- sound quality is good- bass is goodVery good product if you want to just listen tousic or movies..Cons:- Pathetic noise cancellation. Even the slightest nearby sound is AMPLIFIED- Battery life is very very poor- Charging time high.Worst product if uiu want to use it for calls.
"Must buy for a Bass lover, That too pocket friendly.",4.0,"Nice earphone with super bass, good build quality with rich music experience. Thanks Amazon for quick delivery and amazing product. Will definitely recommend it."
Swollen Battery,3.0,"The product is quality is good. Sound is great. I found battery life to be too less. It had me recharge my headphones every 3 hours.In less than a year, the battery is swollen.It's a HDV 400480 110mAh 3.7V battery.Ensure that products have quality battery life."
Not reliable,1.0,"The headphones feel fragile and won't fit around the neck properly. The headphones stopped working after 2 months, it doesn't charge. It's dead. I was using JBL wireless headphones, it's been almost a year it works like a charm."
"Ok if u dont like crisp , frequency separation for music",3.0,I ve used many earphones. Best fit oppo enco m31. But boat is good with buttons and usability than oppo. Bass is good. Frequency separation is not that gr8 which is good in philips.
These boat rockerz are average. Don't expect much from them.,3.0,"Hey guys,Boat rockerz 255. I expected much from it. Sound is okay I think. It's loud bass is clear but the welcome sound and all those things are very average. Overall experience is not that great as it should be. You'll feel like you are using some local product. If you have experienced some good earphones or headphones earlier. You'll not like them for sure.Thank you"
Great product üí•üí•üí•,5.0,"Its been 14 days since I bought this product. To be honest this is the best headphones I have used so far. I'm really really satisfied with the product. There is good noise cancelation, bass and a great sound experience. And it has built-in volume control. It is just the perfect headphones and I have no fear recommending this product."
Good Product With Short Lifespan,3.0,"The product was really good no doubt it just getting out of order very soon. After the use of one month, it starts causing fluctuation in sound and making an unusual noise while playing sound."
Terrible quality,1.0,The sound quality is acceptable from such a cheap pair but there is no proper noise cancellation. But the worst part is that the left earpiece has completely stopped working within 3 months!!Theres 1 year warranty but no one responded to my request.Dont waste money on it.
Bass Lover,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†The Product is Amazing. Before this one I had Boat Bassheads 225 which also were amazing. I had a great experience with boat so I ordered these and It has great crisp sound and great bass. If you do love bass this product is for you. Don't buy any other brand. Just go with it.Just one issue is there that it has got really long wire which would get messy sometimes."
Got dead in 15 days only.never buy this product. Waisted money.if possible return your product..,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Box is very small for reviewing this product.it got dead only in 15 days.my money is wasted. Charging stopped. No use of buying. Please avoid this product...one star review is very much for this product..The boat got shrink.üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°"
Manufacturing fault,1.0,"Don't Buy this productContinues disconnect and reconnect with my redmi note 8 mobile phone,I am returning 4 time to boat support and all time they return me same pis with same defect. Non reliable product and person also........"
Don't buy for long time use. Great battery and charging speed.,3.0,"Truthfully, it's a great product. But cannot be used for longer hours, sort of pains in ears. Ear piece is not comfortable. I am using wired boAt earphones which have different sizes of ear pieces and that helps.I would recommend boAt over-ear headphones for regular usage."
"Works Good, Value for money",5.0,"I got it for 899rs Definitely value for money, it has very good bass and crisp sound quality not too loud. It comes with fully charged. I've been using it for 7hours till now the battery indicates 100%. I don't know it is glitch or some error. If you are bass lover just go for it. It has very high bass."
Product is good,4.0,Boat's ear phone are awesome ......Superb sound quality. Great bassIt is of neckband design & comfortable to wear.  And in just half an hour it gets charged .Gift to my daughter.....and she is very happy .But the packaging was bad . Old packing and was also torn. Not of Amazon standard .Dealer should be made aware of it...
Good but with one and only problem along,5.0,"The Headset is so good to hear the songs and videos , you don't have a feel latency in this headset , but there is only one problem with this headset noise cancellation while speaking phone calls failed to cancel the environment noises than your voice so receiver didn't hear your voices than the environment noises"
Not worth of 1500/- battery always discharged.,1.0,I will not work after 4 months of continuous use. Battery always discharged. You use it once and battery all over. Bought it if 1500/- what a cheat.
Worst headset,1.0,If your money is precious to you then never ever buy this earphone for god's sake.Sound quality is very poor and battery performance is worst and whenever I m listen to music or watching video it is buffering and the voice is cutting down on repeated basis.My honest review to this is not to buy ever
Voice not clear due to huge bass...,3.0,"For those who like only the bass but not sound quality, i recommend this product. Due to huge bass, the vocal and other sounds are not much audible. The price is very low compared to other similar items... Bluetooth range is more than expected, i got more than 10 meters. Note that 40 hours playtime is available only at 50% volume."
Good,4.0,I have been using it for 5 months now its a very good headphone. For gamers as well as casual users. But after this much of time i feel a lil bit of low volume at max vol
Boat rokerz 255 review,3.0,"I really not satisfied by this product in this price segment we see a lot of options with some extra good features, I can say that sound is just OK not a good as I was expected and bass is not so good below average and there is no passive noice cancellation . I recommend that go for boat 330 and 255 pro and pro plus"
Not suitable for calling. Only for music.,3.0,"For calling sometimes there is no sound of caller, but when disconnect the Bluetooth then I can hear the caller on phone. So pathetic. This is only for music not for calling."
Budget Friendly,3.0,"Not so great sound quality. Poor sound clarity, bass is okay, loudness is good.If you can afford more, then this one is not recommended. Check if you can afford sennheiser brand."
Battery issue,1.0,"I bought a second pair of these after using the 1st pair for 6 months, before it conked off... Now the second one is also damaged. Works when plugged in so I am guessing there is a battery issue. Very sensitive ... If you keep it plugged in for more than 5 min after full charge, the battery gets damaged... Very disappointed"
Got damaged and stop working after 1 month,1.0,I ordered the product on June and the product stopped working in 1 month. That's a very bad product quality.I advise all of you to never buy headsets from online
"Comfy, entry level piece",4.0,"Comfortable to wear and extremely simple to set up. Got a funky feel to the brand. I feel the sound has a higher bass tone, which can‚Äôt be adjusted. Battery life while on calls should be better. That said, this set is really growing on me and worth the price (1.8k)"
"Completely worthless , pathetic product",1.0,Worst product used as of now.Bluetooth acts weirdly while put in pocket.Unable to hear while call/reset requires every hour if used more.Videos got mute after call.And most importantly warranty is miserable.Got a faulty replaced product after month of tracking and mailing.
worst customer service,1.0,"I gave them one star because after 2-3 month ,one side ear piece stop working. I returned it as it was in warranty claim but they never returned me back. I called customer care not less than 50 time's but they never responded .Highly disappointed the way they treat their customers."
Go for it if you want a basic wireless ear phone.,3.0,Basic wireless headset with mic. Sound quality is average. Had expected good bass as its from boat.. but was disappointed with the bass as well as the sound quality which sounded artificial. Batter backup is good and also the make quality is good.  A 3 star product.
Not a good product,5.0,Best part it charges in 40 mins but stays up to 6 hrs. Noise cancellation is average. After using for 5 months it gets struck in the middle when listening to music. And charging is the same. There is much difference in the sound which is bad  and gets reduced. I don't recommend this product even its price is low.
Stopped working after 3 months,1.0,"This product stopped working. But when I put it on charging it is working fine, seems issue with the battery . I purchased it by seeing the review but now i regret buying it. I have sony earphones which is working perfectly even after 2.5 years. I will Never use boat again"
Very happy;-),5.0,"Very good fit & finish. Excellent base. Multiple Bluetooth devices pair simultaneously. Best value for your money.I know it‚Äôs too much to ask for the price but if wireless charging was also included, this device would be the best of the best."
Great sound. Using these for about 2 years now still in good condition.,4.0,Great sound. Using these for about 2 years now still in good condition. No problems whatsoever. Sometimes have to pair It manually. Even all this time later I still get about 6 to 7 hours of battery backup. Can easily get away with it on a single charge for a whole day.
Bahut hi ghatiya quality h,1.0,"Bahot hi ghatiya quality h .3 sep 2021 ko buy kiya tha replacement policy 10 sep 2021 ko khatam ho gai, 11 sep ko ek tarf se sound aana band ho gya.Boat ki tarf se 1 year garantee ko claim kiya to 1 cheap quality ka use kiya hua bluetooth earfone bheja gya..Mene negative comments ko najarandaj krke galti kr di.."
It's  not worth guys instead of this go for rockerz335,3.0,"It's not that good ...spend 200rs. More n go for rockerz 335  ...It's very heavy by weight...It's sound quality is fine actually It's quite good if compared to others spcly for bass loversBattery backup is quite amazing*As all of us know boat is not changing the ear tips ,they are ridiculous*"
A value for Money product,5.0,Product is very good and worth for money.Sound quality is very good.Bettery is also fine.Build quality is great.I would like to say thanks to amazone for fastest delivery.But the product packing seal was opened.. Seller service is not up to marks.
Good battery backup and sound,5.0,Good sound battery backup very goodBut it's not connect two mobile devices I think it's connect one mobile and one other device like laptop
Wastage of Money,1.0,"I have bought 2 headphones. Both became defunct within 3 months. Boat gave replaced one within warranty period. However, it also failed within 2-3 months . Failure is power failure. It doesn't charge.Regarding other, boat didn't respond to complain. My advice, not to waste your valuable money in this product."
Don't recommend during this pandemic,5.0,"My earphone stopped working after 6 months. I registered complaint with boat support. They took the earphone and didn't send the replacement items. I tried to contact them through mail but they are not responding. I sent more than 15 mails as reminder. But, my bad. I tried to contact them through call, but they never lift the call.During this pandemic, don't go for boat.Worst customer care services I ever seen.Thanks!"
Look for something better,1.0,"Sound quality is very bad and signal reception is very low. If I keep my phone in my trousers pocket while wearing headset, it usually doesn't work. I have to keep mobile in hand to listen to a song without frequent hiccups. The performance is worst during calls, i dont understand the problem but i receive weird disturbance while someone is speaking at other end. Its very frustrating to switch back to earpiece mode and listen again"
Worst battery life,1.0,Awful product. Battery sucks big time. Worked only few days. Even charging for couple of hours. Battery stay for 5 min. Pathetic. Sound quality is good.
Not as expected,1.0,Bluetooth connectivity is stuck always when connecting to mobile. While playing view music always stuck when using the earphone. Multi connect is stuck not connecting immediately after Bluetooth is turned on.Music stuck when notification coming in mobile.Bad experience with this headphones.
Do not but boat products,1.0,After using 4 month writing review ear phones are not connecting through Bluetooth and  it is not on the blue light on ear phones. Boat company can't providing good quality products. I faced with issue of boat headset also. I gave cc support they return new product after 2 months. Boat service also worst. Please don't go for boat
boat rockerz doesn't rock,1.0,"I WAS ALREADY USING boat rockerz 255 before buying this item, but its not of that quality, it doesn't say boat rockerz 255 after pairing, sound is to loud like an ordinary earphone, no voice cancellation feature in place, moreover what is hands free mic I did not receive it, I was looking for surround sound as described in your 'MORE DETAILS' it's disappointing to say the list"
Good but not best.,3.0,If I will talk about its build quality than it is bad. They got damaged in just 6 months. Sound quality is really nice.Good bass and I was able to listen backgroud other instruments.Bluetooth range is not so good.Call quality is not good. I had to speak little loud so that person on other side could hear me.
Only Return,1.0,"Same issue I am facing again after replacment..why the battery backup is too poor , if I compare with local U&I product the battery backup was really nice but with this device not feeling good even the noice cancellation also not working properly.. don't like these things with good name .  ..as it's not good want to return this product kindly suggest me with good one.Thanks"
"Awesome product, highly recommended.",5.0,"mainly I'm really impressed with the built quality and sound, just wow. I have experienced, good but awesome bass and sound delivery."
"If you are a bass lover, this is not recommended",3.0,"Based upon reviews purchased this headset during the sale for 1K. The question is ""Did it live up to my expectations? I would rather say no. Previously I've been using Samsung very old first model headset, where sound quality would be clear but would have a low base. That's the reason why it lasted long. But this one (boat) has a pretty good noise cancellation, decent bass but not like mentioned by majority of reviews. And 1 major issue is while driving, connection goes off turns on at times which is quite irritating."
Money waste poor quality,3.0,Dont waste your money in this I bought it in RS 899 but I suggest you to go for jbl infinity in rs799 plz don't buy it totally waste of money and worst soundüò™üòí
Best buy,5.0,"Wow!these Bluetooth earphones are just best in price, sound, Desgin and everything...just close your eyes and buy it‚ù§Ô∏èthe sound quality of these earphones are damn high you will be blown with it ..."
Suddenly stops working,3.0,"The problem is that after use for 2 days on charging it shows 100% and 80% always. The point is that it doesn't shows 20% charge even it is so, on its place it shows 80% . This was the main problem. Another problem was that while on a workout suddenly the earphones stopped working even though it had battery.also one side of earphone was not working when I ordered it for second time"
First tym using wireless earphone,4.0,Sound quality s gud. I bought tis mainly to talk and it meet my expectations. Super bass and  loved to hear songs in it.Bluetooth connectivity s super its easy to connect with voice notification and also with gud signal i can talk in hall with my mob in room.Noise cancellation s not available in it.Only drawback i felt as it is small earbud it doesnt fit my ears well i have adjust it often as it falls other than tat i like tis boat rockerzz earphone much.
Best budget Bluetooth headset.,5.0,"Sound quality is okayish but best for price range.Noise cancellation is good.Causes pain in ear after long use of more than 3-4 hours. So not that comfortable.Good for listening music while workout, fits tightly in the ear.Bass is good but treble, mids and low's of the music are muffled.Battery life proves to be of 4-6 hours.. and 2-3 hours during call."
Not worth the price.,2.0,"I purchased this headphone 2 months before.It was functioning good but now left side of the headphone is not working.They say the product is for one year warranty from the date of purchase. But there is no response when i made a complaint.It's not worth the priceI prefered this  headphone looking at the brand, but  Im completely not satisfied with the product."
I prefer music lovers to buy this product.,5.0,"Sound quality is wonderful and pichi perfect HD quality, I prefer music lovers to buy this because I searched good Bluetooth earphones for 2weeks in Amazon I saw this product reviews and ratings I thought that before buying with average expectations and after using this I loved this product very much.Noise cancellation is perfect.While using if we go to long distance it will disconnect automatically and when going near to mobile it automatically connect to the mobile device in fraction of seconds."
"Good to buy for this range, but no noise cancellation",3.0,"Adding review after 4 months after I brought it. Headphone is good for music listener also good connectivity, good to buy at this range. No much of issue if you dont bother abt noise cancellation. There is no noise cancellation, during call person at the other side hear other background voice than our voice. There is no noise cancellation during call recording there is so much disturbance."
Not for athletes,3.0,"Good quality sound, but very heavy module that hangs on your neck. Cannot use it while working out as it keeps bouncing on your neck and shoulders and has also fallen down once.Other than that it's good value to the quality of sound"
Disappointed,3.0,"Battery life is OK... Sound quality is not good for the price... There is only bass in sound... Trouble, vocals are not clear... I found one thing more that Bluetooth connectivity... After connect the Bluetooth to your mobile after 3-4 minutes it keep saying that your earphones are connecting which is really irritating. There is no noise cancellation at all."
Superb product,5.0,Good product. Long lasting battery and value for money. This is my second set which I purchased. I will recommend this product.
Boat rockers ... Painful in a manner üòÖ,4.0,"The sound quality of the product is top class and the noise cancellation too. But the üëÇ ear hurts once we give it a proper fix inside for a day or two.Just a small suggestion, if u are buying the product just to sit and home or work and to listen to songs ...hmm look into some other product as long usages hurt the outer ear parts for some time . I don't know if it hurts in the beginning just because the product is new and isn't that much expanding."
Worst experience not allowing to replace faulty earphone,1.0,Worst experience.Order Earphones on 11 oct received on 13 oct but earphones are not even switching on and not working & main thing is not allowing to replace the order everytime giving popup of try next time.
DONT BUY CHECK MY REVIEW,2.0,PROS-I GOT FOR JUDT 1K ON SALEBASS IS GOODFOR PRICE OVERALL SOUND QUALITY IS DECENTCON-AT FRIST BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD AFTER USING FOR FEW WEEKS BATTERY LIFE STARTED DRAININGIT AS SEVERAL CONNECTIVITY ISSUES SOMETIMES IT DISCONNECTS AUTOMATICALLYAT MAX VOLUME SOUND WILL START DISTRACTINGCOMES WITH LONG WIRES WHICH LOOKS WEIRDDONT BUY THESE WIRELESS EARPHONE MORE THAN 1K
Very good,5.0,"This is the best quality earphones with great noise cancellation technique and very good sound quality. It's only drawback is it's great noise cancellation technique itself because I bought it for using while driving as I get too many calls, but while driving I'm not able to listen to the sound of other vehicle or horn. But in all its really good unless you're driving."
It's not bad,4.0,I would say it's good for it's price although mids and vocals are not that clear but it comes with good bass overall good .
Good.,4.0,"I bought this product almost a year ago, and has been working well since then. But now there are a few issues i am facing when i increase the volume. I don't think earphones should have a life so small. But if it fits your budget, then go for it."
Good sound quality and battery performance at affordable price,4.0,"Good battery life,  excellent sound quality at affordable price is the hallmark of BOAT. Only issue i face is the headset battery indicator is not accurate and u will have to form your own judgement as to when the headphone needs to be recharged. Overall good purchase, i have already recommended same to 4 other people who now are also happy with BOAT."
Faulty product,1.0,"Purchased on 22nd June 2021Unable to connect to bluetooth and hence cannot check the quality. Unfortunately, because of personal emergency we have not been able to test the product before return period ends. Would request if we can get the product exchanged as the product is faulty."
#boAthead,4.0,"Excellent ! Sound quality is good. Battery life is also good - 10% = 1hr (if you want better battery life prefer Rockerz 255 pro plus). Noise cancellation is the best. In case of Bass quality, it lacks a bit low but a bit only. Mic is also decent. Full charge in 1hr. Love this headphones."
"POOR, DISAPPOINTED",2.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Sound Quality is AverageNoise cancellation is good but in my device there was Noise coming from the INSIDEBass quality is  goodVERY uncomfortableAlso excessively largeWould highly prefer INFINITY (JBL)  N150Or Realme Wireless Buds( Bit expensive)If you are looking only for gymwear, prefer BOAT ROCKERZ 261"
This is the beast,5.0,"I ordered this and delivered in 17 October I daily use it 1 hour for Gaming but still it has 40%battry it's battry like a huge. It is the best neckband under 1500rs.It has best quality best packaging quality. But it's magnatic ear buds  isn't very good but still ok. You purchase this neckband, not bad"
Bluetooth earphones in budget.,3.0,"Got this for Rs.990 in sale, i purchased these phones fro my jog after my LG earphones stops working, it's serves the purpose for the price...but not satisfied with music quality. But can't complain due to the budget. You must spend 2500 bucks for music quality. Not a bad product also not great."
Not much impressive,5.0,Sound is good... Extra bass is really extra(more then necessary)...so it is a little bad...But worse things are1)mic quality and position are too bad2)ear speakers are too heavy and design is somewhat that do not fit to each and everyone3)there is nothing like noise cancellation...its just noise isolation4) length of cords is too much....Overall reviewüëáBoat produces better wired earphones then these
Not connecting to two devices simultaneously,2.0,"It says it can connect to two devices, but, it does not. You have to disconnect from first to connect to second. And then it takes too much time/tries to connect to the second one. It also lags if u connect it to laptop and watch Netflix, if you jump 10 minutes ahead, the voice quality deteriorates heavily.Sound quality is okayish. Got it at 999, still returned it."
Worst Mic,1.0,Worst Mic ever.I have used many earphones and headphones earlier but this one is the worst when it comes to mic.You won't be able to listen to the other person on call. Lot of noise it creates and they will be listening more of our surroundings.Don't go for it.But if you are stupid enough and only looking for a earphone which will serve your purpose of just listening music then go for it and make fool of yourself.
Battery pack up üëé,2.0,"Writing this review after 4months of usage, it shows in the box like it will lost long upto 10hours but honestly 100% battery only last long for maximum 2hours only really disappointed for this I'm charging 2 or 3times a day and sound quality is somewhat ok, i suggest go for some products like OnePlus realme etc.."
Not for iPhone users,3.0,Great work in android phone.. but not working good in iPhone..if you plan to buy for iPhone don‚Äôt buy.. some sound it‚Äôs come again again..
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM.,1.0,"The neckband stopped working in 10 days. I did not expect it from Boat company.I went to service center and it got replaced. once again in a week, same problem happened and it stopped working again and now I have again placed request to replace it.I think it has got some manufacturing defect and I advice NOT TO BUY IT."
boatrockers pro 225,3.0,"its an average product, magnet is poor quality,  other person doesn't get the sound proper, a big no for this product,  i had earlier bought boatrockers , was too good , expected same here but no, yes 1 thing is good it charges very fast compared the earlier ones"
Very much disappointed ..,1.0,Very poor quality.. good for listening music only.  To make calls it's utter waste... The mike captures all noise around even 5-8 meters away.. so the other person on call can't hear anything clearly... Very much disappointed..
Amazing Worthy Long Battery Headphone,5.0,Boat is very nice product in This budget..! Amazing Sound clarity .  Also 10hours of Playing and 150 hours standby charge. With 110mah..Bass 10/10Vocal-Treble9/10Battery 10/10 ..I prefer black because of rich look..And Volume and Track keys... Nice.. Great Boat team.. I got for 899 in offer Thanks Amazon..
Bad Bluetooth connectivity: gets disconnected often during call and cant hear anything,1.0,"Review after 2 week usage : Its very much annoying when the Bluetooth gets disconnected frequently during the call. Sounds wise great but drains phone battery tremendously . Keeps slipping off t ears, and dont stay on ur neck snuggly..Wish there was a return window"
For music lovers,3.0,"I loved the product as it is very comfortable in your ear. Good for those who love to listen music while working out.Sound quality is goodExcellent noise cancellationLoved the bassHowever, the right ear plug has got a defect within 2weeks.Cannot submit complaint as Boats website doesn't work."
Just Ok for the money,5.0,"Sound Quality Is goodfast charging is absolutely worth itIt charges accurately on 1 hourgives upto 3 hrs playback with 20 mins of chargingYou can Improve its sound quality by using music player like Powerampfit is good but can't wear a long timeIt is good value for money, when bought in offer"
Use and throw Headphone,1.0,"A nice little head phone, but only when it works. Within a month it stopped working. The warranty process is convoluted. Have to raise ticket online and wait for the company to arrange a pickup. It's been 30 days since rising warranty claim and nobody is on site to pick it up. No physical service center either that you could drop it in. At the end of day, you end up using it while it works and throw it when it stops working."
"Good experience with good price drop offer but can't take into ear for longer use, painful headache!",3.0,"Noise cancellation is pretty good, bass quality is nice, better sound but can't use it for a long time, these 2 rubber buds holders are very disappointing me, not holding properly into all size of ears. So u can't adjust this holder in to ur ear, and the sounds become so painful after 45mints - 1hrs."
Very bad Experiance with zoom/Hangout call with this,3.0,Only work well for Phone Call & music connected to mobil or laptopNot recommended for hangout/skype/zoomAutomatically disconnect & also mic stops frequently
Normal Earphones with Bluetooth Range Issues and Battery Drain issues,2.0,"Hello People,Earphones provides good sound and bass. Although it not worth to have Bluetooth earphone with battery drain issues and Bluetooth range is 1-2m.I find earphone giving issues and glitches in connections in calls and sound after 2 meters.Also Battery is below average with 2-3 hours max capacity.Best of all is Amazon does not provide return on this product, only exchange option is availble.Think twice before buying this product."
Great sound amd battery.,4.0,"Great earphone in sound and built quality but not that good in range. Sound quality is great, even earphone is balanced and stays back in your neck. Battery is also good as I've never counted on timer but yes more than 6 hrs. Earphone can run whole day or single charge. Butto s are good and all functional as told.Mic is too sensitive even small pin drop in room feels like loud sound to person on other side of call.I found only range and mic sensitivity issue, even sometimes sound lags when device is in your hand or pocket.I returned it on these 2 factors only, rest are good."
Clarity missing in product description,1.0,"There are good amount of customers and reviews.  It was not clarified by product owner whether it can connect with 2 devices and also switch them while in call.  Also, it doesnt mention about noise cancellation capability also.  Request you to upgrade the product description."
Waste of money.,1.0,"I have ever seen worst gadget. This device not connected to any mobile. I tried with 3 mobiles. I get irritated on this. One thing I don't understand that Y, Amazon give an option only to replacement but not to return. I think that it be making fraud with public. Because we need. I never recommend to any gadget to buy by Amazon."
The buds never fit and keep slipping out while excersizing,2.0,"The quality of sound and the noise cancellation is really good. However, the buds just don't stick in your ears. None of the sizes match your ears. I've tried it with many friends and it slips out of their ears. It's good for stationary stuff, but use it for running or any movement based excercise and it's definitely going to keep slipping out."
Best choice in this range,5.0,It was delivered yesterday to me and I'm writing this review after 1 day use and trust me i purchased many things but I'm writting review of product first time because it impressed me lot. The sound quality is really awesome and battery is pretty good backup and noise cancellation is also good but the best part of this product is range according to quality is nothing.If you are confusing to buy in compare to same range or under 2k then be practical this one is going to be best choice for you. I got this in 1200 on time of sale. Thanqu
Not good really bad,1.0,The prodect was not good because I am a student as I use my class and a reel in insta together the sound quality is really bad and I had one 200rs headset that performs very well its not good really bad also while we keep this in our ears when nothing is played there will me a small sound like irritating small sound is produced
Think once or twice before buying it,1.0,This product is a total waste of money. I bought it for 1500 rs on Aug 24 2019.it worked fine for 3 months and then one side of the earphone stopped working. I claimed warranty and the product was replaced with an old product which lasted only for 2 months. Now this has happened for the fourth time and each time i send it for a replacement it takes a month to get replaced.
Unbelievable Battery life,5.0,Unbelievable Battery life... Brought on 5th of October...today's date is 30th of November....not yet charged... battery is now about 40% ‚ò∫Ô∏èClear sound quality...must buy....
Clear sound. Plus noise reduction is extremely good.,5.0,"Everything is great. Its worth your money.Just one problemIt shows battery remaining at three levels only - 100% , 80% , 20% , and then dies. I am not sure if i am the only one facing this on my iphone or is this a generic problem.Other than this i am enjoying them a lot"
Best product from boat.,4.0,I purchase this product 999 rupees in big billion days sales. I received defected piece with not working mic. But amazon  replace my product in 7 days. Now new piece working very fine.Sound and base Quality is good. Battery backup is around 8 hours.
WORST EVER !!,1.0,This product is so horrible its not working within 1 month !! And the online complaint portal dosent accept complaint for this model as well !! So I just wasted Rs.1000 in 1 month !! Worsttttt product ever by BOAT !! Would never buy again !!!!!

Build qualit and battery backup is good,4.0,Battery backup is superb... Used for 14 days (1-2 hours usage per day)without charging even once.  May be because it is new.Boat team have met their commitment
Okay but needs lot of improvement . Value for money,2.0,"Noise cancellation is okay.Pros1. Good connectivity and voice clarity2. Easy to handleCons1. Charging point very small2. Wires may bend and get damaged3. Magnet not effective and does not pause music when attached4. Battery shows 100%, 80%, 20% and then straight off.I think it will work maximum one year if we handle with care. I purchased for 999/-Wait for this price and buy. Worth only this"
Best below 1500/,5.0,Got this for 1099/ . Would say..the quality is good. Not Great.  Best in budget.. If one is looking for work from home earsets. Mic quality is clear and no issues on the other end.If your budget is under 2k. This is the One. If you can exceed 2500...go for One+
"Just go for it, (255 pro version)",5.0,"Best for outdoor/indoor usage (atleast for me it's outdoor) , I am no music expert but sound quality is great , no lag, it's very hard to hear someone while using this and can connect two devices at once. 6-8 hrs battery life in my case( after using approx 4 months), 20 min charge for 4 hrs playback, sweat & water resistant ."
A1 quality headphone in budget.,5.0,"""Sound quality"" -superb! 4.6/5""Noice cancelation"" - average 3.5/5""Build quality"" - superb! 4.6/5""Bettery life""- beyond expectations 5/5Overall i love this gadget. I'm using it since 1 and 1/2 years, same sound quality even after 1.5 year. (Whenever anyone asks me which headphone to buy in budget ,i always reffer ""boat"".)"
Worst Product,1.0,"This is the worst product, received from seller. I am expecting some decent products here. The quality of the product is really bad. They stop working after 10 days. Where you can't even replace or return the product. Finally you will end up with a useless product.Please don't buy this ."
Great experience,4.0,Looking for long lasting bluetooth headset with Good clear sound quality. Go for it. 1 hour of charge can lasts for around 30 hrs as per my experience.
best in price,4.0,"using this product since one month,great sound quality,good build quality,also flexible,battery backup is also good.Only one thing i didnt like is bluetooth range..its not the best..but good..Overall the earphones are great at this price.you will not regret after buying this."
The product could be much better at this price,4.0,"The product is good, but I did not like the product packing. The box looked very low quality. Apart from that the sound quality is good. Noise cancellation is average but the mike on the earphone is very bad. The mike catches all the disturbance which is nearby apart from your voice which makes the other person on the call not able to hear anything."
Try it first.,4.0,"I waste a lot money to find some good quality in famous brands,  but I found this product in good price. It's sounds effect is good,  battery backup is very good overall i can say value of money.Thank you."
Don't buy. Very poor quality.,1.0,I bought these earphones few months back. The sound quality was good but the earphones were damaged within 6 months. Both the sides are not working. The 1 year warranty seems like a scam as even after registering a complaint no boat executive gets back. On calling customer service the calls remain unconnected and there is no follow up from them. Please don't buy as earphones have no longevity and getting through customer service is a pain.
Worst service  by amazon,1.0,After 5 months left side of bluetooth is not working and as mentioned it is having warrenty of 1 year so contacted customer service for help to replace the product Didnt get any help from them .The reply from them was to contact manufacturer  this is overall Amazon's responsibilty to resolve all this issue .It is not customers responsibilty to contact manufacturer for this issues.Dissatisfied with Amazon service. I will never recommend Amazon.
Good product -worst customer service by BOAT dealer,1.0,"After 6month of usage one of the side not working, when checked on website this is common problem and worst part customer service is not good they do not pick call. It's better not to buy-people can save their precious time."
Didn't last for even one month,1.0,Initially sound n base quality is good but in few days one of speaker will stop functioning  moreover 9th Nov I purchase and now 28th November headphone is not workingThere is not a single scratch or wire or breakageThis means either online products r useless or fake or may be not fit for regular use
After 2 days one side sound gone away,1.0,I think they send the used product. After 2 days of use one side not working means sound gone.nobody willing to solve the problem.and I miss the return window ( too much short). *Waste of money*..Plz don't buy this product they didn't support u which they claim..
Very Low Bass & Non Refundable,2.0,"I bought this product as I thought it would be good in bass as I have used wired in-ear earphones of boat but I never thought it would be not as good as it should be and when I wanted to return the item, it says it's non refundable, it can only be replaced but can't be refunded. I want to know why?"
Waiting for boat to release updated version,4.0,Great deal at 999 actually it's a steal at that price point i only wish they will release the next version with better featuresWishlist*I wish the earphones will stop playing as soon as the magnet's are connected like one plus and will autoplay as soon as disconnect tgis is the only feature i wish it had*Type-C usb charging*Improved battery*Improved sound quality
Worst product,1.0,"Worst product & waste of money, unlucky that I checked the product after completion of return date and now have to bare the loss of  Rs.1700/-, as can hear the sound from one side head set only, did not expected this from AMAZON.Won't recommend anyone for this product and AMAZON.Extremely worst as I bought it to gift my spouce on account of our 1st Anniversary.Worst product and the dealer."
sound quality us best,4.0,Well i likee this earphn very much. go for it‚ù§Ô∏è sound quality base and everything is goood. its comfortable and the charge lasts till 2 or 1 and half days. I was looking for a nice headphns with good base and sound quality. thanks amazon. i got this on discounted price. quality and shipping was also kinda goood.
It is no working after some month don't waste your money.,1.0,"Warranty is only for paper, no customer support after going care, Battery defect piece received but, no claim against it , they only give reason , i had not get support from customer care. Strongly do not buy this product, older version was better than it."
Best in this range! üëå,4.0,"This wireless earphone is good product. You can't say it's the best...But yeah I got it in 999 and it's best in this range. If you're looking a headphone ideal for bollywood music, it's good to go. But if you love sufi, ghazals, semi - classical genre, you'll be little disappointed! But what would you expect under 1000 bucks!"
Connectivity Problem Faced,1.0,Connectivity is not so good. Due to various reasons you would hear from your phone and the Headphone speaker simultaneously.That's the big issue of Boat 255Pro+.It's really a big problem.Like you're talking some confidential talks with your colleagues and everybody heard it without you knowing anything.üòí
"Great battery life, good base",5.0,"Bass - very goodVoice - midTreble- mid to highTotal Volumes- midBattery back- really good  (lasted 2 to 3 days with 20%remaining,  with 4-5 hours of active listen video and music)"
Below 40% we can not use this blootooth,2.0,I am writing this after using 16 days of my blootooth. When battery coming at 40% it's getting disconnected and connected multiple times....so battery backup is not good. Till 60% we can use after that have to connect in charging. It's around 2 days we can use after single charging approx 20hr. But in product it's showing 40hr battery backup.
Good for the price but needs little tuning.,4.0,Good for the price.Sound is loud.bass is loud. Little tuning is required.battery is decent.Zyada details leneki zarurat nahin.
BOAT ROCKS!!!,5.0,"It is awesome at high!!Lows and Mids not clear at low volume. But at high you will be ""Only in your own World"" +++Gets connected automatically once paired. Fits well, good while running or gym.Best purchase below 1000. One more thing that pushed me to buy this apart from price is ONE YEAR REPLACEMENT WARRANTY. Wow!! What else can you ask for 1k? Go for it, if you're aiming to buy Neckband below 1250/-"
Excellent,5.0,If you are music lover it is very convenient and excellent choiceThe operation quality and price are reasonableThe battery back up is goodClarity is calling..... Are v. Good
Sound quality,3.0,Sound quality is good but when u r in very busy area like in railway station airport the Bluetooth gets disconnected.....üòë. U have to connect it again and again or music gets stop overall it's good for ur daily purpose like if u are a college student it's best for u...üëç One more thing i want to mention that for calling purpose it's not so good...coz noise cancelation is very poor....
a better product in this price range,3.0,"sound quality is good but not as the Boat Wired Earphones provide yet better than Boult BT Earphones (i replace boult with this boat product),  bass is good but not clear, worst part is that tiny charging Jack cover. its too tiny and weak that i have lost it in just 4-5 days. battery backup is ok it gave me 5-6 hours backup. another worst part is sometimes you can't take a call because it goes blank on call.. product quality is good.. overall."
"Good sound quality, however not durable.",3.0,"I enjoyed this product all this while till now, from last week one one side is not working. I purchased it 10 months ago, unable to visit service centre due to lock down. Hopefully they will honour 1 year replacement warranty."
Best budget bluetooth earphones,5.0,"It is one of the best Bluetooth based wireless earphones currently available in the market. The battery backup usually lasts up to 8 hours of continuous music listening. Since it is in-ear design, hence noise cancellation is good, however, it lacks active noise cancellation, which I am sure is not present in any product of a similar cost.Overall, it is a must buy and good to have."
Suddenly power off,1.0,"I am very disappointed by this Product  ....I have ordered this Boat rockers 255 pro + on Feb 2021 .... While playing music the power button  suddenly switched Off.....So, i throught its switched off due to battery less then i have charged it, even we keep charging also no indicator symbol also""Finally its not working"""
It's a decent product at that price tag,4.0,It's my first day of use and the product is overall good as expected but just one dissapointing thing is the Bluetooth connectivity it cuts off in between which is not pleasing when your listening to songs otherwise the sound clarity and bass is no doubt quality and up to the mark just the connectivity factor is something which bothers me let's hope it gets better in days...
"""Good product""",3.0,"I have been using this on 14/05/2021 & it works well. ""Sound quality"" and ""bass quality"" all features are nice.Just make sure when you get this Bluetooth, check it well because when I first got this on first time, one of the sound button was not working so I had to exchange it, so it's kinda bummer at the moment."
Please Don't buy this product.. Waist of money.,1.0,Only use 1.5 months use battery life 2 Hours charge only 5min backup only standby mode without music. just call only 4/6 min workingReally faltu product.
low sound very bad product dont buy this,1.0,"very low sound coming even in 100% volume, very bad product ear buds are also big"
Overall 100% worth. Very good product with this range earphones,4.0,"Reviewing after use. Rated out of 51)Sound quality - 5 (little bit over bass)2)mic quality - 5 (super noise cancellation)3) Meterial quality- 3(look like poor quality plastic)4) battery - 5 (super battery life)5) prize - 5 (worth 100% with overall)6) comfortability-5 (no ear pain,low weight so easy to carry)"
Boss Bluetooth headset,4.0,Hi AllLooking for a blue tooth headset with a decent price of Rs.1000/- no doubt please go ahead in Boat Bluetooth headset.Overall product quality is good and bass is excellent.I have 3 boat products 1. Ear Pod 2. Bluetooth Headset 3. Boat bass thump headset. All of them gives more clarity in terms of sound & bass.Happy  listening to music in Boat.
Not for cardio,4.0,overall the sound and everything is great but I wouldn't recommend it for any sort of hard workouts if that's your main purpose! and these are definitely not for running! I brought these especially for working out and running didn't serve the purpose for me! If you are looking for wireless earphones just for the purpose of running and workout Id strongly recommend not to buy any neckband sort wireless earphones!ps: their sound is the amazing and best companion for travelling and also the battery is totally amazing!!
Earphones are not working and got replaced with new product,4.0,"After 45 days my Earphones are stopped working.. I have registered my complaint in boat website, with my invoice. After that, xpress bees agent came and take the my earphones after 15days i.e., 20th Nov'19 they sent a replacement product and now it's working fine without any issues. Thank you boat team for the replacement..."
Best Bass earphones.,5.0,"Best headphone for this price range mids, bass and treble are at good tuning. Bass is a bit Punching which is nice for bass heads. There is no big lag in time but found a little lag in gaming audio. Neckband is extremely light weight can't feel it like wearing and flexible too."

Not very comfortable to wear for long time,3.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†My ear starts paining after wearing it. Buds do not fit my ear properly and fall off"
Worth for money,5.0,I have also doubted to buy this product after seeing some reviews here. but I decided to buy & I don't regretted for that. I am enjoying this product much.crazy bass & battery last long for a week and just 1 hr full charge attained. What else we need just go ignore negative reviews and go for it!!
charging does not stand....,1.0,"Even though there was a good rating about the product which prompted me to buy this,  the product's charging does not stand by and everytime when I use I have to charge...."
Excellent Bluetooth Earphones below 1500...,5.0,"1sf of all, I have to thank to Amazon..for the delivery. The product delivered the next day of order.. Coming to the Product...I'm writing this review after using 1 week.. excellent product for it's price point... Sound quality is awesome..Best Bluetooth under 1500 rs...But the only problem is that.. battery Lasts 6 hrs continuous music play... which is enough.."
Not a good choice- retured,2.0,There will be continuous humming voice in background which will be irritating while pausing/playing sound.Not suitable for calling.mic is not that good quality.one more demerit is that rubber strap on earphone. that is just sticked with glue which gets off in 3 days only.Though purchased for only rs.955/- even returned for bad quality
No refund policy,1.0,"I don't like the quality of this product.I tried to return this product and buy a different one. But there is no return and refund policy.There is only replacement policy.The item is not worth more than ‚Çπ900.My recommendation is, don't buy this product. Go for newer versions."
Good sound but Poor battery quality,1.0,"I have bought 2 of this headsets recently.. sound very good for the price.. one headset is still working fine, the other one's bettery life drastically reduced, infact it's really a damaged battery.. i don't recommend this product because of the poor quality checks"
Pathetic customer support and service team,1.0,"Poor customer service, bad quality of product, product will stop fucntioning after few months and when you will send this for replacement their customer service and support team will never send a replacement. You will see your case closed and they will keep the product with them... It's a total waste of money and time.. better go for any other brand who are providing better customer support and better quality of product."
Product problem,2.0,"Dear Amazon Team,Please note I had booked a Boat Rockerz Bluetooth earphones from Amazon, it received in intact condition and was working fine, but now it is not working at all.When you plug in the charger the LED is working and earphones are working & as soon as the charger is removed the earphones stop workingRequesting you to kindly replace these earphones at the earliestAwb: 221921225468Regards,"

Technical Values Should Improve More,1.0,"See Guys This Product is AwesomeNo Change in this one . But after few Days oly it started Irritating me like hell . Issues like not getting paired , continuously being in On Position , Even Now while Im writing this Review Same Prolem Persists . im fedup of this Product , Feeling like to throw this Somewhere. One Time Properly Working Cannot Change Entire Usage Review"
This is value for money because of its looking and sound quality under 1300 rs.,5.0,First I purchase then I receive a fake product but again I purchase then I receive original product. If you get boat rockerz 255 r and boat rockerz 255f then don't buy it . But if you get boat rockerz 255 then you have to buy it . For any concern you may contact customer care because customer care is so supportive of Amazon
Misleading fake picture!,1.0,The picture gives an impression that it is all soft wire but one half of it is ugly hard plastic. Unrealistic picture! Wasted my money. I could have put another 300 rs and bought a JBL wireless earphone that's all soft wire!
"Good bass, best for music. Refrain making calls, intermediate battery life",3.0,"The bass is amazing. It's good for listening to music. Fit may vary, I have issues with left ear fit. The mic does not cancel background noise, it's a nightmare for person on other side of the call. The battery life is short."
One month review bad quality.,1.0,One month reviewThe headphones won't  charge didn't expect this kind of quality from boats.To claim the warranty I will have to take it to boat service center 23 km away from where I live.
MADE IN INDIA product with nice battery back up,5.0,very solid reason to buy this is it's MADE IN INDIA.second look and sound quality is very good.
Good Bluetooth device in this cost,5.0,"Sound quality is good,worth for money but packaging is worst box is damaged but god's grace product is safe so please my request to amazon please give us safe and secure packing for products"
Absolute delicacy for soft music lovers.,4.0,"It's a very good neckband. Music is soft and bass is decent. Great for listening music for long hours. Calls are very clear. Battery back up is mind blowing. Build quality is great and it fits in my neck smoothly. Though plastic made, it's sturdy and light weight. Overall it's a great choice. Go for it."
WFH special (7th time ordered it),5.0,"I am using this product from last three years, I guess.Moreover, as the pandemic started, I've started using it for calling to be in lesser contact to my phone screen.It's truely amazing product and I'm now addicted to this.It's my 7th purchase üòç"
Service after product issue was worst,2.0,"It was dead after 4 months, it mentioned like it is water resistant, but when I went with dead headphones, they said water went inside so warranty won't cover. Service centre was worst, it is not boat service centre, boat tied up with Micromax which is worst service centre ever I faced. Not interested to give best service to customers."
It worth for this price range.,5.0,It's good to listen songs and you will get an excellent. The noise cancelling is average but it is extremely comfortable when  you use it and give an extream bass and sound quality it is 100% worth for this price range. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS IS YOUR LOOKING FOR A GAMING HEADSET IT'S GOOD FOR GAMING BUT NOT GREAT.....!!!!!!!
DON'T EVEN THINK TO BUY,1.0,Very very poor quality.Even poorer the service. Earphone got damaged just within 6 months and not able to get the service also. I have put earphones on replacement but even after two months there is no sign of replaced product. They picked up the damaged product in just 7 days but when it comes for replacement it takes ages.Highly recommended NOT TO BUY.
Try it yourself.,1.0,"Just keeping my phone in my pocket resulted in lose of Bluetooth connectivity.Maybe only my earphones had that defect.. others may not have to face it. Buy the product, us it for 2-3 days. If good keep it or else there's a return option in Amazon.I've returned it though."
Bad customer services,2.0,"Please remain cautious before buying this headphone set because in my case, the left earpiece has stopped working in under 3 months of my purchase. There is no support from boat either. No responses and pick and drop facilities make all hopes dilute. Really disappointed in boAt's customer service.#shame #boatisnotgood #badexperience"
Good but not the best,4.0,"The product is good.Sound is almost acceptable at the priceGood bass thoughNoise cancellation is decentThe eartips are not that comfortable for long time useBattery last about 3 days as per my usage of daily 3-4 hours of useBuilt quality and design is goodLove the magnet concept, helps to keep the earphones in placeThey could have added the pause feature if possibleIf you get a good deal go for it"
Best value for money in this price segment,5.0,First of all boat is an Indian company. And they are offering really good quality products. My experience with Bluetooth headset is too good. Plus in case you are quite unsure about your needs then they are also providing easy replacement and return policy which is another plus point according to me for recommending this product.
"Fairly decent, could be better.",3.0,I have been experiencing range issues that whenever I put the phone in my pocket the music goes off. Bass feels too loud sometimes and suppresses the higher frequency sound but it's not very deep. But I guess it's okay at this price.
Unbalanced voice right side low volume,1.0,"Got it in Rs. 899 and started loving it... but gradually noticed unbalanced voice.. right side volume is low as compared to left one. Found dust on the earphones when i opened box, it was packed ok but disappointed by overall sound performance in 2 days only.. i decided to replace üòë"
Total failure of this product,1.0,Hello boat teamI purchased this product on 10th august 2021. After 1 week of usage it stopped working. Then i requested for replacement. After replacent again the earphone stopped working in 4 days. Really disappointed from ur product quality.Worse experience.
Worth it,4.0,"Sound quality: a bit disturbance in sound when you go beyond 5 metres from your Bluetooth source.Bass: no words.  It's boombasticNoise cancellation : it's actually more than enough I wonder if somebody bang into a tree while running. It's that level of noise isolationI thing price must be 1200 because 1500 is a bit expensive in this range because better earphones are available in this price range +- 200 .Buy it it's worth ,atleast worth than 4000 cost earphones .Jai hind vandematram"
Short life of that earphone.not for daily usage.,5.0,"Product is very good, good sound quality specially bass,battery life is also ok but not very good..but this is not for daily basis use,i used till 2 months but the wire of that earphone got problem,it became onesided earphone...i used it for my workout and travell and it got problem in wire..so its not for daily basis work.life is very less of that earphone...if  u are going to purchase that so think more according to ur usage...otherwise product is quality is very good but not have long life.."
Boat is the trusted brand to go. Absolutely Value of money,5.0,"Im a kind of headset freak, was already having bunch of wired headsets and few wireless as well. I must say that by 2k u wont get any better product than this.In all perspective be it as bttery capacity, sound clarity, when taking calls I believe it out performs all the other BT earphones atleast in 2k budgeted earphones.Have a collection of BOAT branded earphones & wireless speakers, from that experience i can honestly say that BOAT never disappoints u."
"Apart from top quality sound, everything else is fine.",4.0,"Looks great, great build, light weight. Very long wires, Sound quality is moderate not up to the mark. Low Bass. Mic and calling functions are great. Boat is a trustworthy brand. Very very overpriced. Connectivity is good, easy to connect and use."
Sub-standard: promised more than they can deliver.,1.0,"Multiple issues with the product.1. Non water-resistant inspite of IPX7 rating.  Power failure with minimal water exposure.2. Consistent buzz sound whenever audio is paused. It continues for about a minute.3. In attempt to improve bass, overall audio quality compromised. Audio is discomforting.4. Cannot use AAC codec with this."
Disappointed,3.0,"After using for two months, not felt good with the purchase. I have an Ant product brought 2 year back gives better experience."
Terrific purchase at this price.,5.0,"1) Have been using this for an year..still sound crisp and clear.2) Build quality of wire is durable.3) Buds are comfortable in ears.4) Base is good at this price.5) Call quality is excellent, although noise cancellation is not that much good.Definitely go for this if u have this budget."
Low microphone voice pick up,2.0,The microphone is not picking my voice as good as wired earphones. I am unable to do voice and video recording with good audio quality like i do with normal wired earphones
Bluetooth headphones,2.0,"I bought this product in Jan-2019. At first I would like to say about sound quality. The sound quality is good, and its valued for the price. As the time passes I faced few connecting issues. The main problem is with the quality of ear phones. After 9 months of purchase I faced a issue that one of my earphone isn't working. As my product is still under warranty, got it repaired. Then again after 9 month's I faced the same issue. So lost trust in Boat earphone as the product itself can run for nine months and their service will help in running another 9 months. So I would say that if u wanna use it for an yr then go for it. Else take your decision"
Stopped working,1.0,"Stopped working after 1 week usage, not durable and battery back up is not up to mark. no response from customer service centre. very disappointed"
Go for it!!,5.0,Amazing product by boat. Bought rockerz 255 pro+. Sound quality is awesome and bass is also vry good. Battery lyf is appropriate. Firstly I didn't believed while seeing the product details on Amazon of40 hrs playback I didn't believe but when I received the product I myself tested it and its true that it gives 40 hrs playback. Happy to use!!
Worst,1.0,Worst Product don't wast u r mony
Huge Disappointment do not look at it also,1.0,I have experienced good sound quality but having issues with its charging and battery life. Charging indicator is not working and battery life from 60% to 0% it gets over in 15 min. I am surprised with this product. Had high expectations from it as many have purchased it. Now I feel I should have purchased Sony or real me product. As it‚Äôs only 2 months that I have used this product.
This is beyond my expectations.,5.0,More than what I expected. I always brought high end earphones and lately understood that high-end earphones are not worth the price.Hence I went for this budget one (1100 rs).Its really awesome .It‚Äôs quality is equal to the high end earphones I had.Never expected such a excellent sound output.There is a good balance between Bass and Treble.Lightweight and raging red colour addsup to the euphoria it creates. Unmatchable sound quality for this price and comfortable wear.
Bluetooth Connectivity Failed,2.0,"The bluetooth stops connection in between, like dosent even connect in 10m rang, it's Amazon's choice of product when ordered, I put my trust in Amazon and that's not how they deliver products without checking their durability. Can't even replace the item. It been xact 15 days I have purchased it. Never had a complain from Amazon till date, this is the first and also cannot connect to their customer service."
Bad.. Bad.. Bad..,1.0,Very bad experience.. Bought it for calling and onlime class purpose but this is very disappointing.. Mic position is very bad and it feels bulky on one side which make it uncomfortable.. Battery life is good but who will wear it for longer time if it is not comfortable.
Worst product,1.0,The sound is like low budget earphone. Boat is a good brand but the sound quality is not adequate. I applied for refund to amazon
Boat rockers really rocks.,5.0,"Sound quality is excellentMic is sensitive but with excellent noise cancellation, if you speak to someone while walking on road noise cancellation did excellent job. I'm using it for about 90 days and i'm satisfied with this earphones.Bass is good not excellent.Battery backup is excellent it will run 1 and half day with full chargingü§©Go for this product."
Colour not same as shown in picture,2.0,"I ordered teal green colour earphone.In real, the colour is not same as shown in picture.I didn't like the colour I received but as there is no return policy i had to keep it."
Good buy,4.0,"Great product. Have been using it from past 1 year.Good sound quality, great battery life, awesome bass effects.Cons:It gave me ear pain over prolonged usage.The rubber cover over the micro USB port breaks down after multiple uses."
Worst product don't buy at all,1.0,My suggestion if company give you a product at free of cost kindly perfer any other company product as these product required servicing on every two month.On 21st sep i was again register complaint it's Stop working and these is my thrid time where register complaint.I feel company should learn from any other brand how Bluetooth earphone made and work for longtime.In this duration I hardly used for two month remaining six month i was registered complaint and getting replacement.

Warranty process is Zero totally bad,1.0,Boat product is very good but there warranty process is very bad . I have taken 1 earphone with warranty and after 12 month they are denying there warranty (I have order on 1 nov 2020 but I got my product on 7nov and add a complain on 1nov2021 but there process time is of 24 hour so on 2 nov they are denying for warranty.
Good but worst,3.0,"Sound quality is best but battery life is worst , I buied it a month ago with1 year warranty but one side of my neckband stopped working after a week when I bought and when I tried to contact the service center or tried to claim it for warranty they declined my requestWorth for money but I recommend not to buy"
Good earphones at a good rate.,5.0,Good quality earphones. Used it for more than 3 weeks. Not at all disappointed. The battery backup is good. Must buy. Really happy with the product.
Works as expected. Read for yourself.,3.0,The sound lag is much less and noise cancellation is great. I never had any issues with Bluetooth connectivity as I keep my phone in my hand or pocket when using it.It doesn't hurt your ears if you wear it properly. The only problem I can see is the battery back up system. It has low battery capacity and after giving you the warning of low battery it hardly gives you 10 mins. So that's the only problem I face. So for me it's a good choice.
Best earphones in this range.,4.0,"I ordered this product an year ago and till now I have not faced any issue with this being it battery or sound. The only problem is that when it's on low battery level it won't last long, not even 5 mins and keeps on repeating batter low battery low. Apart from that it's great. 1.25 hrs of charging last 5-6 hours non-stop and 8-9 hours at max on standby."
Very small battery and disconnects when not in use,3.0,"I have been using samsung Level U for any years and this dissappointed me as battery back is so weak, cannot even use for 2 days with normal usage. It disconnects when not in use, again bit of a disconfort as you have to pair turn on and connect when you receive a call."
Gets disconnected suddenly,2.0,"I like BOAT products, but this one's a disappointment... It disconnects suddenly in the middle of use even though Bluetooth is still connected to it. I don't know whether the product is faulty or it's the default issue by company."
The wort quality earphones.,1.0,The product sent was broken and damaged . It had already been used before it was sent to us by amazon. These were the worst headphones. In just 2 mins i saw that they were broken after i recieved the parcel. Horrible quality earphones. Even the logo was removed and the earphones has scratches all over it .
Dont buy at any cost,1.0,Totally waste product... Bought on june 10 2021 and it worked for 15 days only and return time also very less upto 18th june. So i could not able to return also...Its very very very worst product... Please dont buy...This is my personal experience... Go for boult not for boat.
help me in claiming warranty,1.0,I brought this product last year .still my product is in warranty but during 6 th month from  purchase right side stopped working ....totally disapointed ...I request amazon authority to help me in claiming warranty on my product.
Bad.....very bad.....worst......,1.0,"Only a month gone its gets disconnect automatically. Now switched off no light no response, dnt know what to do. I promise i will never buy electronics item through any online portal. This is second time i lost my hard earn money. First time boat eardopes rs 3000 wasted within 6 mnths ut was stop working. Now boat rokerz 255 i must sat worst brand ever i have used so far."
Fine for the price range,3.0,"Some cons-1) The bass is way to heavy, if your device doesn't cone with any inbuilt equalizer to tone down the base a bit you might wanna stay away as the overall base is way to overpowering.2) The Bluetooth connectivity is somewhere along the bad side, the connection sometime gets weakened while carrying the phone in trouser pockets.Still somehow for the price range these earphones do pretty much what is needed."
Low quality,2.0,"My first impression after unboxing - Low quality product, wires are extraordinary long, ear buds are not at all ergonomically designed, Does not get fit into ears and itself  pop out of the ears. After all this experience didn,t feel like checking out sound quality. Company is playing smart not offering return option. Now have to live with this low quality product."
FAKE SELLERS!,1.0,"The first time I purchased it, the charging cable and manual was not there. I got it replaced, just today I got my replacement. The charging cable is still not there. Even after mentioning the details while replacing product, I guess no one has reviewed the comments and got the replacement done.At least a customer deserves genuine product. I needed to gift this to someone."
Perfect and strong build but sound quality isn't enough,2.0,Perfect and strong build but sound quality isn't enough.The metal was too strong.It is Water resistant #testedEven after I've met an accident its still working perfectly.But the earpiece was too big and it may cause pain in the ears.Doesn't fit while sleeping or wearing a helmet.Sound quality was much better..!!A bit noisyBut everything  else is perfect..!!
Nice,5.0,This product is my 3rd one. One was not working. I booked 2nd time it was worked 8 months properly then one side not working. I raised a query. Boat life style support website gives a ticket number. It was till pending now. I ordered 3rd one now ü§£üôè.
"Just awesome sound quality, battery backup and notice cancelation",5.0,"I just wanted to buy a good Bluetooth earphones in my budget.. And boat 255 is exactly that what I need.. The sound quality and nocie cancellation is awesome, really it's too good, company says with 10 mnt chrg it can play upto 45.but in my case the time was 85 mnt with 65% volume.. And with 65% volume you can enjoy 7to8 hours music..Mujhe lagta hai boat ki is headset ki age isi budget mai or koi takkar dene ke liye hai e nehi.. Dude just go for itüëçüëç"
Good product,4.0,"Bluetooth Earphone with this price is great, Sound quality and bass is superb, noice cancellation is not upto the expectation. You can purchase for regular usage like, watching movies, and for music, attend meetings.Worth for every penny no regret of purchase"
Do no buy this product,1.0,"<b>Do no buy this product</b>I purchased this 13 months back, since last one month after completeing 1 year warranty period its start giving me many problems, outmost problem is: it gives me 2 hrs of use in full charge company claims 10 hrs.Do no buy this product."
Best Earphones so far!,5.0,"The best earphones I've come across.The color is my favourite which attracted me and then the sound quality of earphones is too good. It does have good noise cancellation. The battery power is also nice. Overall is a really good product by boat. Enjoying it since March, 2021."
Boat always my first choice!!,5.0,"The earphone are just awesome, it serve all your basic purpose -Sound - 10/10Bass - 10/10Durability is much better than other fancy brands, also get easily adjusted in your we ears. As I purchased at just 800 bucks I can say it's full paisa vasool deal"
Waste of money,1.0,Waste productDon't by anyone because it was failed product and within 5 months it cause damage and and there is no warranty at all and the company is cheating us I was wexed with this product
Worth the money..,4.0,The overall performance is worth the money... But what i wanted more was the buttons for the next song or to go back to the previous song...Noise cancellation is good and every other mode of performance is good... Battery backup is great.....Perfect product in all ways for the money spent....
It's sky blue and not ocean blue,3.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†The colour is not ocean blue it's sky blue. I replaced it thinking I received the wrong one but even the replaced item was sky blue. Check the color of the item and then mention in the description. Many people buy it for ocean blue color so think and check twice."
Highly Recommended,5.0,This is the 4th product of boat I have bought and this is as good as the previously bought headphones.In this price range these are far better than any other brand.Pros.Battery backup is very good.Bass is excellent.Sweat proof.Very good build quality.Cons.Packaging can be more better.
it's all about spec but I don't understand when I will get my refund ......,4.0,noise cancellation was worstwhile listening music connectivity was good but when I use for call after 15 min next person cannot hear our voice not at all.bass is great but it direct impacts on ear drum.Actually I need Bluetooth earphone for call but that purpose was not solving so I returned it .I have return earphone on 4feb 2020 till today I didn't receive my refund . what is this Amazon doing ... when I will get my refund???
"Failure product,later replaced the product on 28th november at service centre",5.0,"On 24th sep the product was delivered and on 28th oct the right side earphone stopped working....even my two other friends bought for them.the same issue..No physical damage happened but it stopped working..i recommend not to buy this peoduct...This product is a failureAlmost most of them have same issueOn 28th nov visited service center, they replaced the product and gave a new working product...."
Good..,4.0,The product is good for the price i paid 999.but i have a doubt whether its an original boat earphones.cuz the brand mark is nowhere engraved.just printed on the band.and its a long than expected..And Guys the battery backup is just 2-2.5hrs
Very nice but less life,3.0,"Sound quality and bass quality are very great everything are very great but it took 1 year after we purchased from Amazon now it is not charging properly and battery dead I bought it for 2699 , I am having warranty according to card but not to Amazon if possible kindly exchange my product with"
"One side issue,  bluetooth issue and no noise cancellation",4.0,"I have bought 3 Boat Rockers 255 in last 1 year and in exactly 6-7 months one side of earphone stopped working in all 3 earphones. After complaints Boat team replace the product but such issue is not expected from Boat....Also Bluetooth connection takes 25 minutes with every new device.No noise cancellation at all, person other side on call will be able to listen a fan noise too...."
Poor battery,1.0,"I have been using this for over a month now, and find that, the power drains out real fast.  The complete charge takes anywhere between 1.5 to 2 hours and , lasts for only, 4-5 hours.  Today just on a 5 minute charge, it showed 80% charged!, Really??.  While sound quality, noise cancellation is just about ok, the power back up required to make use of these features, is way too poor, and most of the time you will find the headphones switched off dead as a duck!"
Disappointed,2.0,"I am disappointed with this, I am using airdopes 441 but this earphones battery do not last even a day....I can't return also now as its month old."
"Very bad product, not value for money.",1.0,"The product has one major problem that it gets disconnected automatically number of times and then gets connected automatically which is very disturbing. I regret to buy this product but the return window is closed otherwise I would have returned this product. I've got two headphones of boat but I have now decided not to buy boat headphones ever again in future. The magnet is very weak, even battery is not good."
It doesn‚Äôt work for a long time,1.0,These earphones have good sound and good bass to it but it breaks very easily. I‚Äôm hoping I can get a refund or a new pair. It worked well for few months but all of a sudden the left ear piece stopped working. This has happened to my friends also so I‚Äôm not the only one facing this problem.Hope I can get a new one because I suffering with any earphones.Thank you
Bad quality Bluetooth connectivity,1.0,"I am not sure why this product has so high rating as this product is below average quality. While in call, this headphone is not clearly audible and makes noise, disturbance to person on call.I contacted Amazon 2 weeks ago and even customer rep said voice was distorted, so requested for return as this product as it not working properly. I have not heard anything from this company or amazon"
Good sound quality but not perfect for attending calls,4.0,Nice product. Sound quality is good.The only problem which i faced is the receiver keeps complaining of low voice when on call.Good for listening songs and watching videos.But for attending calls i didn't find it that good
Sound Quality very poor and volume very very low,1.0,"I received this item today. Right side sound is very very low. Besides, it doesn't stay in the ear even after trying with Big, Medium and Small ear clip came with the package. I do not recommend! I am returning the item and requesting for the refund. Thanks."
Good product,3.0,"Battery backup is average.You cannot connect it during charging.Charging time is very less.There is no way to listen it in low battery, every two to three seconds, voice comes up to notify you the battery status.But overall a good product, 3.4/5 stars."
Worst earphones ever,1.0,"Don't buy this product. This is the worst thing ever I had buy. If you claim for the warranty you will wait more than 15 days and it will definitely give some issues within 3 months.I have 2 boat rocker and both of them gave problem so don't buy this product.If you want so you can take realme, JBL or one plus earphone. I am not giving promotions and all I am telling you the fact."
Great quality sound and comfort,4.0,The earphones certainly delivered more than expected. The bass and beats are the highlights. Go for it if you‚Äôre looking for budget Bluetooth earphones. They are comfortable with good quality sound.
It's monstrous battery,5.0,"This earphone made me go crazy with its battery life. I am now going to charge its battery after two weeks since I bought it. So it reminded me to write a review. My usage is sometimes listening to music and mainly attaining calls, snd it has brought a convinient way to do so. Good product......."
Very happy with the purchase.,5.0,"Amazing headphones, got them at a steal price of 1100. Worth every rupee, the quality is immediately noticeable. I tried mivi thunderbeats and infinity from Harman before buying this. Not satisfied with their design."
Ok but not satisfied,2.0,Not satisfied as specified sound and bass is ok for using as I‚Äôm using Sony Bluetooth headset comparing to that it‚Äôs goodBut as Specified not compatible with Siri and google voice assistantAlthough having better performance inside the helmet while driving it will be better to useDon‚Äôt encourage this type of products for better
Not expected from a brand as renowned as Boat!!,1.0,"The product got dysfunctional after a few days of purchase. Registered a complaint regarding the same and they opened a ticket for me. The ticket took a lot of days to resolve and finally they sent me a replacement. However, the replacement has a major defect associated with it's charging port. The original boat USB does not fit into the port rendering the earphones as good as dysfunctional. Highly disappointed with the product and the service."
Ordered 255 pro+ but got 255 pro.Package seal was already broken & jus tapped back poorly.,1.0,"Battery problem within few months. The earphones got heated whenever i plug them for charging & after few days faced quick battery drain issue as well.Am giving 4 stars because of their replacement policy. They provide 1 year warranty period. So I raised a complaint in Boat website with the purchase invoice. They picked up my product, reviewed and replaced with a new one within 10 days. If it is a genuine fault, they are providing us with a new one, if it comes under warranty period"
Good for Bass,4.0,Bluetooth feature is having some issue. Its getting disconnected in between. Been using it now for 11 months. Works fine. Do not come out frequently during work out. Bass of music is the specialty of the product is what i felt.
Product that is worth of cost.,5.0,"Received it timely as promised by Amazon. I am writing this review after using for months. Good sound quality with better effects. Bluetooth reception,  very rarely you will get glitches that too during moving in the bikes. Very good feedback from the keys, good build quality, very easy to handle, suitable for workouts,  cycling and jogging etc., Totally,  it is worth of cost."
Best for the price,5.0,It is having good sound quality and it can connect to two devices at once so I can be working on my pc and if I receive a call I will get the call in my earbud and has great microphone best for zoom meeting and also for teaching
Good thing....,5.0,Product is perfect and boat service is pretty good... Im using this from almost past 11 months and it got damaged i went to boat website for replacement and yes i got replacement under warranty... Satisfaction brand and product.
Best Bluetooth Headphones in this budget but comfort could have been better..!!,5.0,"I would just say best Bluetooth headphones in this budget. I got it for around 1300 but you can get this around 999 in sales. Sound quality is good, battery life is decent, comfort is not that good because of bulkier earpieces, mainly if you loves to watch or listen  while going to sleep it gets uncomfortable. If you can bare with this drawback then these are good pair of headphones. Just go for it."
Worthy product,4.0,"A very good product in bluetooth headsets segment. Amazing sound quality, good balance of the weight.The bluetooth is good and can stay connected for a distance about 10 meters without wall, 3 meters with wall obstruction."
"Microphone is not working many time, Calling time Microphone Sound is low .",3.0,Good but calling time many problems face ..noise cancelling is not working many time .and many time is microphone is not workingcall karke baat karne somoy dosre phone par baat sonai toh deti hai lekin sound bohot kom hota hai ...isla microphone ka problem hga sayed nahi toh microphone quality ascha nahi haiWarranty card and Where warranty my product
Right bud stopped working for the second time abruptly.,2.0,"At the time I bought it in February this year, I gave it 5 stars because of its sound and style. But now I am changing it to 2 stars. Right Bud of this earphone stopped working suddenly 2 months back now even though I used it very carefully, I thought there would have been some mistake from my side. I got a replacement which took almost a month. Still no bad review from my side. But the Same Right bud stopped working again now even though I am using it carefully. So, decision to change my review."
Within one month the product is dead.,1.0,"T'he product is not as per my expectations, it got disconnect automatically in between (though it has enough battery life) and you have to establish the connection again. Sometimes it work and sometimes it don't.  In just 38 days the the product  has lost its life and now is completely dead."
"Bass, soundquality & Battery life",3.0,in comparison with my old earphones senhizer Cx which coast around 700‚Çπ has good sound quality .then this one Boat has focused on bass may be that is the reason of less sound quality if we talk about battery backup it last upto 5hour in full sound
Workout with free hands...,5.0,"Sound Quality- Awesome with great listening experience especially when you're working out.Noise cancellation- Fine, but could've been better.Moisture Wicking- Good enough to keep it unaffected.Charging Chord- Too small, may be made so because it's compatible with any charger and they just had to keep a dummy.Overall nice & useful as it clings to you through your workout session."
I am not satisfied from boat.,1.0,"I had heard a lot of praise from this company, but I am not satisfied with this company at all, I had bought a boat rocherz 255 from the boat company but it became useless within only 12 days when I sent it to the service center I got 15 to I got it back after 20 days and still it is not working properly."
Decent for the price,3.0,"noise cancellation is bad. mic captures all sounds, so while u are travelling it is difficult to converse.sound is good, but battery life is poor. runs max 3-4 hours on full charge."
Totally disappointed,1.0,"Totally disappointed with this product on amazon....No proper bluetooth connection..No noise cancellation...No battery backup...when my battery goes to 80, it doesn't work....only i can use this bluettoth from 100% to 80 %Since i lost my amazon packing cover, i couldn't exchange /return as well even though i have return duration.....‚òπÔ∏è"
Battery and one sided speaker issue,2.0,Nothing is in the bluetooth to like everything seems like a issue after 6 7 months.Battery was go down within few hours of full charged and audio isn't working in one sided .Don't know what the hell is this.
"Recommended for Quality Sound, Bass and no more extra Noise",5.0,I like the product. Good sound quality. Easy to handle. Hardly 1 hr charging is required to play sound with Boat Rockerz for the whole day. Worth buying. Bass Quality is superb. No extra noise while using the earphones.
"Fragile, not durable or long lasting",3.0,"Bought it in Oct 2019, used it regularly for just over 2 months before the cable broke, expected better durability from Boat brand, disappointing.Sound quality and battery backup is good, connectivity is quick and range is also good enough considering the price range of the device.Overall disappointed with the product."
"PATHETIC PRODUCT,Worthless>>",1.0,I have purchased this product recently and after limited use or just after 2th or 5th use i tried charging the headphones and it is not charging tried to write to customer case as the product is in warranty have failed to hear or didn't got any response regarding the same today i am writing this review after exculpating the issue 15 days ago still haven't received any revert
Better for Rough use,4.0,Its a good quality one. But don‚Äôt expect much noise cancelling feature (I would say nothing for noise cancelling) sound quality is good and the major advantage is its good for rough use. It will not get damaged easily. I am using this from last 3 months.After using this I bought one rocker 275. That have better sound quality but too delicate. This model is good for bike riders and rough using. This will not get much moisture wicking but the ear cushion is not much good for longer user. I am about change that now
Working with only one device,3.0,"First time paired with one phone it was working fine, later tried pairing with couple of other phones, not able to pair, don't know what's the issue."
Boat Rockers,4.0,"The quality of the product is really good, its value for money,its very comfortable to useI loved the magnet, the Battery life is also good the charging is fastAm happy with the product fuillfulls my requirements."
One Side earphone gets damaged. Very poor service at service centre.,1.0,Battery capacity and charging speed is good.But what's the use if we cannot use it after sometime.So many people were there at service centre .No solution. Only wastage of time money and effortPlease do not buy such cheap quality brand products
Overall good But some issues,3.0,"Sound quality is fine but dont buy this product because it has problem of falling again n again from the ear. Since the volume buttons are embedded on the wire itself it makes it heavy and the plugs dont fix in the ear for longer time, they tend to fall again n again."
stopped working left side after 6 months,3.0,"Sound quality great.wireless pairing instant.Charging easily lasts a day.charging time takes around 2 hours.Stopped working after 6 months,one side only working now.Not good,Boat.mic quality is average,depends on situation,can listen the conversation of a person sitting beside the caller in a bus,with extra detail."
Best quality Bass,5.0,Best quality bass ! Good quality materials used. As it does noise cancellation you'll need to talk little bit on higher tone...if you talk in low tone or whisper; another person on call won't hear you! It does support two device connects at the same time. Colour doesn't look as fresh as it looks in pictures. Would recommend to buy !
Good product..... but,4.0,"I bought this product.  I am using samsung galaxy A30.  The headphone is connected.  Sound quality is excellent but is often disconnected automatically.  When the screen is locked and unlocked, a small sound is heard.  replacement order given.  The boat was purchased because of its trust in the product and Amazon.  We believe the replacement product is good."
Recommended,5.0,Comfortable to use. Everytime connecting to Bluetooth is easy. Noise cancellation is much better than many other Bluetooth headphones out in the market. Battery charge lasts a long time.
Worst battery,1.0,"Battery backup is very low, getting discharged after usage of 1:30 Hrs of usage. I am using it for 15 days only."
Product is not working even after replacement,1.0,"This product is really ""Backwas"". I have replaced the product one time and even after getting new one safe problem occurred. Headphone neither switching on nor connecting to the phone. Replacement window already deemed. Company should not shell this type of product.... Or make the product with more concentration with good workers."
"One Side Stopped Working, it may be defective piece, But Sound Quality is Very Much Good",2.0,"I bought these earphones one month ago and today it's one side Stopped working, overall headphones are best at this price, sound quality is also very good, bass is very high which is very good, but it's built in quality is somewhat lowAs I said it's one side Stopped WorkingBut I claimed warranty and boat is now replacing me these earphones, hope the replacement should not also stop working"
Don't buy boat product,1.0,Don't by this Bluetooth headset service is very badI buy this headset 1 month r/s very very low soundMy eyerpineNo costumer service in Tamil and otherOnly English and HindService time 21 daysNo one help for costumerPlz don't buy boat product
Total wastage of money poor sound and NO RETURN POLICY,1.0,Total wastage of moneySound 0/10Quality 0/10Material 0/10Not comfortable size also is too long for neck and earphones are not adjustableAnd the worst part is you can not return the item once you purchased it you will be trapped total money gone to trash
Low battery life,1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, IT'S WASTE OF MONEY!!! This is the review for Rokerz 255 Pro. In the product description, they claim 10 hrs playback time once you charge it fully. But it doesn't go beyond 5hrs...Even I replaced this product but still facing same issue..."
I paid money for a good quality bluetooth but the replacement came with a low quality.,1.0,"Excellent Scam!!I paid money for a good quality bluetooth, total playback time is 8 hrs but when I give this bluetooth for replacement, it comes with low quality, total playback time is 6hrs, you can see this picture üëÜ. And it got worse in 1 week. But the replacement option is not showing there.ü§¨"
Useless product,2.0,"I like the product but if u go for this much expensive Bluetooth headphones and within six months one of the earpiece got bekar so it's seems useless for me... I don't wanna give it more than 2 star, bought for my husband as a birthday gift but within six months, he has to again buy another earphones so go for sasta 50rs product but not for this one"
Crystal Clear sound bluetooth speaker,5.0,Sound quality is - ExcellentNoise cancellation  is also GoodGetting Good Battery BackupBlue is my favorite colour hence went for Navy Blue.
Effective sound quality,5.0,Using from. Past 6 months. Won't found any default in product. I got delivery on time. Very effective sound quality. Charge for 1 hour and it will work for 6 to 8 hours a day. I used to charge daily as I am travelling daily in local  train for job so I require daily. Go. For it. Good product to have in your bag.
Boat Rockerz-Wastage of money,1.0,Got it replaced once. But didn't resolve the purpose. The boat Rockerz is definitely not worth the value. Noise cancellation is negligible and sound quality is also not as expected. Definitely not worth buying
"Worst. 2 hr battery, 5 feet range.",1.0,Most poor earphone ever.It will discharge in 2 hours of usagePoor range of just 5 feet. Audio will break even from one corner of room to other.Pathetic device should be taken off the sell list.
Low life span,1.0,"Bought this set end of October 19, it is majorly malfunctioning with many  drops in connectivity. For this price, the performance and life is very poor. There is no redress possible for online purchases so its money wasted. I would recommend go for another model/ brand. This is a let down. Sound quality and sound blocking features were very good but if product has such a short life then it is a major pain. look for better products."
Will stop working adter a 45 days,1.0,"I bought this because the earlier one same model which i owned, stopped working after about 2 months (right side sound gone and then fully gone), and now same happened to this piece in just 45 days."
Worst product and Worst service,1.0,"Worst product ,its not working after 4 months,me and my other 3 friends brought this all faced the same issue even after having the warrenty they are not replacing and boat customer service is waste they will not pick the or respond to the customer"
Worth buying in this price range rather than Chinese one,4.0,"Taking  price of the product is at Par.1) Sound quality is perfect.2) Bass quality is at Par.3) Noise cancellation perfect for a rider4) Taking calls are good, sometimes you hear wired sound disturbance but only in some calls of far end mic issues5) Taking price of the product worth buying either then Chinese one."
Waste of money,1.0,Useless... Just started giving Bluetooth connectivity issues in a month of usage. Waste of money!!! The product was collected by the boat people it reached the service center but no one picks up the phone even if u call continuously. No one reply to the mails. Now I don't know where the headset is and what are they upto as it's been more than 4days that it reached the service center. Pathetic n horrible customer care and useless company.dont know hw r they surviving.
DONT BUY THIS JUNK... WORST WORSTTTTTT ONE....,1.0,"Very worst i would say no customer support .... and frndz 1st of all it is not even 1% swet proof.Not working in 1 month bluetooth not connecting to my device.. better go for phillips, sony or samsung.... not worth.."
Nice at this price,5.0,"Decent according to price, sometimes causes trouble while connecting and also generates noise(this happens a few times after 3-4 months of use now it's working fine). It's been almost an year and working fine till now."
Value for money,5.0,After six months I have writting review excellence  build quality  nice sound with bass itcan survive in  accidental rain  battery backup is 6 hrs max but small minor it takes almost 90 min for charging over all good it can connect multiple devices that good thing superb product
Worst Service by Boat,1.0,"Product worked good for 8 months and then the left ear piece stopped working. Registered a complaint, the took the faulty product and it's been more than a month now I m still waiting for a replacement. Their phone is always unreachable. Ticket status shows Replacement approved since last 6 days but no update. Worst service. Do not buy this product."
There's No Support For Aptx & Noise Cancellation is So So..,1.0,My General Feeling After A Months Usage:1) Build Quality is Expected and Good For the price they're selling at.2) Battery Life Is Great and usb-c charging is a great feature .3) Noise Cancellation is iffy.4) No Support For Aptx on my pair. (Using S20 FE which supports Aptx).
Product is awesome... Package is worst,4.0,I couldn't apply for warranty......Product is good.... Wit awesome sound quality....The sound quality is above expectations...But.... The packing is damaged..... I don't know y.....The package is damaged worstly... Kindly look upon the package.... Plss
DO NOT THINK TWICE.... JUST BUY...,5.0,Close your eyes(skeptic eyes)... Scroll the page to buy now.... And check out..... Simple..... Has a battery back up of more than 8 hours if your use is judicious.... I have not chrged it ever since I bought it and this is after 2 days of purchase....
waiting for replacement,1.0,I purchased these headphone on 2nd may 2021 after 1and half month microphone stopped working i have claimed for warranty lets see how many days it will take to solve my problem.
product dead in less than 6 months,3.0,since last 2 days post charging blue light keeps on. it doesnt go of even when you turn the product off. also in last 1 day it has stopped charging and turning on. it is now dead. tried resetting etc.
Max volume came down in 3 days,4.0,I tested these on full volume on day one. It was too loud but crystal clear which met my expectations. But on day 3 that mox volume came down to a moderate level. I did read about the same in one ef the reviews but didn't expect it to happen so soon. Sounds and build quality is good
Worst Product ever Received,5.0,"Worst product I ever received because after doing power on it is automatically shutting off, first I thought it will be a minor problem but this problem I didn't face until now.Now the return window is also closed so how can I replace or return this product....Any Suggestions ??"
Worth buying,4.0,Great product with great sound quality and optimum bass. But in my personal opinion I found 1plus neckband far better mainly because boat rokerz 255 does not have sensors due to which it stays connected with the device even when it is stuck magnetically . Also the connectivity is very slow.
Constant shity rumble crackling sound when playing like its 1894,1.0,"Constant rumble crackling sound when playing like its 1894, buy the product if you want feel like you are in the history and enjoy the music with vynl cracks this is the perfect product.if the replace doesnt comes good then I have wasted my 1099.This was my first boat product and thanks boat, you suck."
Voice lagging during pubg,3.0,The problem i am facing is with connectivity and its voice lagging during any games especially pubg....there is vooce lagging all the time and you can't play pubg wearing these....also time to time while Playing video signal lags and there is some hummingbsound for 20-30 seconds
Best,5.0,"I like sound quality and handling  and best of best bettry back up 1 time chage and 3 day use it's best for bettry,but only some time difficult erarberd are not feet properly and it's little big only this issue but overall best product"
Poor Bluetooth Range.,3.0,If only this the Bluetooth range was little better this would have been an excellent product.I use thus headphone while running. When I kept my phone on zipped pocket on the back of my track I would often loose connectivity. I had to keep my phone either on my hand or front pocket which was quite inconvenient. I returned the first one but still same problem withbthe second one.I also wish they‚Äôd provide a case for safekeeping.
One of speaker stopped working,1.0,"I am using this headphone rarely and even though less usage, one of the speakers is not working. I am not satisfied with the quality of the headphone.I bought this considering my other Boat headphones which were great. But with this headphone problem, I might think before buying again Boat headphones."
Best product best price,5.0,I am loving the product. It's totally a worthy product in such a best price. It's gets fully charged in 1.5 hrs and as it's new it is currently working for 8 hrs. I can connect my mobile and laptop both at the same time.
Bad in noise cancellation while on call,1.0,Generally i don't write any review but this it's necessary to write the review of this product. Headphone having noise issue for your call listener as they hear all the noise around you in very loud volume and unable to understand what you are talking on call. This headphone is goo for music and not for call.I hope my review helps other to choice the correct headphone for user.
Disappointed,2.0,Sound quality is good but there's lot of disturbance while playing music. Sounds like  music is buffering due to slow internet connection even though I am playing tracks which are saved in my phone. When they are saying it's has Qualcomm technology for better connectivity then I don't expect this.Another issue is battery drains too fast. If I charge fully in the morning then I need to charge in the afternoon coz it's switched off.I have given the 2 stars for the sound quality only otherwise it's not much worth.
Audio Latency,1.0,While playing game there is 1 second delay in the audio.Latency of 1 second while playing game
Background noise cancellation doesn't exist,4.0,"Background noise cancellation doesn't exist in this peace, while on call other person cam clearly hear everything in background even a dog barking outside your home üòÇ, even background is to loud, sometimes other person is not able to hear my voice bcoz of background noise. Except everything works great it's been 6 months since i started using it. Thankyou."
Best in the category (Comparison with MI basic wireless earphones),5.0,"I purchased two wireless earphones simultaneously, Boat RockerZ 255 and MI basic wireless earphones. After using both for a week, I found that:1. Boat RockerZ 255 is comparatively higher on bass and sound quality.2. MI has a better battery longevity.3. Boat RockerZ has a more sturdy built.4. MI is easier and much lighter to move around with.I use either as per my need."
Headache headphones with ear pain,3.0,"This is not upto the mark... not value for money... 1599Rs is too much for its quality, because it gives headache in 30min of use, and it gives ear pain, not at all user friendly very rough headphones with so much of discomfortness, worth for 1000rs not worth for 1599rs, if u gonna use for more than 1 hr a day... don't buy this product. Very disappointed..."
Defective product,1.0,It has stop working after 3 months of purchase Worst Customer Service provided by boat company. Will Stop buying their product and will suggest friends & relatives to not buy Boat Products. I have called them several times and has not been responded either through mail or phone call. Once again I will say worst product ever.
The best,5.0,Excellent product from boat. As expectedThe sound quality is very good and the noice cancellation works very good easy to handle and best earphones for the price.The battery comes for 6 to 7 hours.Best choice.
Not for deep bass lovers,4.0,Overall good product for a person who is not into deep bass it's got a quite beat but not sufficient to pump u upIt has sufficient low latency to play normal games even on pcCall quality is also good not badThumbs up for the fast chargingBad thing is it disconnects some times during call or suddenly some one calls u when ur on another call
It's an ok product for that price,3.0,It's not at all good for gamingI don't suggest it for gamingSound quality is better but not bestBut the battery life very goodAnd there is some disturbance while we are in traffic. I think it is not that much perfect when youare in traffic or on roads.The next day i return this product
Overall good at discount price,4.0,Quality is good when play music but when it comes to calling it is ok ok.battry back up is good but buttons feels cheap. Over all ok in 799/-  in sale.Only buy durring sale other wise you should go for another option. One more thing that no vibration for calling so you have to all time put it in your ear.
Doesnt last for long,3.0,"Had been good for one and half years in all aspects until on a fine morning, one ear bud stoppes working suddenly. And in less than a week, the other one too!! Sad part is all thos happened just a few months after the warantee expired."
Very bad quality no suggestion to buy.,1.0,Very bad quality no suggestion to buy.No connectivity if you are connect to one device delay in sounds after connection.To much longer not in used to headphones.
Great pairüòÇüòÅ,4.0,I am a gym person.Sweat no issue.It's just that while skipping it tends toGo here and there and same is the issue with bench press.Though headphones are well built but tend to move here and there if u workout rigrously.Sound- just for bass loversNoise cancellation- all most okay but not good as SennheiserMoisture you won't find any issuesShould you buy it?Yes at this price rangeYour getting best of every feature so it doesn't hurt much
Very pathetic product with more oathetic service,2.0,"Very pathetic quality of product. I bought it in february and and it developed problems in 2months only. No sound in both the speakers, very much disappointed. Now when I want to claim the warranty, there is no link to place my claim. When i tried it from web, they registered the complain but asking me to come to thier service center. Pathetic. Plaese dont buy this product otherwise you wil feel cheated."
Not worth.. Highly uprated,1.0,After using it for 4 weeks my whole experience has changed the way I look at boat productsIt is not good for talk back/calls and after few weeks you can hear voice cuts happening too
Like Bass and sound quality,5.0,I really like this boat rokerz 255 pro. sound was super.  heavy Bass make for bass lovers . battery life is good continuously listing music get 6 to 7 hours playback depending on your music volume.design and build quality nice looks like stylish. comfortable fiting.

Nice product,4.0,"Sound quality is good and also the bass. I was expecting a little more sound clarity. Superb noise cancellation. But not good for gaming. Due to wireless technology, there's a slight lag between gameplay and the sound effects. Otherwise very good product."
Worst Quality by the seller dont buy this,1.0,"it will work fine only for few days after that . product will stop responding to connect with  bluetooth and when you will complain they will say your mobile have the problem and i am using iphone XS  ,,and it is so cheap quality . i think its from chinese worst cheap quality they are selling (beware of Corona)also see the picture . how worst this is."
Battery life is excellent,5.0,This is the headphone which i was looking for i charge it just for 20mins and it runs 4hrs continously i really like its build quality its very durable and is also provided with google assistant which makes it easier to use and finally the sound quality is dope i bet u cant get a headphone like this at this price dont think a lot just buy itüòä
I would have given 1 star if it didn't have suprisingly good battery life,3.0,"they are bad , their design is flawed , with that extra weight of three buttons seperately on the wire they cant be used for gym or runningbut man-o-man their battery is freaking great , they can easily last for 4-5 days for me , after around 7-8 hours usage each day ..."
Important thing to know,5.0,"Basically product is awesome .but don't buy this product in 1500.just put this product in cart and wait to price low.when any offer come and price till 999 ,then buy it .it is good in this price . although it is good product . important note your first check boat service center in your city before buying if it get damaged within one year you can go to boat service center and then your product maybe replace ya correct on that's place .best of luck."
Value for money,4.0,"Bought it from Great Indian Festival for 999 rs. Battery is superb, works perfectly as promised. Sound quality and noise cancelation are bit on the lower side of average but can't complain it on that price. Magnets are weak and tend to get loose when even running very slowly. But overall a great product.üëç"
Not that good,3.0,It's just okay product....not satisfied with performance....Bluetooth range is very less...around 3meters....sound n mic quality is good...but volume is less
Good quality,3.0,"It's okay kind of product, bass and sound quality is okay. Product is good but concern . How product price vary every day . One day 899 and other day 999 with same vendor apprio which is Amazon's subsidiary. What kind of joke Amazon is cracking."
Review,5.0,Depends upon on your luckI am lucky enough to get genuine product.Once u plug it into your ears u cant hear anything in the outside environment without even playing the song .Ratings:Bass- 10/10Treble-9/10Noise cancellation -10/10Design - 9/10
NO BASS crackling sound only,1.0,I have also read the reviews before buying but what we demand a pure and real sound is really not present in it very disappointed ....it has no bass and it gives crackling sound....as like the sound of 20 rupees mobile that we played during childhood (chal chhaiya chhaiya) ... This review will work for you the best.
Best ever buy of headphones üéß,5.0,"Very nice neck band at price 1099‚Çπ ,nice noise cancellation and bass also satisfactory , battery backup very good ."
Awesome | Cheap | Long Lasting,4.0,Pros:1. Superb sound quality considering that it's a wireless earphones2. Comfortable to wear3. Bass quality is also nice4. Battery backup is very good5. Noice cancellation is pretty good tooCons:1. Sometimes Bluetooth connectivity fluctuates and it disconnects/reconnects automatically2. Cannot wear while Jogging unless you find a way to stick them to one place. While running it tends to bounce off and eventually drops off from your ears
Useless battery life. False claims of good battery backup,1.0,Useless battery life. I do not know if I received a defective product but standby battery doest last for more than 12 hours and usage battery life may not be more than 2 hours.
Don't buy this,1.0,"This is a stupid product, I feel they have cheated by sending fake copy product, it worked only for 2 weeks, and now the sound is unclear and very low, I'm unable replace now, service centre is in Mumbai, how can I go from chennai to Mumbai?? Instead buy some good brand like Samsung level u, amazon pls tell how to use the warranty and repair or replace it"
Please do not buy,1.0,Please do not buy this product. Please go for any other productBattery last for 1 hour maximum. (100% to 20% in 1 hour)Sound quality is okay (not even good)Worst part is the size of the belt is longer than needed and look like cheap product. Very badI don't how this product get 3.9 rating.
Go for it!!!!!,4.0,"Awesome battery life really is awesome  continuously u can use this for 8 hours at least üòçNow bass quality is 9/10Mids 8/10Highs 10/10!!!Charging is not that fast but it is mediumIt is very good do'nt take the cheap version of it spend a ‚Çπ100 more on this it will surely be worth it so now just go for it, I bought it for ‚Çπ1100"
Work up boAt..!!!!,1.0,Worst product i have ever bought guess what started giving issues right after the replacement duration is over and ofently best reviews were withing 2-3 days this review is after 15 days of usage. This buletooth earphones gets disconnected automatically after every 2 mins (with one plus 6t & Honor holly 3) i would recommend not to buy this product there's various different Bluetooth earphones which you can look for at this price range based on my personal experience i do not suggest it to any one.
Facing a Bug,5.0,Overall The Product is best at a price below 1000 RS.The ear supporters slide on the surface of earphones which make it comfortable (so it could fit in every ear) but annoying at the same time(earphone feels loose and get out of ear).Sometimes when you connect it after any pre connected device the volume doesn't vary to maximum as I need to reconnect it.(It could be a case with my phone only(Lenovo K8 Note) but worth to mention the fact.
Poor noise cancellation,3.0,The product is on mark with the quality on this price but the one thing which completely disgrgards all this is the notice cancellation.The recipient always complaints about how the background noise is much louder than my own voice.Also for you to be clear on the other side you have to be loud enough to attract unnecessary attention which makes a mess many times.
Honest opinion,4.0,"Honest opinionSound 9/10Battery 9/10Bass 8/10Built 8/10However, there is one issue.Whenever you turn on the Hotspot for data sharing or others, it fluctuates the sound (call, music, games, etc).Worth buying."
Best at its price,5.0,"Bought it at ‚Çπ999 during sale.Probably the best at its price, boAt never upsets you with their product.After full charge continuous music can be played for 7-7.5 hours.Been 4months and no issues, just a great product.Edit :Been more than a year now, and still works great. Probably the coolest bluetooth earphone at this price range !"
"Cheap products , company was fraud with costumer.s",1.0,Its sound quality is adorable. overall it was good but just for 2 weeks after that it stopped working and since then it never powered on again. I am claiming for warrenty and it is still undergoing.
Amazing,4.0,Personally These product was amazing. I am using this for 6 months. Its perfectly working. The sound quality was amazing and the power packup was also too good. I recommend this product for the consumer. May be its my luck dont scold me when it doesnt suits for you
For Light weight lovers... Not good for base and  callers. Worst for calling.,2.0,"Pros:- long life battery, light weight is highlight, good quality,Cons :- ear paining (big sized round moulded ear piece), neck band and wire length is too high(irritating)(compare 335), passive noise cancellation, caller can't get our voice clearly while calling (compare with rockerz 335),"
It's Bluetooth connectivity has become very poor aNd also  when it is on no Green light appears.,1.0,My rocekrz 225 pro earphones stopped working in around 1 months. I contacted boAt customer service and they told me to visit the nearest service center which was far away from my place.It's Bluetooth connectivity has become poor. Nd when I switched it on there is no Apperance of green light. When I tried to connect my device it failed. I am really very worried for this device. I want to replace it.
A good option for gifting. Value for money,5.0,"Gifted this to my fiancee. A good option for gifting your man who is sasta, majboot, tikaau and likes to listen to songs in full blast. This good experience may however be backed by him shouting out misheard lyrics out in public, but that's his default setting which is amplified by a good product."
Best Quality,4.0,The sound quality of this product is very good but the coverage area of the signal is not I expected. If your phone is in one room and your headset is in another room then the signal is somewhat losses. Noise cancellation is very good.
"One side stopped working,Mic issue and Bluetooth range problem",2.0,"It's sound n noise cancellation is good , Battery Backup is good too. But after using for 1-2 month it one side shut down suddenly n also the caller in front can't hear your voice it's mic is below average. Also I faced Bluetooth range problem when I connect it to my phone and keep my phone in my pocket it just disconnect....I have place a replacement. So let's see"
Cool product,4.0,"After using this for more than one month, it can be said that, the product is simply fabulous. But battery downs rapidly after use, sometimes from 80% to 20%. Though it lasts for sufficient times. I got it for 999/- , so for me it is perfect in this price range."
Worth buying!!,4.0,boAt Rockerz 255 pro‚úì Good sound quality‚úì Very Comfortable earbuds‚úì Good product quality‚úì Fine noise cancellationThe mic could have been better. Mostly the person on the other side has difficulty in hearing what we speak. This can be solved if we slightly hold mic towards mouth when we speak!!
DON'T BUY BOAT EARPHONE,1.0,"DON'T BUY EARPHONES FROM BOATAfter 6,7 months it starts to show prblms like left earphone defect, charging prblm n all and again after 5 mnths suddenly the left side stopped working and got ut replaced as it was under warranty but the new product that i got also stopped working after 2 mnths .. Not pretty reliable. The bass is not that goodBetter go with some good quality earphones like Oneplus .."
Good quality,4.0,Good product in minimum Cost. I use it for My smartphone and Laptop as well...I didn't face any problems with it and after all its an electronic product so we can't blame it..just keep enjoying music.
Not recommended,2.0,"Well, when u listening to the music it's good. However when u r on a call, the noise from my side keeps disturbing the other person on the line. It catches noise a lot.Disappointed plus there was not refund option for this item on Amazon which caused me money loss on this stupid product."
Doubt,3.0,Over all performance is fine bt doubt about authenticity as it's full name is not boAt rockerz as it is with other original earphones. Not sure what is the reason for the change of name. Some say those are not original ones.
Boat rockerz... just rocking it ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è,4.0,"Really loved the product.. the Bluetooth connectivity is just too good.. it easily connects with any android or iOS devices.. sound quality is a different level.. feels like you are in a theatre.the pricing is so reasonable. Having such a quality at such a price is something we don‚Äôt get easily.customer service is also very good. I had some issues with my device , I called the customer service and their service is was very fast."
Didn't expect poor Bass quality from BAot.,3.0,"if your music lover, this not for you.Very low Bass effect.can chose better one with this price range."
Needs improvement,2.0,"It's noise cancellation, bluetooth connectivity and sound quality is good but it has lots of issue with battery. It's battery after charge will go from 60 to 0 within few minutes"
Good Product Boat Rockerz,5.0,"Hello Everyone,I am very thankful to Boat company to make Good Quality Bluetooth headphones in a medium Prices. This product is very awesome and easily compatible and a good look and wear. I also thank Amazon company for delivering inaccurate time. I am thanking Boat and Amazon Company to Provide me a Good and Medium Price.Thank you,Rishi Jain"
Good Product...,5.0,Superb quality. Must buy...Good sound.Good Plastic buttonsValue for money..Mumbai Indianüòò
Like@999,4.0,"Nice headphones but not totally noise cancellation.base is gud.battery stands arround 8-9 hr.overall it is gud deal @999 ,bcz a gud color earphone is arround @2500-@3000 like sony, Skullcandy,and JBL brands...battery is equally works so I think it is great deal in this price section"
Sounds good but not reliable!,2.0,"Bass and the audio quality is really comparable to big brands. However, durability is a concern. The first pair I had had some issues with right earphones. The replacement had issues of voice breakage. Sooner or later, the boat sinks... I went for JBL Endurance Run BT."
Sound quality a little disappointing,3.0,"Sound is okay average quality clearity, bass is good,Durable and battery also goodIf you want better sound quality go for boult process lot better or even boat triple drivers"
Bad sound quality,2.0,Bluetooth connectivity was nice but sound quality is the only reason why I didn't liked these and had to return. I don't know what's wrong with the sound quality it just a pain to my head even if I am using them for just minimal calls.
Worth the money,4.0,A good product for a cheap price. If your looking for a cheap Bluetooth earphones with a decent sound quality go for it. The comfort of also good. Overall worth the money
Poor battery backup and cheap sound,2.0,Sound quality is not up to the mark as claimed by boat. I have mi earphones but they have much better sound in the same range. Also battery backup is vry poor. It can only run upto 3 hours after full charging while watching movie. This is not acceptable.
Good sound quality but low  battery life.,4.0,I bought it for 999. Sound quality is really good and good grip on-ear. the battery life is approx 2 hour. Earphones quality is good with strong magnetic lock... Straps is good quality and the earphones wires are too good... Buttons quality is good.overall a good earphone in under 1000.
Good Product,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†nice quality.. charging is fast, music quality nice, connects with two devices. call quality is good. Sometimes give connectivity issues."
"Depends , not all products are bad but some products company default",1.0,"After 2 months of use , its right side is not working, i hope boat will exchange itCheck it ,if its less audible then other of your earphones ( any brand , may be wired or wireless ) return it"
Not a great experience,3.0,"It is not better than Boat rockerz 255.Pro has some extra bass for music lovers and fast charging.Person next to me could hear everything I was listening, that is not good. I don‚Äôt want others to know what I am listening or whom I am talking. Mic isn‚Äôt that great either. I had to keep my mouth really close to mic for proper conversation."
Stopped working after one year.,1.0,Led stopped working just after 4 months. Bluetooth stopped working after one year . Will never recommend or buy boat products . Fooling people in the name of make a in India.
Good bass. Distance 10mtr definitely not.,3.0,"Writing this review after one month usage.Product is meant for people who prefer good bass. Sound quality starts dropping once u move away from object let it be like 4-5 meters too initial it was better. As it takes into consideration your body deflection ,and sound of a person talking is like he is in water.battery life is good.sound quality is better as i grabbed it for discount at 1200/‚Çπ.Actually would give 3.5 üåü"
Battery life long lasting iam impressed,5.0,Super fast chargeing 1 week batterylifeüîãBass quality- awesome ‚úÖ best cheepest earphone1500 underüî•
Read this before buying,3.0,"The sound quality was fine but not worth the price. Most of the time, the noise cancellation didn't work and the worst part is that they broke within a year. I bought two earphones (one black and the other red) both were working fine one night and stopped working the next morning. Kinda makes you question the build quality. If you're looking for value for money than these are not for you."
Awesome for the price range,5.0,"It has truly surpassed my expectation. The design and build quality is amazing. Bluetooth range is amazing. it can be simultaneously connected with two devices and it connects really fast. Battery lasts almost 6-7 hrs with medium volume. Sound quality is great for the price range I would say. You must not expect the quality of same priced wired earphone but that being said, this one is not too far behind. I absolutely loved this earphone. I got it for ‚Çπ999 which makes it a must buy at this price."
This will work only for one year,3.0,"Writing this review after using for one year. I bought two piece and one was worked till 11 months and another till one year, and after that one side stopped working in both the earphone. Customer service are also not responding."
Received used product,1.0,The product I received was a used one. The sound quality s very bad..  I had to keep the maximum sound in both my mobile and Bluetooth device.  When plugged into hears and wearing helmet it gives a mild pain..  Waste of money...
Disappointed with Product delivered with having Battery Issue,3.0,"Got this product immediately next day delivery but Product is not up to the mark.I don't think so its genuine one, gives battery issue. After getting switched off have charged 15 mints and it shows 100% charged and after 10 mints it shows 80%I have played only half an hour for 2 days and it gets switched off. Very disappointed"
Buy but be careful,5.0,after 5 month  one side of my earphones is not working so I sent that piece back for replacement originally it was neon colour but after replacement I I received complete black piece. The piece has keys on its left side and battery on right (faulty manufacturing). Overall sound quality noise cancellation is gr8
Read it before buy this product,4.0,Giving my review after using it for more than a month.first thing I dislike about this product is it give me slight ache in ears so I can't use it for more than an hour . Bettery backup is good but after 20% charge remaining it is hard to put on ears . Bass quality is somehow good . Overall not worthy to buy it .
Good product.,4.0,Overall a good bluetooth earphone. Sound is good. A little more treeble sound could have added a star to the product. Still a better choice to go for and enjoy. Expectations were more but not unhappy too.
Not good ear phone for long use,3.0,The ear phone is not good for long use. Due to bad shape of  earbuds ears pain a lot. Sound quality though good due to the main problem of earbuds I  prefer to give 3 star to the product
Nice product with best audio quality,5.0,I like the BoAt products as quality is as expected in that reasonable price range. Audio quality is great.Pros:Quality of output.Base is satisfactory.Battery is above average.Cons:No cons observed but vibration alert on calls should be added in this model.
Best affordable earphone and big battery üîãbackup,5.0,One of the best bluetooth earphones and having backup og 38 hours with 60% volume voice and sound quality goodBut noise cancelation was not gooodOverall good under 1499
Don't Buy [ people will not hear you ],1.0,for listning audio is good.But taking call from this headset is pathetic.. people won't be able to hear you.. [ break of voice]
PRETTY GOOD,3.0,"Pretty good build. I like the design more than anything. Sound quality is fine. At times, the Bluetooth pairing doesn't work properly. That's my only complaint."
Buy only if you need it for one year or less. It'll be dead in that time.,2.0,"Dead in less than one year! Not charging - no response - like it's customer service. Although sound quality and bluetooth connectivity is good enough, it's of no use if it stops working in less than a year. The company reared its head in the last few years though aggressive marketing push. but it could not create products which meets good standards. The customer service is not responsive at all."
Connectivity issue.,1.0,"There is connectivity issue while i am using this headphones every 2 to 3 minutes it was disconnected and reconnected automatically.Sound quality,noise cancellation,bass quality is very imperassive but unfortunately due to connectivity issue. I am returning this product to amazon."
Totally disappointed with only replacement policy!!!,1.0,The length of the wire is too long and it's quite inconvenient while it's not plugged into the ears! And there is no return.yiu have to live with what you have got.thwre is only replacement with the same model of same brand allowed.thats unfortunate.Iam totally disappointed.how can I predict the feel of the wire length before ordering and tried testing it once?!
Bluetooth connectivity and battery backup,4.0,Bluetooth connection stability this device connects instantly but while jogging work out or on the moving condition sometimes there is audio delay interruption which is unpredictable sometimes. If I'm using it with the phone in front of me it's awesome but if you want to enjoy music on the move or jogging etc this device will dissappoint you.The battery% fluctuated.. It means at the time connection battery level was 50/60% after using it for 15/20 min in medium volume the battery gets down ivr response battery low and indicator goes totally red.
"Gud Product, Great Price",5.0,"ITs a gud product, if you manage to get it at a very gud price, i did during the Diwali sale, the sound is gud and the features are gud also..Recommended."
Need refund,3.0,One of the 2 I bought is not functioning. I need refund for this. I would like to return it.I know boat has good reviews. But one the product is not functioning. Bluetooth connection and battery life are poor. I'm not getting battery life even for 1hour.Kindly please help me. I don't want this product. It's been only 20days I brought
Boat rockers not so useful,3.0,Fashionable but not very useful. There is noise when connected to Windows 10 Bluetooth. This has to be repeatedly recharged frequently.
Nice product in such a price,4.0,I've been using this for a week and so far I've no complaints.The battery life is quite good. I can go for days without charging. Love the noise cancellation.It doesn't auto connect tho. And as soon as the magnetic earbuds connect it still doesn't switch off instantly. So might want to look into thatBut otherwise awesome product
bad product,1.0,one side of the year phone was damaged within a year. It all happened when i have not been using it for long period. And when I tried to contact the call centre nobody pickup the phone (during lockdown). seriously i haven‚Äôt received any message email or any call to tell me what to do. now warranty period is over and it is now a trash for me.
BAD CALLING EXPERIENCE AND NO RETURN OPTION,1.0,After using it for around 4 months I can guarantee it is not worth the money the baground noise disturbs calls so much. Only purpose which this solves is for music or video. NOT FOR CALLS. Also you can not return it after you buy it only replacement is available.
Solid bluetooth earphone with great sound quality and battery,5.0,"Design, comfort and sound quality is excellent. Haven't used it much for a solid battery review but it holds up well for near continuous use for 1.5 days before I charge it. It might last longer than this but I haven't got the opportunity to check yet."
Let me tell you very frank...,2.0,"Let me tell you very frank bass is quite good not great, connectivity is worst, battery is average, expectations is high for my side as per brand but its response totally fail , disappointed me.last but not the least when i open the parcel seal is open  and box packaging in parcel is damage."
Useless,1.0,Just loud noise. Not even near to JBL. Bluetooth looses connection if kept In pocket while walking. Cannot be flawless connected to BT while jogging. Useless
one side headphone is stopped working after 4 months and voice quality is not good,1.0,"I have used boats product earlier so I have ordered this bass quality is just ok ok as compared to wired version, batterywill last for 4 hours and take 1 hrs to charge. if you are looking for whatsapp call then don't go for it.quality over call is not good voice is very low"
Good but gives heart attack,4.0,Its a really good earphone and has amazing quality but after the 14 to 15 days i brought it it had this problem with one side sound being super low. Idk what created the problem but it surely scared the hell out of me as i thought it was bad product but it worked completely fine after an hour or so.
Can be better sound quality and backup,3.0,I expected beter sound quality from boat which is 1st interms of sales but it is quite average and battery backup is 5 hours and charging time is 3 hours which is not suitable for regular users.
No regrets,4.0,"This is my first time using a wireless earphone and I tell you I'm impressed with Boat. From the super bass to the controls and battery, worth every penny. Just one downside, I think the indicator is not very much visible and sometimes have to strain to see if the charging is full or not."
Worst product,2.0,Worst product. First Time I bought this boat company product and I trap.This product is working with laptop so I made a replacement request but after 2 days this is also not working with laptop.Quality standards are poor in Boat.Now I am looking for refund.
Beginner friendly,4.0,Everything is nice about this one just the size is too big for women I guess. Using it for 4 months and doing great.
Ok type product,3.0,I brought this during sale @999. Can say worth the money with few flaws ofcourse.Connecting it to 2 device shows issue. Sometimes connectivity is not stable.Battery life is considerably good.Sound quality is also good.
"Buy if you like ""cool"" but not quality",3.0,Earphone sound quality - 2.5/5 (Much worse than a cheap wired earphone)Microphone quality - 1/5 (Sound keeps breaking and no noise cancellation)Coolness factor - 5/5 (Nice looking and wireless)
Best in Budget,5.0,Sound quality is quite good when listening music in bass and also in high and lowsBuild quality shuld be more betterFast charging is marvelous it gives 100% charging in 10 minutes when your device is 50% chargedBattery could be better means it could be with capacity 10-12 hours‡§á‡§∏ ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§≤‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§á‡§∏‡§∏‡•á ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§Ç‡§™‡§®‡•Ä ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§¶‡•á ‡§∏‡§ï‡§§‡•Ä‡•§‡•§

Defective piece...easily and convenient refund provided by amazon,5.0,Sound quality and everything is great at the price point.Just I received a defective pieces.but Amazon refunded me and the service provided by Amazon was quick and convenient.
Don't buy,1.0,"Some time it will reconect by itselfFor gaming üéÆ never buy, found a sound delay problem for 0.50 second, if you think it's ok for gaming I suggest not to buy, because gamers understand the second of late will be whatGood packing, nice ear plugs and charge in one hour but waste of sound quality"
Good earphones for the price.,5.0,You get what you paid for! Got at 1499. Ordered another one in my family but at 1999! Demand is like that! Waiting for it.
Nice and Value for money earphones,4.0,Value for money. I got it for 1.5k the sound quality is decent...with mid level bass and treble...good for playing games...answering calls...and occasional music..but the Bluetooth range gets affected if we move away more than 8-9 feet.
Defective product,2.0,"It is one of the worst product that I purchased ever. The product has been damaged within few days. After lodging a complaint for its replacement, the item has been replaced after one month. Again within few days the same defect occurs. The sound output of the right portion is totally off."
Stopped working. Exchanged item too didn't work.,1.0,Please be careful. This one stopped working in a few months. I exchanged it with BOAT on their official website. I did receive another one. But it stopped working exactly after one week. This is very disappointing.
It stopped working from 23rd right after deadline to return the product expired.,1.0,"The headphone stopped working after a few days of use. It is not showing any lights, however I charge it.Feeling cheated"

WORST PRODUCT,1.0,"Worst Product I have ever come across.Within 10 days of usage, I know it's a short time. However, after using it continuously, I would strongly recommend NOT to go with this product. They are churning number in volumes for mass market and manufacture lowest quality earphone.Last night, I have kept for charge for whole night and it could charge only upto 40% and within next 5 mins the battery got completely drained."
Value for money product,4.0,Decent product with Fast charging facility.Sound quality good.Bass little bit higher side.Battery backup up to 5.30hNoise cancellation good
"Do not buy! I repeat ""DO NOT BUY""",1.0,Worst headset ever bought. 100% battery doesn't even last for 4 hrs. And that sucks. Sound and bass is good. But not at all satisfied with battery backup wastage of money.
Worst product ever from boat.,1.0,"This is the worst product I jave ever purchased from a branded company like boat, the sound quality is okay if not woret but dont expect anything like noise cancellation or bass quality. When you use the headphone in public then you forget that your voice will reach the other person except the sound around you."
Being a PRO DJ - Go for it ! üéß,3.0,1st of all.. Good delivery after 4 days by amazon.Sound quality is superb. üëåüèªBassline is mind blowing without distortion.Highs are mid average..Mids are ok.VOLUME level is low.. I have to tweak to almost 95% for clarity..WHY there is a SOUND DELAY when playing Games and VIDEOS ?As a Pro DJ good BT earphones in this price compared to jbl .Con's: no pouch provided . cable is quite tangling.MUST BUY for BASS lovers.
Good headphones but not the best üëçüíØ,4.0,"Build quality is, and it's light weight, flexible , but my only concern was it's audio quality wasn't better than my jbl csoo1 it was very smooth voice as compared to boat.. But next time I'll surely buy jbl products just for the fine tuning of sound and melody"
OK OK ear phones,1.0,I have bought it 4months back. All of a sudden it stopped working. It could connect to the device but no output...neither media nor calls. Even I could not hear the switching on voice. Now I checking for return policy
Quality product,5.0,Overall good product...Base and sound quality is awesome. Noise cancellation is okay...You can increase the base by exchanging the medium ear buds with larger ear buds which comes along with the package...Earpanels consists of magnets behind them which is pretty good... Highly satisfied with this product...Would recommend others to buy it...But the problem with the package was that I ordered for neon colour and I got black colour. ..I don't know why...
A Great Deal !,5.0,"Pros:1.Easy to wear, Fits well in ears2.Noise cancellation is good.3.Sound Quality is better.4.Battery life is great.5.Available at reasonable price.Cons:1.Bass could have been better2.Look is not so good as wire is bit long in front."
Bad performance,2.0,Poor qualityNo noise cancellationPoor quality of bass and soundLow quality and high priceOver all bad performance
Excellent,5.0,Really good thing in this price range. Have been using it since long time now. Sound quality is really very good also it can be used during light workout. Battery generally lasts upto 6-8 hours if you continuously use it for music or video. Go for it.
Quality is not upto the mark,2.0,"Fitting is not good, after some time earbuds will start to give pain,. Not recommanding for log duration usages."
Average product,3.0,Avrage productBut packaging is very bad box on use paper tap the tap is esly open and stickMy item is missingI complained about then i get second time this .
very bad for calling purposes,5.0,everything is fine with the earphones even the durability is so good i'm using it from almost one year buth their is a bigg issue call quality is very bad other person will only listen to background noises
Not made for running.,3.0,"The sound quality, no doubt is good for the price range. But its usage on the track is limited, or should I say, ZERO. If you're thinking you can wear these while you jogging sessions, forget about it. They just keep jumping from one place to another.Although, who am I blaming? I should have known better."
Amazing product,5.0,This is a good buy at a discounted price. Noise cancellation is awesome and you might have to struggle a bit to adjust it in the ear. Dont use for a long time because it starts paining. The design of the ear plug needs some improvement to allow longer usage.
Superb üëåüëå,4.0,Nice & battary backup is superb in full charge he gives 3 days battary backup in this price ‚Çπ1399 this product is awesome üëç
God bass and sound bad mic and battery,3.0,All very nice but not good for talking in call. Mic quality not good other person complaint to low sound.ProNice bassNice sound qualityEasy cinnectivtyConsMic qualityBattery

  ¬†1.Base is just awesome üî•üî•.2.Dual pairing features is also there to find out.3. Nice noise cancellation"
Pathetic or no noise cancelling in phone calls,2.0,Bought this earphones few days back. Average sound quality and very pathetic in noise cancellation. Noise beyond few meters catch like they are within few inches of mic. Don‚Äôt buy if you are looking for noise cancelling earphones. Bluetooth connection hampers even if you put mobile in left pocket.

No Noise Cancelation!,3.0,"It doesn't support noise cancelation. The person on the other end will hear the surrounding's noise more than yours and in a closed cabin, it will echo. Not recommended for calls. But for hearing songs, a great product!"
Poor sound quality.,2.0,Sound coming off these seem imbalanced. The vocals seem to be in the background and the instruments in the foreground. Also can't run or jog wearing these as the part with the buttons keep hitting your collar bone.

Extremely disappointed kindly help.
Great product specially for meetings and calls,5.0,"Great battery backup, nice quality of sound and amazing noise cancellation during during calls.. not so good for wearing long times.. but 4-5 hours you van wear comfortably.. the best part is the noise cancellation.."
Humongous battery life.,5.0,"Although battery backup is not only good but excellent, if you are going for gr8 bass or sound quality than you will be disappointed, because it has average sound quality.  But battery back up is far far better than other products within this budget."
faulty product delivered,1.0,"when i recived nackband , charging cable not work, just in week left side sound not coming, faulty product delivered to me & for warranty call log its divert & visit to service center, service center is 15 km far from my house & i mailed to boat but 2 days passed but still no respond."
all is perfect but I am here to tell about some cons,4.0,1 When I stop a video then some snake like sounds (szz szz) come from the speaker2 For me it is not comfortable I think this earphone bud is short while boat rokerz 330 has longer ear bud so I buyied rokerz 3303 otherwise all points are best specially bass and battery life
Painfull to wear,3.0,Sound quality is decent for the price range it comes but not comfortable to wear for long time after 10-15 minutes your ear will feel pain i have other companies wire ear phone they are very comfortable so i can wear them 2-3 hour continually  but customer service is good

To exchange or it's service.  Very burst and dum  services now a days.  It's better to take directly from a shop...Now over
Very Good for the price.,5.0,Battery last for almost 40 hrs as advertised and nothing to complain about the sound or quality of the product.
Okay at this range,4.0,Like:LooksSound qualityEase of connect.Dislike:No carry box providedPoor packagingWires are lengthy*Today i got the product but the box was broken and the product seems to be used one.

Now it is not working Purchased on 30 Sep.2019 with 1 year warranty"
Great sound but not a 5 star product.,4.0,"Battery back up is the only problem, and these does not vibrate when your phone rings, so if your phone is on silent/vibration and you have not plugged in the earpiece, you will not know your phone is ringing. So ultimately these need to be in your ears all the time, which is a pain."
"Not happy.. keeps dropping bluetooth, small range",1.0,Writing after Using this item for close to a year and off late now its started to drop the bluetooth connectivity with other party complaining on low to no voice. Also range is just about 10 feet or so.
Best sound quality with longest battery life.,5.0,One of the best wireless bluetooth headsets. Biggest battery life ( from last 2 days showing 100% battery). Best sound quality. Great bass with balanced sound. Dont think too much. Just go for it.
Crackling sound within a month,1.0,The sound quality was good for 20 days . Then the right ear started giving a crackling sound...very  disappointed...
Good buy üëçüèª,4.0,"Thanks Amazon! It was a pretty deal! I am in love with the colour üòç. Though I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the noise cancellation, I had a good experience with Bass and the sound Quality. There was no damage, the packaging was good! I got my delivery within 24 hrs! Good buy!"
No thinking twice,5.0,Better than lot of boats out there.for saving ur battery life once magnets attached it gets disconnected and u get a call and phones aren't in your reach just plug your earbuds you are good to talk.Bass is extremely improved from previous versions .best balance between bass n treable
Fake advertising be aware,1.0,Fake advertising.Friends I have bought this product in January and it was nice but then when I sent it for replacement they send back a complete replica which looks same but cheap quality.Apparently in the name of big discount they are giving out cheap and low quality products as mybrother have  bought one in this month.Weight and dimensions are completely different than before also says as baot rockerz only instead of boat rockerz 255.
WASTE PRODUCT..LOW QUALITY,1.0,"any body dont buy this.. extremely waste product..in 9 months both side speakers got defective...unluckily after one year only able to claim bcz dont know how to claim it,, and got rejected due to sale date...they now it was a serial complaint fo their product and not ready to resolve it..bad customer service also"

These are good but could have been better.,3.0,"Too much bass and therefore less treble on default settings.However the same could be adjusted from (external) phones/ laptops equalizer.Looks good and sporty. The red colour of the wire connecting the buds is soothing and looks good to the eye but the red colour on the actual buds is kind of metallic red which is okish.Takes too long to charge from zero to full, couple hours actually. The battery lasts 5-6 hours which which is okay."
Boat item,4.0,"Boat 255 pro + sound quality is best and 25 hours using it firstly, but the issue is phone call issue not properly sound comeback"
Not for Heavy user,3.0,"I have purchased it in festival sell for 899‚Çπ overall performance is average,Battery backup is good long last for 3,4 days having daily usage of 6,7 hrs. But after using for continuously you can have ear pain. It's due to buds. Bass is ok . Overall rating 3/5 Ok for 899‚Çπ price point."
Great for the buck,4.0,"Based on usage so far I have very few complaints. The buttons that are programmed for volume, can't be programmed for media changer. And that there is no caller id in the earphones, but apart from these I love the product. Yes the sound quality or noise cancellation is not as great as airpods or high end earphones, which is obvious given the cost of the product. But for the price, the product is great."
Product quality deteriorated,1.0,Lost the hearing from left side 2 weeks after I had purchased it. Have been using it for almost 3 years but sadly this last one lasted for only 2 weeks. Sadly the return/refund policy is only for 7 days. Hence I have lost that timeline and post trust in this brand ad there is no way to refund or replace this.
Avg Sound with High Battery backup,3.0,Sound quality is okBattery üîã backup is awesome almost 44 Hours i have noticed. Fast charging works good.This is specifically for watching moviesBut i m also using oppo enco m31 Just Awesome sound specially on bass mode with avg battery backup.. oppo is specially for listening songs...
You can try,3.0,Quality not upto mark but the sound is better than the Realme buds.The power buds when magnetic locked should have shut down the power of the earphone. Moreover the battery backup is upto 5 to 6 hours on continous run.
Good for 6-9 months. Beware of aftersales and service,4.0,"Ease of use: 5/5Lightweight: 5/5Charging time: 5/5Active Run time: 4/5 (ave. 10 hrs useage/day)Bluetooth set up: 5/5Silicone buds: 3/5 (needed to buy additional buds from a hygiene perspective)Unfortunately, since the left-side speaker stopped working. And since it's out of warranty, not sure if I should exchange or buy a new product."
Empty packet was delivered,4.0,"Though the product quality is good as am already using it. Bought this product for my wife but the delivery person delivered an empty packet. However Amazon customer care has refunded the amount within two hours, but I was quit surprised that this will happen."
Ultimate,5.0,Perfect choice for music and movie lovers and regular callers. Sound output is really nice. Signal is perfect even at 10 meters distance. Simultaneously connected to phone and laptop. I feel battery life could have been better. Worth the money spent on this üëå
"Sound quality good, but poor battery backup",3.0,"Sound quality is good although it's battery backup is not 8 hours, it runs hardly 6 hours..But it has amazing sound quality , noise cancellation..."
Not a good product at this price,3.0,"It's okk .in this price segment it is costly. Battery backup not upto 4 hrs. When battery become 20% , it's switch off automatically. sometimes Other side people not got clear voice they complaint about it."
Good but could be better so read before you buy,3.0,"I expected more from it. Sound is not so clear at high volume. Noise cancellation while listening to music in public was like so poor, totally zero. I liked my samsung wired earphones better than this with its sound quality and noise cancellation way better."
A little more expected,4.0,I have got it at 899 on Great Indian Sale.For this price segment it is undoubtedly good.But the vocals and trebles should be more impressive.
Nothing great to talk,3.0,"Good one but not good for music lovers. Noise cancellation is bad, sounds flat without much bass but crisp sound. Build quality is good."
Excellent headset,4.0,BoAt rockers is excellent audio headset at this price. Fortunately I purchased this on offer @899/-.Bluetooth connectivity upto 5-6 mtr works good.Battery backup is also excellent as per specification.
Amazon stolen the correct item,1.0,Do not order it .I have rcvd wrong item which is cheap 100 rs handsfree(Wired). Either vendor shipped it incorrectly or delivery boy stolen it but Great thing is Amazon says that they can not do any thing in this and as per them they shipped correct item and disconnected the call. Now i have left with that cheap earphone instead what i had ordered and paid for.
Customer service is Great.,4.0,Too much bass. Due to the extra bass vocals and some instrumental separations are affected.For a bass lover its the choice.I personally dont love too much bass.But boAt service is top notch. Love boAts customer service.
One side ear piece is not working. Returning it,1.0,"Bought it for 999 rs in Jan mid, 2020 deal. Going to return it. One side of ear piece is not at all working. Seems the seller is selling only defective items in the deal. Very bad"

Price Worthy and Best of the Best Product to Grab,5.0,"It's Simply an Amazing Product for the Music Lovers who can enjoy the best quality of songs in travelling, gym workouts, or for mood change.Loving it so much and i haved owned it at a reasonable price on Diwali sale. 200 % worthy You can go or choose for this 250 BOAT Sports Wifi Bluetooth headphones.I can rate 100% sure for anyone who would like to purchase it or can gift for someone who love music"
Worht buy...for music lovers,5.0,Worht buy...for Music loversMic is good enough..Only other end person mic should be good..then no problem in Conference calls
Very good. 8 on 10,4.0,I'd rate it 8 on 10. The sound is too bassy but u just need to tweak it in ur phone's equalizer and its good to go. I'd say its much better for watching movies than music. For the price its a major go!
Value for money.,5.0,Does the job quite good.Bought it in the sale at 899/-Value for money. Pretty good deal getting a Bluetooth headphones at this price especially of a good company.
Nice Bluetooth head phone,5.0,Writing this review after use of one year.Sound quality is good and headphone is also durable.Battery life can be improved it works three hours higher side at strech
Stopped working after 3 months,2.0,"It was initially performing good, but eventually after 3 months  it has been identified with issues like one side earphone not working sometime , bluetooth connection issues etc. Then it totally stopped working, by advice is to go for good and reliable product rather getting attracted to boAt discounts."
Please get me refund or replacement  of my order,2.0,"Please get me refund or replacement  of my orderJust open to check my ordered piece,  but it is not getting charge neither getting connected to my deviceAlthough charged for about 30min but still problem not resolvedOn top of all odds,  charging wire also already having issue.  Not getting plugged At all.Very much disappointed, However the look and feel is really great and very satisfying.I have placed request for returning the item"
Average,3.0,"This is average earphone. Not comfortable to wear. Cannot wear for long time as it causes ear pain. Expected good quality sound, but it is an average earphone. Disappointed with its neckband. Long wire interrupts in normal working. Only battery backup is good, nothing else is worth."
Awesome product forever,5.0,This is very good in comparison all of Bluetooth headphone or earphone.and most better thing is that product is available to buy in 1399 only and may be less in sale according to quality and every thing.so i recommend to buy only only this product if you want buy bluetooth earphone.
I love the headsets,5.0,"I received my order today packiging could have been  better, but Sound quality is good noise cancellation is also proper and also I love the bass quality as I love heavy bass songs so I like the product and also it is good for those who are into gyming and fitness, one can wear it while running too. I got it of rs899 by lightning deal and I think it was worth buying this product."
The product malfunctions fast,1.0,It has been few weeks since I purchased and the left side ear phone has completely stopped working. Not expected for a product worth ‚Çπ1500. It has now become useless for me. Don't know what to do.
Go for it but no for calling purpose,5.0,I am using this product from last 4 month and got 1 replacement as well. This device is my second headphone.What is best -Battery life - 8 to 10 hrsDurability - if you will use without folding wire this is great.Sound - Amazing.Pairing - you can keep pair with 2 devices like I continually use with cell phone and my Fire tv stickWhat is bad - No noise cancellation so its bad when you will call someone as they will keep listen noise from your side whether your Tv volume is at 2 or 3
Worth buying it,5.0,Durable strong and flexible.Good sound quality and noise reduction.No problem so far working fine.
Good after sales service,5.0,Writing this after 7 months of use first when i got it i didn't like it as it was very bass heavy headphone  but after their burning period they were good Af but in last month got some problem with connectivity and battery charging so I made a complaint on their site and pick up was initiated by boat and now after 15 -20 days I recived a new replacement unit happy with their after sales service  * THANK YOU BOAT
Bass!!,5.0,"I like the whole package(build quality, packaging, earbuds ,light weight, super comfy) the battery is good..it's all comes to the sound quality....for a Rs1200-1500 earphone it's too low....it's all bass...nothing but bass...nobody wants that much bass..used loads of other earphones..sound is too bassy...otherwise descent product"
"Good for listening audio video, but just ok for calls",3.0,"Sound quality while playing media,audio and video is great. But while using call receiving and calling voice didnot delivered clearly to opposite party. I bought 4-5 headsets but 2 of that has the problem like this."
"Okk, not bad",3.0,"Sound is good, call vibration missing, Magnet is just for binding 2 earphones, not more than that.As per general awareness, once magnet disconnect, call or play should be connected, but not works."
Biggest Demerit & Merit!!,3.0,"Almost on every call when connected to my phone the connection breaks and I need to change the mode of call to headset and then reselect Bluetooth to regain connectivity.Most of them due to this the call gets disconnected due to no response in that phase of non connectivity.That's a demerit.Now the good Part, it has wonderful battery backup, good noise cancellation and good sound quality."
Unnecesarily hyped product,2.0,"These ain't worked for me. I din like the overall sound signature.Bass is okayish din have the thump as described in many reviews, the overall loudness is also low.I've used them in POCO F1 and Redmi note 7pro.Finally returned the product. as its not the value for money product."
Best buy who wants great battery backup,5.0,"Battery backup is more than 40 hours literally for movies and listening music its top class,connect at a time 2 devices autoswitch is easy,calling is so great due to Mike near mouth loud and clear. but while playing pubg you will clearly feel the Lag of 4 5 miliseconds"
Dont buy for calling,3.0,I bought it for callingBut dont buy it fir callingOnly if u r in quite area then only u can use it for calling otherwise other person gets irritated with every small sound.A small soound can be very painful for other personSo plz dont buy for callingAnd otherwise average headphone
WORST PRODUCT ...  I have never seen,1.0,Very Bad and worst performanceIt works only 4-6 months after that 100 % Pakka fail...After that no communication of customer care service... No response... Waste of money..... Please choose another brand... Except BOAT
It tooo bad experience with boat 1st time,1.0,This is my 4 th neck band of boatBut this is very worstCharging cable is not connecting with box cableVoice quality is also poorNo bassPoor quality of wireSo dont waste money....
"Must Buy, Awesome Product....",5.0,"Pros:1. Good sound Quality with great base.2. Can feel music, great hearing experience.3. Great battery life, lasts for almost 6 hrs.  charging speed is quite good, takes 2-3 hrs to fully charged.4. Light weight, ear fit is good.5. Noise cancelled is awesome.Cons:1. Durability would be concern, needed to be handled with care.2. It's water resistant not waterproof3. Wires seems to free fall n stretch, it would suggest to tie it with neckband to avoid the same."
Loved it.,5.0,"The value for money is amazing. The sound quality is at par with Sony earphones worth 3K although it breaks a bit at higher volume. The battery backup is decent. I use it everyday in office and elsewhere and one charge is enough for a full day. The build quality is decent for the price, the charging point lid is very flimsy and could be improved with a better one.All in all these earphone are worth the money."
Good product,4.0,"Its good product and very useful to me, very lite whait, only dislike one thig that when i use it i feel my sound / voice surrounding and it not reach to other person and it surond between my room and the people surrounding me. I don't know why but this happen every time every call, i may not use it properly"
Battery is not good,1.0,I'm already using boat headset I didn't have any problem with that so I purchase one more but it's too bad. If I switch on the headset immediately it switched off then how can I use it..i use it only 10days.. I think it's duplicate one... I need replacement or refund immediately... Kindly respond Amazon team
Don't buy.. try some other companies products,1.0,I brought this product before 2 months.. had a complaint with battery.. returned to boat company for service before 50+ days.. still neither received the product nor the cash back.. still the customer care services don't response
Sound is quite low and doesn‚Äôt work for mentioned time,3.0,Good voice quality but sound is too low for the calls at least. Audio volume is bit low than other earphones. Doesn‚Äôt work for committed time for calls.
Seller is the worst. Seller cheated me with faulty product and I could find out after a month,1.0,"Worst product delivered by Amazon, it's been just a month and my product became faulty. There is no sound from one ear piece and amazon kept return or refund for only 10 days. Worst. We buy a product by paying a huge money and they provide us faulty product which wont work after 1 or 2 months."
Disappointing service by Amazon,1.0,"Not suitable for calls so if that's your purpose don't go for it. Also amazon won't refund despite of claiming that it is suitable for attending calls even thought it's not. Apparently, their policies are more important than their customers. Very disappointed in Amazon."
Bad bluetooth connectivity,1.0,I dont know what the problem is but the bluetooth connectivity on the neckband is just worse than ever. It  keeps creating cracking sound in stereo mode all the time means i cant use it in stereo mode and then i issued a replacement from boat after 2 - 3 months and that  product is also bad and i know that there is no problem in my pc.
Worst product and service too,1.0,"Second time I brought the headphone but it‚Äôs pathetic one ..complete disaster. I need to go to service station to change the same ,there is no online pick up done .I got replacement but the issues for this one is the same.I need genuine product and 100%replacement with ok quality .I rate this product 0."
boat Bluetooth headset,3.0,Don't buy bass effect is useless plus no noise reduction. boat wired one cheaper than this price is having good bass. Amazon never test any product for the quality with their tech team. Only doing a courier job. Don't waste money with this product.
Great product for price...,4.0,"Excellent for the price..... much more of what i expected for the price.....Sound is good, quality is good..I would recommend buying it...The only concern is i was not able to register the item on boat website for warranty.Also in was not given choice of colour.... red that i recieved is also goog lookin...."
Bad service,1.0,"Dear allWhoever wants to buy boat , before buying pls think on that service part. because they sell products very easily but very pethetic service they were providing they take more than one month one of my frnd got his product after 2 and half month from service center. Pls think once if productsl get defective then very irritative to get back as soon"
Didn't like bass and battery life of this earphones,2.0,"Price is best.Worst battery life.Four years back, I purchased Nokia wireless earphone, which had option save battery when not working, but Boat don't have that yet in this earphones.If you are using apple earphones, then you'll not like bass of this Boat earphones."
not even close to satisfactory,1.0,Not satisfactory at all.Highly disappointed.The earphones have very short wires and therefore keep falling off.Havent had a good experience with Boat.Not planning to buy ever again.
Poor quality,2.0,Very poor quality sound it is not more than a roadside cheap neckband. Please ignore this product. Pods are too big it almost soffocating your ear. Hardly you can wear it for half an hour.
Average product,4.0,"Nice product... but a bit high price.It could have much better sound quality at this price. I have always loved ""Boat"", it is one of the best product of boat but could be better. Sound quality is average... not upto the mark. I was expecting it to be more clearwith better base n treble."
Worst sound quality with best battery backup,3.0,Review after 15 days useThe product is designed good very poor sound quality only noisy sound only loudness is there no proper sound bits no proper bass bits. Dear pains after 1/2 an hour useBest battery backup even after 10 days I m using this with 30% rest
#worst brand boat,1.0,Worst quality product. Even worst is the warranty service by the brand. They not at all replying for the queries related to warranty. Don't buy these product. They stopped working after 6 months only.
Not Happy with the product,3.0,"Overall performance is below average.It takes time to connect with Bluetooth. And when you finally connect it , there is some airy sounds come (I don't know if it's the problem with just my earphones or it happens with everyone).Sound quality is okay.There is not much noice cancellation.Bass quality is just like 255"
Sound quality is nice but product quality is poor,3.0,"Dear Boat,Ear plug broken within 2 months.... request you to plz let me know the replacement policy..."
Don't buy. Your ears will pain. I  regret it,3.0,Everything else is great but the major issue with this earphone is its very hard for ears and your ears will start paining within 30 mins of usage and i also tried all 3 earbuds which come from company but still the same issue. Also there's no refund policy from Boat only replacement will be given. So don't buy as I'm regretting my decision.
A broken Boat,3.0,Returned the product as it is not upto what i expected. Too much bass i like bass but its not a quality bass. You will definitely need a equalizer if you are like me. Sound quality is not at all good.
Good sound but ear buds are fragile,1.0,Product worked good for 5 months and then the right ear bud stopped working...so better to avoid it...even after handling with care the ear bud is very fragile. Pathetic  experience with boat customer care..they work in BC age..no response from them to replace the damaged ear bud.
Average product,3.0,"Vocals volume is low, music quality is good, Design is ok ok , can't wear more time, battery quality is good, charging speed is good, call clearity is good, bass is ok, overall good product in this price range.Stopped working after 3 month"

"In 899 best wireless headphone, vocal is very low thats the problem.",4.0,"I bought it in 899 only. In 899 you will get this kind of product which is really great. The bass is really high,you can't hear all the instrument because of this. Otherwise it is a great wireless headset.. Boat is really good in mid range market love itüòçü§ó"
Good quality product under 1500,4.0,"Most of the things are very good under this budget, but the only cost cutting i saw is the joints of the wire which is made of plastic instead of rubber.. But still one of the best bluetooth earphone under 1500"
Total Value for Money.,5.0,"No wireless earphone better than this one in thisPrice range.Its Affordable,easy to use while driving,sound quality also good.The best thing is its very much durable.I‚Äôm using is since 5-6 months and is working fine.No other wireless earphone has worked this long for me.Total value for money. Go buy it."
Sweating/itching in ear's - not good,1.0,"I can give only 1 star , though technically sound quality / battery is good. All of my family members felt sweating/itching in the ear's after few mins of call / video's.  And no return also , only replacement , so no chance of recovering your valuable money. I bought at 1300 rs , which I felt got wasted. :( :( :("
Value for money,4.0,"Ill give you honest review about this earphone. Excellent performance. Battery life very good. You can use whole day. I ordered 3 at a time from myntra at 900rs. That's was a very amazing offer on it. 2 connection works perfectly. But sometimess it gets auto disconnect but again it gets connected. But this is a case of one of my earphone, not with every earphone. I have all three colours. I'llI recommend you to buy this, as at this price you will not find any better earphone. Overall value for money."
Honest review,5.0,"1) Its value for money in given price for wireless  headphones .2)noise cancelation  , bass quality is not good as  mentioned.3) good for calling purpose.4) material quality is good.5)* Buy this product if you are reading this review  because  I alredy  bought two  .*"
Better go for some other product,1.0,Great earphones! But you can't tolerate the pain it givesEdit : review of 10 months usagePower button is not working and unable to press it. Their warranty period is 6 months. Should I pay them 1000 just for 10 month use? Now i have to pay for the repair. Very disappointing! Never expected this from boat
Disconnecting in every few minutes,2.0,"Used few days and found that sometimes device is disconnecting very frequently or every minute. Range is another issue, can't cross another wall. Sound quality is not up to mark due to bass I think."
Everything is good but after using so long time very painful for ear...,3.0,Everything is good but its not comfortable for ear...
Too good headphones!!! just a bit shaky on receiving call when two devices are connected.,5.0,"Go for the headphones blindly if you are getting it below 1500. Such a awesome sound quality. Had been using it for almost 6 months and they are awesome I tell you.  Best part it is not like most of the bass earphones who sound is not bearable. Just a con, when connected to two devices, say you are listening to music from computer and suddenly receive a call from phone then the voice is bit shaky. Also the range is too good for a earphone like this. Best one from Boats!!!!"
"Battery indication is not accurate, showing only 100,80,60,40,20 percentages.",2.0,"Battery indication is very poor. Only 100,80,60,40,20 percentages are showing and can't able to define the exact charging percentage. Magnet is weak, can easily get separated with little force even.Better to go with other products with a comparison"
Complaint regarding boat earphone 255 pro,1.0,"Worst product ever. I have buy this product on 9 th august 2020 and today is 8th September.Now, This is not taking charging. Worst battery backup even local devices can give a battery backup of 7-8 days. Above of all, I am searching here and there for service (under guarantee).I have called amazon service centre too but as usual i have got wrong number."
Bass quality is very poor sound clarity is ok ok. Better great charging fast not for music üé∂,1.0,I have doubt it's real are duplicate because sound quality is very poor very ..  its number one selling brand but sound quality bass quality is very poor even in hip hop song. Majja ni aaya ...
Good product,4.0,"Comparing to the cost, it‚Äôs not a great purchase. The quality of the product is rather okay, not disappointing."
Fake,1.0,Seems like a duplicate productCannot return as wellBrand like amazon should only sell genuine products
Amazing product from boAt,5.0,Perfect product in this price range. Sound quality is decent does not hurt your ears. Battery backup is also very good. Connects with phone in seconds.It fulfilled my purpose.
Not much satisfied,3.0,"It has an electronic sound and its doesn't give the clarity of sound when we play it on our phone speaker. It's a bit old and some sort of sound is heard when not playing the music. It doesn't provide you a good quality . And to buy now, You may go for new boat products or one plus bullets. Don't buy these old products. Mi basic earphones are far better than this product"
Only one problem otherwise perfect for music lover,4.0,"Cool earphone It can cover 3 to 5 meeter range and earbuds are good take the shape of inner ear but earplugs which are fitted in ear have loosed and sometimes come out from buds so I have to very carefull about it. If it missed then it wouldn't get replacement and your earphone will go in trash This is only problem with it otherwise sound quality,look,fitting in any type ear and bass are awesome....Have a Good.......:-)"
Not comfortable at all and doesn't work properly.,1.0,I used this earphone for 1 day and found that the people from other hand could not hear my voice.. I can hear their voice  but my voice was not audible.. might be there is an issue with its mic.. it's battery is worst.. it works for 1 hour and then I have to charge it again.. it's not comfortable at all. I'm want my money back for this item as it feels like I wasted  ‚Çπ1500
If you take calls from this headset I don't recommend you to buy this,2.0,Sound quality is not crystal clear...On high volume it's very bad...The microphone is very bad actually that doesn't have noise cancellation...when ever I take a call when there is little disturbance...They other person is not able to listen my voice but he's able to listen all the disturbances.I literally hate this.even I replaced but the same problem that means this product is not well built
"Average Sound Quality, cheap quality bass & Captures surrounding Noise",3.0,"Ergonomically fit & little comfortable but captures surrounding noise so terrible noise cancellation,sound volume and bass quality. Has some problems in Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity too. Nota C-type charging port. Good build quality, satisfied with back-up (4-5 hours at full charge) and charges really fast though."
Samsung mobile not supporting,2.0,Boat company is awesome bt it's not support properly to Samsung mobile volume is very low and i connected to other mobile also then was working fine bt with Samsung not working properly so Samsung people don't buy it
Please read before buying,5.0,I want to write this review becoz I feel people buy on review basis. In my opinion this a fantastic option in cheaper range as I am a yoga trainer and trains online .

"In my opinion, is not value for money. Ready to spent more but needs quality",3.0,"The sound quality is not satisfactory, you need to focus more to have clarity in communication, Bass is much below from my expectations. Noise cancellation dose not work specially while moving or traveling in public transport."
Everything is good except dual connectivity.,4.0,Everything works fine and its a good product in this price range. but there is a little problem with it. Most of the time it does not connect automatically to my laptop when its already connected to my phone.

Good bass and sound but faulty piece,3.0,In 20 days the rightside went faulty. Good to have the warranty terms. They picked very fast and waiting for replacement pieceUpdate- received the new piece in around 8 days. Good service
Battery Life and bass,5.0,"The quality of this earphone is good and its sound quality is fine, can not say very good but according to the range it comes in, it is very good and especially its bass has been given a lot of attention and the biggest thing is that  Its battery claims 40 hours but I am using it for two days"
Buy at your own risk..,1.0,Writting this review after one month of use. Initially it was very good. Battery life was awesome. But suddenly for few weeks i did not use it and now if i check it back its not Working.When i keep it in charging then only its switching on. If i remove the charging it is dead.
Worth every penny,5.0,I have been using is over 1.5 years.. it's stunning.. sound quality is amazing and is super durable. I like the band's quality. Never had any connectivity issues. Even battery lasts reasonably. It was a happy purchase!! May be one thing to call out is that during jogging it doesn't stay upright. Needs a bit holding off.
Do not buy,1.0,"Very very bad product, sound is very bad, quality is worst. Charging time one hour and it just allow 1 hr battery capacity."
Stopped working within a month,1.0,Charged the headphones and went to use it but now the earphone is not starting. It's constantly showing blue light but no voice nor does it connect to bluetooth. Need a replacement
Best,5.0,A trust worthy brand which also provides good quality products - though prices are on higher side But as said to Quality comes at price
Quality product,5.0,"Its a good wireless handset for this price. Sound quality is acceptable at this price range. More importantly is if you are not a heavy user battery life is very good. Sometimes I use the headset for 7-8 days (i am not a heavy user, mostly 3-4 hours per day) from a single charge."
Quality gets deteriorated in a couple of months,3.0,"This is after 5months, I'm writing after buying this product.While talking through a phone call, there will be heavy voice disturbance, and you need to swith from bluetooth mode to normal mode and talk normally.So I don't prefer/recommend this product.Battery also not much good"
Pathetic Product,1.0,"Hi Team,Its not even 1 Year i bought this product and i have been facing challenges for sound quality from past 6 months. The time i bought the product was of INR 1500 which is far more high than current prices and services are very pathetic. Request you to kindly change the product as i trust Amazon a lot for its services."
Within 2 months 25 days Device stopped working,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Unable to switch on the device even after charged for 3 hours. Not able to use. When the charging is on the blue light is blinking, tried multiple times to charge it and use but in vain. Bought it on 1 st August 19but within 3 months the device is not working. Thinking that I made a wrong decision by Busying bOAT device , unfortunately advised some of my colleagues who bought it last week. Waste of money."
Don't buy the retailer is distributing duplicate earphones.,1.0,Worst bluetooth earphone ever bought in my life the bluetooth mic got broke in 10 days it didn't worked after 1 week when I thought to get it to the repair shop and the earphones also broke and when get to the repair shop he said that baAt is a nice company but the retailer have got you the duplicate one . Its literally a money waste thing I should recommend you to not buy it.
WOOOHOOOOO JUST A WOW PRODUCT,5.0,- good battery backup with minimum of 10 hrs- for boat bass is really good- value for money- best in sound classNo CONS as such but for charging it takes around 1hrs 30min

Like Bass? Take it. I bet on you'll like.,5.0,"I have been using this for last 3 years. I love it so much that can't help liking any other brand's bluetooth earplugs...Bass : 10000/100Amazing built quality. Yes, i have used it roughly and it flies off my neck while riding a motorcycle. But it's ignored. Worth buying.Thanks boat."
Lag in audio when watching movies with VLC (slightly lagging),3.0,Sound quality is 3.8/5Bass is good 4/5Call clarity bad 2.5/5Bluetooth range is 5 to 5.5 metersSound distorted when you move to the next room.boAt Bassheads 242 Wired Headset is better in every way.And most importantly there is a slight lag in video and audio.... If you watch movies you will a lag.. which is why I am returning it.
Good,5.0,"Sound quality, moisture wicking are very great. Noise cancelation is good. But I observed switching off before battery is even more than 20%. Build quality and performance are good. And very comfort to use."
Good headphones. Bluetooth connection is interfering with other Bluetooth and wifi connections,4.0,Excellent headphones for sound.Major hindrance in multitasking ( hence reducing 2 stars )It's connection interferes with other Bluetooth or WiFi connection or casting causing problems.
"The battery is fantastic , unbelievable I would say",5.0,"Too much base I think ,but if you have player with graphic equaliser you should be able to controlOverall this an outstanding product for this price"

Manipulative image,4.0,"Everything is good about the earphone like noise cancellation, bass and sound quality but i would like to say that there is discrepancy while showing the product image. The one which i got is totally different from what is shown in the picture. Please do not show such manipulative image  after making changes in it like highlight and colour diversion."
NOT BAD !!,4.0,"I brought this a month back and it is working fine, but battery backup is not goodI only got 6hrs of playback. While my previous realme earbuds are too great, it had MORE then12 hrs of playback and sound quality is also good. I recommend REALME BUDS... If ur running with low budget but need a good earbuds  then go for boat rockers!!"
Average earphones but good quality to prevent wear and tear,3.0,"Well the material is quite good prevents tangled wires and breakages.. but the plug in ear is not so soft and comforting..Sound is okish serves purpose for call and audio, i bought it based on the review count this product had and may b should look at other factors as well"
Value for money,4.0,One of a best at this price. All day companion. Recharging quick. Set automatically to stand-by mode after 5seconds of not using. Worth buying it.
Connect problem,1.0,I purchase this product one month agoAnd now a noice is coming from its earpode while using it. Further while using it with laptop its automatically disconnected itself from the device many times whic cause a lot of problems. Please check itout and help if it get replaced.
Better to but another version or boat rockerz...,3.0,"After using it for 6 monthsPro-1.sound is good2.design is good but u can not keep it in ur pocket3.magnetic buds with rubber lock to fit in earCons- battery backup is too bad, runs hardly 2-3hours... N my battery also get puffed..."
Good,4.0,"Reviewing after using 2months , sometimes while receiving call it was already connected but unable to hear anything want to disconnect and reconnect again other than that it is okey to use also battery durability is low ,in continuous usage want to charge twice a day"
boat is fraud company dont buy boat product,1.0,"Not working after 3months (neon). customer service is the worst.  They pick up product for exchange/ repair but don't give back any response. worst my product also is gone and money too.they pick up my product from April start but still, I have not received any replacement. And amazon also not doing any action on it. worst product n ""fraud company Boat""."
OK. Not great.,3.0,First irritating thing is the message that we get when we turn it ON or when it is connected to a device. I hate that voice. we cannot mute it and we have to bear it.  Battery  backup is also not great.  Sound quality is good.
Good sound quality & nice battery,5.0,"Connectivity is not good, can connect two phones at a time but seems to loose connectivity every now and then.battery life is good it last almost for a day.sound quality is nice and loud."
A must buy product but only in amazon sale,5.0,Arrived early. Quality is good. Bass is too good only thing is the ear buds hurt not very good. Nd when you are out travelling the opp person can hear the background more then your vooce thats the biggest problem
Not satisfied with the product,1.0,"This product didn't meet my expectations. Malfunctioning is the normal course of thing with this product & the worst part is their customer care redressal system. It worked properly for at least 15 days. In one word, have wasted my money & time. Have thrown this product & ordered a different one from different company."
i received a duplicate product,1.0,I think i got a wrong product because day by day its ink is disappearing day by day and it been a month I m using it I m very disappointed with this product I have seen this kind of product and their BOAT ink is still visible with bright white colour and they have bought around 3 to 4 month ago I want an action  against this thing and I hope you will understand my situation because RS1000  is the money I have spent on this thing .
A not bad product. There are other options too.,3.0,"I have been using this earphones for about 7 months.The left ear piece has stopped working already.Till it worked, the sound and performance is all adequate for you in the price range.The bluetooth works fine, but not good while travelling.The wires annoy you most of the times.Now I must say, there are better products out there in the market. You could consider this a least resort."
Long lasting battery,5.0,The product works pretty good also it works for 4 days without charging and if you want to charge it takes only an hour or a bit more . Value for money as it is waterproof
Not worth,2.0,1. Takes more than 30-45 mins for full charging2. You can use it for about 3 hours with full charge. But goes from 60% charge to 0 in 10 mins. You cant listen to music/calls once the charge falls below 40% as it keeps saying less charging every 10 secs. Utter crap.3. Noise cancellation is also not very effective.You can buy better products at this price. Not worth the money.
Boat is Good Indian Product,5.0,Sound too good and noise less earphone and bass quality is soo better.Worth for moneyGood indian productAppario retail give a good product...To order appario retail product....Product is too good
good but not comfortable.,3.0,"It doesn't have air vents so when you adjust the buds, the air inside cramps in ear and could potentially hurt. Other than that, everything good. The vents are major concern"
Not very satisfied,4.0,The main reason I needed this product was for my morning work out. But it‚Äôs not at all comfortable while running. Another downside to this was the sound quality which isn‚Äôt consistently good
Very good....,4.0,"I m purchsng dis product fr secnd time. Dis is  a awsm product, fr travelling prpose. Those r mad of music, they might gt some negative points. Packng can be much bettr compr to the price. This headph is hlpfull fr gymng n running... For me I am very satisfied..."
Product experience is not good.....,1.0,Bluetooth connectivity is really bad. It losts connection so many times even when i am holding my phone in my hand which is connected to this device..... Some times songs r lagging because of the connection problem and it cuts few seconds of the lyrics while playing a song because of the connectivity problem...Sound quality is likeable if you are a bass lovers....Noise cancellation is not that good.....
Reasonable product for 999,4.0,I was right in budget and wanted to buy earphones while I saw this with good reviews... So decided to buy it... I can say that this is really good but I feel battery life isn't good .. max to max 5-6 hours ... Else everything is good
Worst experience of my life to buy them,1.0,Please dont buy them they shows that 1 yr of replacent warranty but they a big lierEven now its almost 30 days but i dont get my rockrzz back but a single mesaage recieved from them is we will repaired and send back to meThey are cheap but not durable its only 3 months but charging issues connection issuesPlzzPlzzzPlzzzzzDont buy rockrzzz

Good to buy but...,4.0,"Battery about 25-30 hoursHurts a lot in ears very hard rubber qualityBase is good, sound is goodMagnet is not strong but yes it's availableCONCLUSION: YOU CAN BUY IT BUT NOT FOR LONG USE PAINS A LOT THE ONLY PROBLEM"
Not nice compared to previous version,1.0,Everything is fine but compare to previous model this makes noise as soon as I unlock the phone....Even if don't play anything
Product Quality Review,3.0,"Pros1. Product is durable during workouts and changing weather conditions2. Has demonstrated good battery backupCons1. Treble, bass and other tunnings doesn't take any effect on this productOverall : The money paid would be of value if you're focus is same as the above pros and also should be in a position to compromise the music quality/feel to some extent."
Sound quality is too poor,2.0,"Battery backup is excellent. But sound quality is too poor.  Ear pains during usage.  Bass and noice cancellation is worst at its part.  Not a value product. Waste of money on this particular product. Feels like under 500rs product, without sound quality."
Boat,2.0,Too bad.... Given old product and used product.... Package is damaged... I returned it... Dont like the teal green color.. Very bad... Not as shown in image.
Bad experience,1.0,I don't know if it's just me or is this happening for anyone else. My phone is failing to pair with this device as it gets switched off in the middle of the pairing time..the box that I received was also not very promising. I seriously feel that the product has been replaced by a fake one. Not expected from the dealer/Amazon!!
Battery issues,2.0,As I am not able to use this product since last 2 mongh due to battery issues....as this productis still in warranty....so pls can any boats customer care team can call me to solve the same.....even some times I tried calling ur customer care but couldn't connect...other than battery every thing is good
Great sound quality,5.0,"This is the best earphone that I have bought. The earbuds fits snugly and if you don't like the size of the preinstalled ones they give extra earbuds to match your size. It has great sound quality, great bass and the magnetic lock keeps the earphones secure on your neck when not in use. The neck band is also very comfortable."
Poor Quality product,1.0,"noise cancellation"", ""bluetooth connectivity"". Even with full battery in between calls it looses bluetooth connection and again it gets connected. Its really not good product. Hope Boat will look into it and arrange replacement"
Theft protection option is not there,4.0,Battery back up is very good and looking is not good design is not good but battery and use for quality is good
Very good battery life,5.0,I will use the ear phone for my online classes it is very good in sound and bass but the noise cancelling is not very bad but it's worth it when I unbox earphone battery will be 100 and second it will be 80 when I use this for 6 to 7 hour its really good i am using for while 2 month it still good
Just a daily use product not premium.,5.0,"Sleek and sounds good. Bass quality is poor, and if you expecting called noise cancellation, sorry you will regret so after. Best part is the battery backup upto 8 hours for random use."

Pathetic Sound Quality and Poor fitting headphones,2.0,"Looks something else, company claims something else and the product is absolutely something else. It's pathetic. Fit-wise. Sound quality wise. Poor poor product. I mean, you price tag your product 3000Rs. Then give a flat discount of 50%. It is all only making a fool out of customers. You better give a product for 3000Rs only but give a satisfactory product. Have some ethics guys."

Picks up surrounding noise,2.0,It's difficult to use this for a phone call if standing in a noisy place. The headphone picks up all the noise from the surroundings and the recepient of the phone call is unable to hear anything you say.
Check the genuinity,5.0,Just unboxed the Boat rockers 255I am in love with the audio output.. Its simply amazingJust a bit sceptical about the genuinityNot sure if i have received a new unit .. the area where the wires connect to the earpiece seem like it was stuck for the 2nd time.Please notice in the image how well the area where wire meets earpiece near the green arrow looks well but the one near orange arrow is not... There is a white ring around it.

Battery üîã and sound quality is incomparable.,4.0,"Everything else is fine, but its battery is none compared to the one we took on 8th October in just 799 rupees only in festival offers and runs for two hours in a day and till now only charged once just in betweenSound quality is also good and brass quality is also fine The product I got is also durable."

Packing was worst. Earphone are good. Worst microphone ever,3.0,If you guys looking for playing pubg.. Buy it now. Only if your phone has Bluetooth 5.0. Than only it will not lag in gaming. And earphone are good in sound. Package delivery was worst. With any protection cover or carton..
Disappointed,1.0,"I bought this headset and its hardly 4 months, now microphone is not working .. and highly disappointed with that. Also slips easily off the ear while jogging or in other activity"

I bought it in 999rs also get additional 200 cash back as amazon pay balance.Great service by Amazon and boat, i got my order within 6 hrs through prime now app."
Good not best!,4.0,Good one but not best one. Sound quality could have been better for sure! But its nice and comfortable enough to put it in ears! You can go for them!
Too loud. Music isn't clear.,3.0,I bought the earphones around 15 days ago so it's too early to say about longevity but what I have observed is that the sound quality is not good. Its too loud and hurts the ear and you don't get to notice the low notes of music clearly. One of my friends has Mi Bluetooth earphones and they have much greater clarity.
China product,1.0,"Although boat is an Indian company and I went for it basis the indian name, However the product i received is made in china.Regret to purchase this"
6 months used... Good product - Worth the price,3.0,"Excellent Battery backup - lasts around entire day for general, non continuous use.Good sound quality...Edit: After 7 months, one side not working. Raised complaint on boat website, awaiting response."
dual connectivity,5.0,amazing quality.pure bass and maintain sound. noice cancelation.battery backup is osm.and main thing in this product is dual connectivity. its bluetooth 4.0 connectivity i give 10/10.
Good Headset with few flaws,3.0,The frequency of the Bluetooth us not that good. There is blur noise when we talk without our mobile near. It mentioned as 10m was the limit but I don't think it was 10m radius. Although talking in mobile looks good compared to call in laptop. Weight less and looks classy. I bought it for 1400. Yeah better buy for 1000-1200
Excellent,5.0,"Deadpool versus excellent the best quality the voice clarity, the 10 percentage of battery itself the iPhone will be turned off"
Bass heaven !,5.0,"Definitely recommended for relishing lower frequency  bass  ... Value for your buck at this price point !Noise cancellation too good ...make sure someone is at home to answer doorbell ,phone or someone crying out to you ."
Best in Class. Review after 2.5 months continuous usage.,5.0,"Pros: Performs as claimed. Battery backup is too good and noise cancellation quality is adequate as you expect but better than most competition.Cons: Earbuds should be more ergonomically designed, sometimes it just fells off even if you plug it properly"
Good product,5.0,Best companyMy earphone were not working the company service is so good that they send a pickup for the product and replaced it with new one . And the quality of the product is very good. It is a quite durable product.
Good but not the best,3.0,If you can spend that much money on this product then you should probably look for some other earphones. It has nice sound quality and all but it doesn't work for gaming at all. Also for movies or videos it just amplifies all the background sound I can barely watch a movie with those disturbing noises.
False commitment of warranty.,1.0,Warranty service is really pathetic. Lodged complain almost one month before. They picked up defective item but still didn't receive good one as my product is under warranty. Multiple times I had communicated through mail but no response. No one is available at customer care desk. Completely waste product and wrong commitment. They are using warranty word only to sell product.
Good Product for this cost. Mic quality is average.,5.0,Good sound Quality product for this price. Battery is good as it comes for 6hrs of usage. My only concern is mic quality is not as expected as more surrounding noise is captured when speaking. Other than this it's money worthy.
All good except call quality...,3.0,First things firstHeadphone is very good...Connenctivity is awesome...Connects two devices simultaneously... If u r watching on one device and u receive a call on another then movie will get paused automatically...The only complaint is call quality... I had received Almost 15 calls on the day when i used it for first time.. and almost all of them asked me to remove my headphones... Bcoz they couldn't listen my voice properly....So consider this before.. overall ok..
Buy cautiously,3.0,I bought this product a month ago and it worked fine for two weeks. Later I found there is a lot of disturbance when I used them. First I thought it was my network which was bad but it's the earphones only. I tested them multiple times and found there is almost 10% disturbance.Realme earphones are much better than these. Try and go for them.
Boat 225,4.0,Sound quality good  ...  botton are smoth..  battery backup is good 4 normal use...  looks and qualitywise superb... I got it in rs 999
Not a good buy,4.0,You may get a defective product. Locate the nearest service center. Keep your bill with you. Keep the original packaging with you. They will replace it at the drop of a hat.Update : May 2021 stopped working abruptly
Good not Great,3.0,"You can take this as a bluetooth version of boat wired 220/225 headsets.Sound and bass is great but not clear in few situations.Noise cancellation was worst to the core voices of people 10m away from you is clearly captured and irritates you to the core, don't know whether it is a product issue which i received.I missed to notice with in the return duration otherwise would of replaced it.Now i need to reach support team for replacement."
Very good product,5.0,"It is very good bluetooth earphones at this price. The sound is very good. Once u plug it in, you cannont hear the outside noises. Though, there is an issue that there is no noise cancellation on calls. Otherwise it is very good."
Poor Battery,1.0,"Sound Quality is good, product quality is good, but disappointed with the battery. With 60%-70% volume, it hardly works for 3 hours, this is very bad considering the brand."
Not satisfactory,3.0,"Build quality, Connectivity range and most of all batter backup is very poor. Returned it and bought realme ear buds for 500 more but 12hrs backup and better build design."
Don't buy for online gamming like PUBG,4.0,Sound cancellation is good Bluetooth connectivity is good but if you want to buy it for online gamming like PUBG then don't buy it...In this headphone make latency during game‡§ï‡•ã‡§à headshot ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§≤‡§ó‡§æ ‡§¶‡•á‡§ó‡§æ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡•ã ‡§™‡§§‡§æ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§ö‡§≤‡•á‡§ó‡§æ!!
"Working fine, no issues",4.0,"The quality of product is good. Ear bugs are also comfortable to wear and sound is nice. Working well with my MacBook, two other phones with no issues. It connects to one device only at a time."
Charging is not C type (non standard),2.0,It's charger is not C type ...its pin is of earlier version with two pin ...difficult to charge .
SOUND LATENCY,1.0,Sound latency is there in using some apps like hotstar nd pubg mobileSo don't buy these earphones for gaming purpose
Great Wireless Headphones!!!,5.0,I was waiting for a few days before writing this.1. Amazing sound quality for the price point. Good bass output without muddying the rest of the frequency. Descent mids and highs.2. Really good passive noise cancellation. Couldn't even hear people talking next to me.3. Good Bluetooth connection. Was able to step out of the room and still managed to maintain a descent connection through 2 walls.
Poor build quality. Pathetic after sales service.,1.0,"Product stopped working after 2 months. And they sent a broken piece as replacement when warranty was claimed. Phone's unreachable. No response to email, and further complaints where declined."
Worst experience,1.0,I would like to return this product but tegy haven't left the option as well boat headphones are good but I think I have a got a defect piece it won't  last even for half an hour Amazon India kindly help me with this
Great for the price,5.0,"This is my 2nd purchase and it works as advertise. For the price this is best what one can get. Good bass, don't ask for low as it's just a decent wireless sport earphones. good fit, has some extra pair ear buds."
Vera level product from boat,5.0,Vera level product from boat.sound quality is super cool.Noise cancellation wrks perfect and bass is asusal proves its boatü§© one and only thing i think weird is altert voice it could have been a female voiceüòÖ other voice its all cools and superb
Average bass reproduction,3.0,Bass reproduction is not good. This product does not even complete with its wired counter part Basshead 225. Disappointed from boAt this time!üôÑüëéüèº
Bad product that ever expect from a BOAT brand,2.0,After using 1 month I am giving a review its worst facing problems 1 side of ear phone not hearing and 2nd side also going to lost hearing. Sound quality of Boat is nice but its got inner damage within 1 month. Not expecting from this boat. Trying to replace the product and I had uploaded the original invoice of amazon but saying an invalid invoice by boat.
Great bass . But bad sound quality,3.0,It really have a great bass. But i don't really like the sound quality. I mostly use over ear which is 40 mm driver so for me this 10 mm driver sounds really bad. In order to give the bass in this 10 mm driver they have sacrificed the sound quality. And it has a mind-blowing battery life.
Recd used headphone,1.0,Bad experience for this product. Inner box recd open condition. And product also recd used headphone. Pls look this type service given to customers. Disappointed for your service. üò†üò†üò†üò†
Worthy of the Price,4.0,"worthy of Investment as it serves a nice audio output, negates the noise perfectly. Battery life is good as well (I'm not a heavy user so 5-7 hours is exceptionally good for me, otherwise depends on one's uses). However, it lags very frequently if connected to two mobiles at a time and you put it on hold for some time as well as you are getting continuous notifications on one or both the phones."
Connected & Disconnected frequently so worthless,1.0,I was delivered a defective product. Connected & disconnected within 20 second frequently.Shame on you Amazon as due to Corana I opened my parcel after 10 days.
Whats app call,4.0,"Cannot receive whats app call using button on the head set. Alternatively whats app call can be accepted on handset then it automatically works on headset.Other wise its a pretty decent buy for 999,00. Bass/base sound is more when on music or movies suppressing other music or vocal content. Bass lovers would love it."
Simply good,2.0,Today it comes to me ..I am being very much confused about this product after watch the review but still it's a good product and rest is almost good but now I feel that the magnet is so weak I think so bcoz I already use a boat product of my fnd but he had a strong magnetic buds ..that's a fear for me
Nice nice very very nice,5.0,Very very nice prodakt I love it the sound is the best of no.1
A boAt that beats the rest... üí§üí§üí§,4.0,"Quality products from boAts. Got it for Rs. 999/- in the Amazon Great Indian Festival. At par with any wired earphones as far as sound quality is concerned. Bass sound is crystal clear. Connectivity is also good and sharp. Charging sustains over substantial period for average to heavy listener. Only con being 'To listen to FM with it, you need to attach wired earphones to your mobile which is bit inconvenient'. Overall a product that I will recommend to music lovers."
One of the headphones stopped functioning in less than 6 months of purchase.,3.0,"I bought boat bluetooth in the first week of August 2019 and have been using it from then. Quality of the sound and connectivity were awesome. BUT by end of December 2019, right headphone stopped delivering the sound. I had to use only one headphone from past one month.Mentioned was one year replacement warranty. Hoping to get a replacement as soon as possible."
this is used product very bad experience.,1.0,this is used product. music playback is 6 hours and Bluetooth version is 4.1 on the box but on amazon music playback is 8 hours & Bluetooth version is 5.0. this is wrong product. i want to replace this product. i want right product.
"Best under ‚Çπ1,000",4.0,"Considering the price tag of ‚Çπ999, definitely  this is the best one. Also, the after sales service of Boat is reliable althou it takes nearly 40 days but it's okay I guess.Coming to the audio section, we get a balanced output. Bass is neither high nor low but average. Vocals are not that clear but fine."
good choice,5.0,good looking. good product quality. good sound output and quality.compairing with LEAF RUSH boat 255 is good choice. go for it. got this item for ‚Çπ899.

Good. I recommend to adults only.,4.0,Product is too good. Sound quality and bass superb.But i think its not suitable for boys. My son 15 years old and I purchase this item for online class. But Headset Often drop Even for 1 minute also.
Buying this headphone is worth it,5.0,"Sound quality is just awesome and the most important thing is it is comfortable in your ears if you put it for hours. Battery stand by is too good, I can use it for almost 1 and a half day after charging once. If you are searching for a good and durable headphone just go for it."
Horrible product,1.0,Absolutely horrible product. It is so heavy my ears has started aching badly. It's not up to the mark at all. I raised a request so you all can take this product and refund my money. I don't need a replacement. Please come and collect it.
In Budget Earphone,4.0,"I bought these earphones a week ago everything is all good. The sound quality is superb. The only thing I faced bad was sometimes the connection is poor i,e sound comes breaking and then you have to reconnect it. Battery life is good it charges fast and builds quality is also okay.The only recommendation is at its price is high, you can buy others too with more features."
Not suitable for online meetings/Poor performance with laptop,3.0,Performance not good when connected to PC. Microphone as well as sound quality is not good when it is used for online meeting puposes..If u just want it for listening music then go for it. But do not buy if u expect more than this.
manufacturing quality not upto the mark,3.0,The product should be made more durable its just a month i been using it and its body is broken(charging slot cover )  and as it comes under pyhsical damage they are even not gonna repair it .i paid a handfull amount of money for a showpiece i guess cause now that earphones are resting in my wardrobe
Dissatisfied product,1.0,"I raised a request to return this earphones in just two days after purchase. I use OnePlus 6T while play pubg squad members can't hear my voice clearly, the rubber which is giving with earphones is not that soft quality, ears will start burning after 30 to 40 minutes of usage. I don't recommend it"
Worst Product with Worst Service,1.0,I would not even give 1 star to this product.Within 2 months it had battery issues and even after replacement its not working properly.(One side not working)On top of that these people won't respond to your call or call you back and don't even respond your mails.Worst product with worst service
Not even close,1.0,Their newer v2 and pro versions are nothing like not even close to their previous versions. I have boat rockerzzz 270 and they still rocking perfectly with crystal clear and stereo sound. One major up for this 255+ pro is its battery backup. If you use these for calls they it may last more than two days.
Bad product bad service bad Amazon service,1.0,"Product is defective, lose connection problemI will raise the refund request but no one come to collect itSecond time i raised the return request no one come to collect the defect productThis is the service given by Amazon !"
Good product,4.0,Expected performance.Worthy product. I am happy with this purchase.it stands high with its brand name
Road side products,1.0,Only battery backup is awesomeBut the sound is so bad. Too much pitch and bass is low. And light fake beats. Not solid beats.Other earphone are great but this earphone benifits is only long long battery üîã. Otherwise there are no benifits.Go for another one
Worth for the money,4.0,"Worth for the money, Battery is great 5 to 6 hours, and good sound quality for this price. The best part is if you charge the headphones for just 15 to 20 mins after the battery drains out you can use it for another 1 to 2 hours."
Decent product,4.0,"Sound quality and bass quality is good. It has a passive noise cancellation, not active. The ear phones fits snuggly in the ear, however they sometimes cause a feeling of ear blockage or pressure.Bluetooth connectivity is good. Range about 10-12 feets.Mic quality is not good and one has to repeat multiple times to make other person understand.Overall its a good product, in this price range for active gym goers."
Life ends after warranty ends,2.0,The product is good.. But its life is exactly of 1 year.. I bought 2 of these earphones and both of them stopped working just after the end of warranty period.. I tried to contact the management of boat but they didn't bother to reply
"Should buy at this price range, good bass, battery, & average Bluetooth range",5.0,"Received the package on time.The headphones package is basic.No case which is little disappointing.1.Sound quality is awesome,bass is really nice, sounds is loud.2. Call quality is also nice.3. Bluetooth range is not so good.4. Battery life is awesome. It last for atleast 6hours of music.5. Durability is also nice, as it is also water resistant so a big plus point.A must buy budget headphones at this price range.So a big 5*"
Not upto the expectation,3.0,"It was good at the begening but after using it for 15 days, the sound quality is not that good as expected and and feeling quite distubence in voice.. During the call, sound quality is very poor.. I would suggest choose different brand."
It's only for sound n music lovers not for pubg or gaming,4.0,The sound quality is awsm considering the price range.Bass is superb.Battery backup is awsm.Call quality is up to the mark.Bt only thing i dont like in this earphone is sound delay in pubg.(if it is possible so plz fix it in next model)Ovell all its value for money only for music loversPlz don't buy it for pubg or gaming.
On call receiver at other end will hear noise.. so quality is not up to mark,2.0,"On call receiver at other end will hear noise.. it's very poor quality of this headphone. Lightweight good for music, but not for calls"
"Go for it, you won't regret it.",4.0,"Pros:Best at this price, got this at 999/-Bass is very powerfulRange is also good (around 5 mtrs)Supports Google AssistantSound quality is super richCons:Packaging was not good box was crushed from one side but still ear phones were safeIt will take time to get comfortable with as they only provided 3 size budsAlso there's no fitting clip in the boxWill update more after extensive use."
Damaged product and box. Accessories and warranty card missing,1.0,"Purchased on 14/02/2021. Got this product in damaged product box. There was NOTHING in the box apart from earphones. Cable missing, warranty card missing, extra ear muffs missing. The earphones themselves also feel damaged as the sound is like maxed out auditorium music. It's not at all clear. RETURNING IT RIGHT AWAY"
Awesome wireless earphone,5.0,"Value for money, noise cancellation that you can expect from an earphone, awesome audio quality, weigh less, good bluetooth connectivity, trendy and stylish.  Battery charging is good and lasts promised amount of time."
Amazing sound quality,5.0,"The best sound I've had on any earphones. Totally beats Apple, Skull Candy, and other earphones. The colour and design is beautiful and slinging the earphones around your neck is easy. Bluetooth connection works great. Overall and amazing product. No complaints."
"Good product, avg battery, annoying audio messages",4.0,Audio quality is excellent. But battery back up is average. Charges quickly. The audio messages while connecting and disconnecting are annoying. A simple beep would have been better.
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,2.0,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEMI purchased 3 of these for my bf, my brother & myself..After 1 year of usage all 3 of them stopped functioning on one side which is ridiculous n unacceptable.Total waste of money."
üò≠,3.0,Great product and nice sounds quality . Only cancels noise when on high volumeBut now I have useing from August is now it Nov but the one side of my earphones isn't working where as other is working üò≠
Best in this price range.,4.0,Sound quality and noise cancellation is good. Bass quality is also ok ok not that much i mean when compared with the headphones but still it has good bass quality. Magnets provided are little weak. Overall performance is quit good.  battery life about is 5-6 hours for now as it is new. And charging is quite fast
Earbuds design is disappointing,2.0,"Overall good sound and a very good base, but the biggest issue is the buds support. If you remove these silicon support arch buds this earphone is nothing. Without these support the earplugs slipping out which is very disappointing for me."
Poor Microphone. Not suitable for attending calls.,1.0,Microphone of the product is very poor and noise cancelation doesn't work properly.. Other side of the caller is unable to understand what we are talking. There's no control to adjust the microphone settings or anything. Overall a poor product.
Overall good but bluetooth connectivity has a issue,4.0,Overall it's a 'good' earphone but sometimes it doesn't connect easily with your phone you need to press the button multiple times you even might have to turn it off to connect it to your phone.Noise cancellation bad in case of wind noiseIf there's a strong breeze and you're wearing this earphone you can hear the sound of wind amplified.But that doesn't happen often so it's okay with noise cancellation.
A good purchase if bass is not priority,4.0,Its a very good product for bluetooth.the only thing is the bass is not as same as of boat wired headphones.i had actually used wired ones and i fell in love with bass and then i bought this one expecting the same quality but comparatively its less . Overall the product is good
Value For Money,4.0,"everything works well and considering the price point, it delivers what it claims. Only thing that bothers me is that t's made in China."
6 months review,5.0,"Battery back, noise clarity and noise cancellation is superb of this productHave been using this for 6 months. Full paisaa vasool!"
Below Average Sound Quality And Build But Good Enough At This Price,3.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Bass is low. The LED is almost invisible which is irritating as you have to look for it know if it's on/off/in pairing mode etc.Fitting is average and the material seems to be too cheap."
Its a Happiness box,5.0,"Value for money product.Nice built quality.Sound is awesome, bass is also too good.My battery lasts around 3-4 hours on loud sound on a full chargeDurable productGo can definitely go for it üëçüèª"
Average product,3.0,"It's noise cancellation isn't very effective. U need to speak loudly for other party to hear your voice. Also, battery goes straight from 100 to 80% and theb to 60% in no time. After this just gives 3-4 warning within 5minutes of play and it'll go off. 60% battery means, it should hold at least for 30-40 mins but it doesn't. Good in terms of bass and sound quality. Overall it's an average product with lots of advertisement and marketing."
Value for money,4.0,Thank you Amazon for getting my order delivered before expected date. The headphone is awesome for music but outside call quality is not good compared to indoor call quality as there is no active noise cancellation.
"Great for calling, watching movies, attending classes,",3.0,"See, if your budget getting an amount which sums up the price of it then sure it's hell of a good deal you'll definitely not regret it!!!And don't worry about the brand try to trust it boat has got some amazing stuff and this up one is pretty good I've been using it!!"
"Good sound, better than level u.",4.0,"Earphones are good, bass is very high, you have to adjust the bass with equalizer if your phone supports. Else keep volume at 70% , sound quality is much better than Samsung level u.I received a package which was replaced as the seal on the box was open. Didn't expected Amazon will do this."
Charging port not working,1.0,The Charging port is not working after just 2-3 months. Even the product was under warranty still BOAT haven't provided me with a replacement after so many regular complaint with Amazon and BOAT even after  the ticket is registered and then now the warranty period also expires.Really disappointed with the service facilities.
Claim Warranty,1.0,"To claim warrantyI want to claim warranty....I ve issue on my wireless bluetooth headset,It was not charging and working from last 4Days"
Utter disappointment,1.0,"It's not a joke. It's just a scrap product . Don't know whether I received is a duplicate piece. Because I own boat rockers 600, which is a seamless product from boat. But this purchase irritated me alot and finally I returned it."
Overall very good üëç,5.0,Good noise cancellation..and sound.....one draw baw is that the music does not stop if you remove from ear and stick to the magnetic buds like one plus budsBut sound quality better than OnePlus Z earphones.
poor product with overpriced price.,1.0,no noise cancellation! people on the other end are always complaining of background sounds and noises.it's very embarassing to buy a 1400 rs earphone and then ppl complainig of background noises.
"Great for music, not for calling!",4.0,"Reviewing the product after several months of use.Amazing set of earphones in this price range. Gives you 100% noise cancelation with powerful base and long lasting battery backup (lasts upto 8hrs of continuous usage).Great option for music lovers.Not worth for calling purposes, as the background noise is more than your own voise to the caller on the other side, It's very annoying."
Best for Bass lovers,5.0,"This product is specially for bass lovers, trouble is average . If you want balanced sound then you can use equaliser app to balance bass and trouble .Overall all best product. ..."
Ok Ok,3.0,"Good product but the feel of plastic is very poor, very hard material I am not using this anymore after first 1/2 days use. 3 stars for this brand being Indian"
Only good thing is the battery life,4.0,"If you are looking for long lasting battery life then go for it. Once you are outside and if you do a full volume, still one can the noise of the outside."
"Don't buy, very poor battery",1.0,"Don't buy.In less than 2 months, the battery has given up. It doeebt work if not wired to the charger.While it says longer usage battery, use time is only 2 hours. Which is not sufficient for office or personal use.Very poor product and i am unable to claim warranty"

Worth for 1299rs not more than that,5.0,I got this earphone for 949 RS. It is worth for price. Sound quality is very good and bass is also very much high. And design and color is also very attractive. it is little bit uncomfortable for running. Because of very long size its bounced while running.Good for gym and crossfit workout. You can buy upto 1299 RS.
Big time cheaters,1.0,"Twice the product after a months use started showing problem..1st time a replacement was provided, but 2nd time they took the product but refused to replace the product..money lost and no one even responding on emails or customer care number..worst customer service..STAY AWAY... rather buy a known brand like Sony, Bose, who shall care of their reputation"
After 40% power automatically shutdown headphones.,3.0,Charging speed is best. But after battery remaining 40% it will be automatically shutdown. I can't use 100%. Continuously 6/8 hours backup.  Sound quality is high.
Gud one buy it if u have this price budget not higher,3.0,Lets see noise cancelation is not actually great sound quality is okay. Battery power is also 3 star gud mic not actually high so other person might complain ones or so. But in this price its kinda gud
It is a good product and worth if buy in offers. Medium level product.,3.0,Very good decent product after two week using. It is decent buy during offers. Its a medium level product. But one thing that I noticed is sometime there is lag problem regarding the audio and video in while using YouTube and instagram. It's battery capacity is nice. My rating is 3.5/5

"Great product, Value for money",5.0,Great product. good base. Good sound quality.Works well even if you're sitting in a different room from the phone which is connected.I usually use these to listen to movies and watch shows.Wouldn't be suitable to exercise as the plugs keep coming out.
"Good bass, suppressed high pitch, low Bluetooth connectivity.",3.0,"Got this product at 999 in salePros.1) neon colour is very good2) u can charge this once every two days.3) sound is good, bass is more punched.Cons.1) the product box was damaged so replaced it.2) packaging was not good, Amazon disappointed me this time.3) if u have a high end phone than Bluetooth connectivity is good or else it may lag or latency will be there."
"Good product, too much bass",4.0,"It's a good product, easy to use, everything as described by seller. Battery backup is good too. Just the bass is a little heavy.. it overpowers all other sounds. Would recommend if you are a bass lover."
Not good for calling,1.0,I would give full marks to the sound and bass quality. But the earphones struggle with the calling services. Sometimes the caller does hear the voice and there is lot of delay and that is really annoying and irritating. Unsatisfied while using the earphones while calling and won't recommend for that
Excellent..,5.0,"Using it for 3 months. good battery, lasts for 3-4 hours for continuous usage. easy to charge. with limited usage only for calls battery lasts for 2-3 days."
Bass is as same as in 255f little bit diffrence only.,4.0,"Best batttery backup.Bass is loud.Vocals is also Clear.But not too much diffrent as compared toRockerz 255f,Only a little bit diffrence in sound quality only.Diffrent is only for battery life and charging time."
Not Satisfied.,3.0,"I'm just mentioning the cons,During meeting, other person keeps complained like 'Not Clear' or 'Noisy'.It's always slipping from the ear and it is frustrating. but it may not be the product issue."
Great one at this price range,4.0,At this price range i think this one of the finest headset available in market at present. Easily runs for 5-6houra in single charge. Voice call quality is nice. Music quality is satisfactory. Bass level is not that great but it can be adjusted using equaliser so its a great piece. Go for it. Its deserves value for money tag definitely.

Superb bass and sound quality. So, I would recommend to buy it."
Quality,5.0,"Great product.. easy to use. The best part is you can easily run , jog , talk on the phn wearing this .Sound  quality is good aswell. Value for money i must say. If you are looking for a decent looking headphone go for it. üëç"
GOOD TO USE !!!!,4.0,"I brought it on nov 2019 i am still using it , it has wonderful powerbacked sound and music. but recently i had issue in hearing ,sometimes it has hd sound and sometimes it changes to auto quality but to be frank i am using it daily for past 6 - 9 months it has good quality although china made or orgin"
Poor product and poor after sales service,1.0,Overall poor product. It didn't charged from day 1. It was as useless for me. Now the company has taken back the product in the name of warranty and is not giving me back my original product. Their so called phone number does not work. So if you are looking for after sales service dont go for it. It's a total harrasmsment. I would give 0/5. Poor service and poor product as well.
Not recommend for longer run,2.0,The audio quality is decent but they dont work for longer period of time max 6 to 7 months then the left earphone stops working or the audio quality drops I exchanged it onece and the replacement i got also started showing the same problem. Won't recommend to buy if you want to use it  longer-term
Bad experience,1.0,Ear phones best in terms of battery life but in terms of sound quality not worth it . I think if needed best sound quality and prefer some other products in same price with good sound quality. .... right side ear phones keep on making sounds of buzz buzz while playing songs that's really irritate.
Battery life super duper. I prefer it on 10oct and get on 11 oct..,5.0,The product is super awesome !!!Main feature is  battery i used it 100% to 20% from 11oct21 ti 21oct 2021.Charge is fast.. Super duper hit battery. Bass is jabardast... Overall  quality good. Only defeat i got is charging cable is not working üò∂.. Other product is great ..
I would use another headphones of boat,5.0,"I have bought this product in 2020 for the online class and for playing certain games, I m writing the review after using it for one successfull year.  No problem at all. Best performance. I bought it for ‚Çπ 999.  Ankitkr_0431 ..... Can contact me for more details for this."
Issue with second phone connection,3.0,"Overall it‚Äôs a good headset if you connect to one phone, but if you would like to use it for your second phone, then it has a bug it seems, it keep announcing your connection status with other phone, it‚Äôs very irritating, especially while your in calls"
Good one,5.0,If u want noise cancellation in the background while in phone than don't go for it... except this everything is fantastic
If you buy like me In Rs 1199/- then it's best.,4.0,Yup I like this.  But packet was damaged or maybe someone open the packet. I want to make a review and unblocking video for my YouTube channel. For my pointer view this was not good. (Packet damaged or open)
Boat product support rocks .,5.0,Value for Money .Infact i availaled hassle free warranty  after 10 months use . Device's one side stopped working after 10 months of rigorous  use for music for workout and long calls  .BOAT Customer care issued  new replacment product after receiving  defective  product via courier.
Bluetooth Fail,1.0,"Extremely disappointed.I could not connect the earphones to any of my devices - laptop, ipad, mobile - nothing. So I have no idea of its sound or bass or durability. It seems Boat has increased their expenditure on marketing and have compromised quality."
Cheap quality Chinese product,1.0,"Extremely cheap quality Chinese product. It didn't work for even 10 days. I had bought Tagg inferno two years back which had better sound quality than this and once it stopped working during the warranty period, they promptly replaced it. These guys keep on directing to some stores nearby which I am finding it difficult to visit during this period."
Satisfactory,4.0,"So far so good for 2 days. Let's C how long the performance will remain consistent.Easy bluetooth connectivity.Bought it at Rs. 1300 which I feel little high, should have been upto Rs. 1000."
Overall best product & worth buying @ this price range,5.0,"The sound quality is very very Good @ this price range, bass quality is also Good, battery back up is also very good but while receiving or dialling the calls the sound quality is not that good but still ok. I recommend this product as worth buying, apart from calls I liked this product very much."
I Really Like this Bluetooth Earphone.,5.0,Everything is perfect.I Really Like this Bluetooth Earphone. Everything is perfect. 3D supports and Nice Bass supports. And i like the Voice of this headphone. I Love boAt company i hope your company raise to the top. and please don't make the earphone price too high this prices are perfect.
Good sound with less durability,3.0,"The sound quality of the earphone is good. The base and the noise cancellation is commentable. But I am not Satisfied with the products durability, just usage of 6 months and one side of it is not working. I really am a BOAT fan, but this product didn't survive as per it's name and money. You will find better earphones in same price range or you may have to Shell out a little bit more. Overall rating is just above average for this earphones just because of the durability."
Weak Battery Life,1.0,Weak Battery can ruin all the fun. The product I received is good but I can't enjoy using this product for more than 40 minutes.Battery gets both drained and charged quickly.There's no point of selling this product if Company cannot provide a good battery life.
Extremely poor built quality and pathetic support team,1.0,Built quality of this product is very poor. The wire regularly gets detached from microphone box.After use of few months only one side speaker stopped working.Boat does not have pick up and drop facility for device after they get damaged.My advice is to avoid this product and go for some superior brand
Awesome Bluetooth Earphones,5.0,These set of earphones are the best ones available in market at such a competitive price. Go for it guys!!! Have been using it since more than a year now and have gifted it to my family members.
Real Review after using it after 2+ months.,4.0,I have been using it from 2 months. Overall it is good battery backup is good use it for allday on one charge no problem. But noise cancellation is very poor for that I am upset with boat. In built Mic is good for meetings and video conferences. It is budget earphones the best thing I love is battery backup.
Don't buy.,1.0,Within 6 months of my purchase the head phone stopped working.i wrote to the customer care .after 15 days they asked me to return the product.then immediately i returned the product for replacement.after that did not respond at all.they are not responding to mail and phone calls.pathetic customer care.dont go for the product.
It's not working after few days.,1.0,This is the worst product which I purchased it was not working and wasn't connecting to any device bcoz red and blue both light used to blink.. I raised a complaint and they took for replacement and said replacement done and sent the same product by doing neat polish .after replacement also not working trying to reach boad customer care but no response.. don't by this product..
Headset wire Got wear and tear due to curled packaging by boAt.overall the best in class.,4.0,"BoAt packaging is worst. The headset wire  got wear and tear ,and bend due to rough packaging.You can clearly hear the sounds of instruments during music but human voice is not clear... It is better if the makers avoid beep sound during volume adjustment..... The headset wire starting from the end of neck band can be avoided...better if it comes out little bit away from the tips..like in the Boult headset... overall it's okay"
Go for it....,1.0,"This is going to be a honest review about boat neckband,first I want to mention here that the base and the sound both amalgamation  is awesome and this is the best product I have ever bought from anyother brand . Super battery backup superb sound quality superb build quality this is like a one stop package for anyone."
Perfect for music and daily use. Its a great product by boAt.,5.0,"I would like to recommend this product under 1500/-,i bought this in 1200/-. You will not regret if you buy for 1500/-, sound quality is awesome the bass is perfect. Battery backup is said for 6 hours but you can use 10-12 hours for calls and some time of music or movie too.I use to listen the music for 45-50 min and a YouTube for 3-4 hours a day. It long last from 8am to 8pm sometime you need to charge it for 10-15 mins it longs last for an hour or more."
Good product.,4.0,Product is good. But I found it a bit discomforting while long hours. The ears would start to pain if you use it with the ear loops. Sound quality is good and bass too. Clarity could have been a bit better and notice cancellation is okay okay type.
Stopped working after six month.,1.0,"Everything was fine:-  sound quality, noise cancellation etc for about six months.It stopped working from one side after six month only and after a few days from both the sides.During the lockdown period in April 2020 it has stopped working so can't exchange them right now. I have to wait."
Stopped working after 6 Months,3.0,"I have purched Boat Rockers bluetooth headset on July 2019, looks good in build quality, but it stops working now. There is physical tampering or crushing . three days before leftside Ear phone stopped and today right side also stopped working. I have used very carefully this headphone. Really disappointed. Not recommending to anyone."
Dissapointed on diwali,1.0,"Worked like for 5 mins then it stopped. Light is not blinking, no lights at all . Tried to charge it but that also didn‚Äôt workout too.. packaging was terrible and the box was also damaged. They are supposed to send these items in a box but all they had was a bag of plastic without any bubble wrap. The seal looked like someone has opened it. Huge disappointment on the occasion of diwali. üòë"
Disappointed!!! Very poor battery life.,1.0,"I have purchased these earphones after reading all positives responses. But I had issue with battery life. The battery life is very poor. When I connected bluetooth, that time battery shown as 80%. After 20 mins it got disconnected due to low battery. And this happened every day. So within 3 days I returned it. I am regular & prime member of the Amazon. So, I am not expecting this type of product from Amazon."
Bad quality mic but good sound,3.0,Perfect sound quality and really good bass.No lag while playing pubg.  Pubg mobile sound experience was unreal  Only problem with this earphones is mic. Bad quality mic.  It's only good for listening music.
Didn't last long,3.0,Hardware quality is not good. Exactly it worked for 1 year. Warranty is over and product was not working.
3rd class Service center,2.0,This product is 2 time service in a year but service center resend to customer after 2 months.so boat service center is very third class service center.
Nice product,4.0,"Sound quality, noise cancellation and base quality is satisfactory. Battery is good,  Only battery backup fall down suddenly after some hour use, battery indicator shows 70-80 percent. I think it is software problem."
Review after 5 days of use,5.0,"Excllnt prdct , was hesitant to buy but it was superb choice ...exllnt battery backup , music is awesome spl the bass , links to 2 devices simultaneously and smoothly , call quality superb...good buy..."
"Average product, not as good as advertised",2.0,"I used this product for 15 days, had issues with bluetooth connectivity, had to keep on restarting the product to connect to multiple devices. Battery works like around 5-6 hrs max, charges quickly though{using fast charger}. Mic is not stable, has a lot of noises for the other person to hear you. Sound quality is good."
Noise Cancellation amazing but Loose Ear Grip.,4.0,"Noise Cancellation is amazing. But a little loose to fit in the ears. Grip is less , falls down from ears. Bass is awesome. And got Extra pair of Ear Plugs as well. Good product. Been a month using it and still works awesome. The wires are amazing so won't be damaged soon."
Wireless Earphone,4.0,Liked the look and sound quality. Does not fall out of your ears during exercise. Got it for ‚Çπ999/- from the Prime Sale with ‚Çπ199/- cashback.

I Like it.,5.0,"First impressions with one day usage.Pros :--1. Extra Bass.2. Battery (got around 8 hours from out of the box without charging even once)3. Good connection.4. Comfortable.Cons :--1. Build quality.2. Wires are little bit long.Go for it if you are looking at Bluetooth Earphones under 1.5k. I got it for 1,299/- rupees."
Waste of money,1.0,I am giving review after 18 days of purchase . After 18 days it takes almost 2 hoursto full get full charge and gets discharge in 4 hours only but in specification it is given that it gets full charge in 20 minutes and long last for 8 hour . Very bad quality of boat . Waste of money.
Bad Product ; avoid it,1.0,The blue tooth link keeps breaking. Replacement was given which was worse than the one sent earlier and was obviously a used one
Not That much Good,3.0,"Yaa,product quality is not that much Good,it was showing the Bluetooth range is approximately 10metre but in my case it is working well within a range of 3/4 metre,if I go beyond this range the music/Calling quality is very bad.I don't know why the company like Boat having this much poor music Quality,But is doesn't satisfy value for money.Thank you..üòüüòüüòüüòü"
Good or Bad,4.0,Second day review (Good and Bad)I have bought this but I have some problems..1) when the phone calls come it will be slow receiving2)And it is air pressure problem also3) It is best but not much more better than pro 225F4) And If phone well kept 10 meters it well performers well struck the song
Go for it without a doubt.,4.0,"I think the best sound, I have JBL too but these are way better.Going to order the 3rd one now. Gifted the other two.Slight problem with bluetooth connectivity over wifi. But with data it's really good and very good battery life."
Poor quality of wire,1.0,The wire of one side broke internally just after 5 months. Quality of material is really very poor. I'll not recommend this to others.
"Good product, must buy.",5.0,"I bought this today, it's sound quality is awesome but bass is not so deep which I expected. In bass out of 10 I give it 7 . But sound quality is too good. Must buy. Not highly recommended for bass lovers.Battery backup is also very good. Durability , ipx technology are also very good. Impressive product from boat. Buy this.üôÇüëçüëçüôÇ"
Product is Not bad one but service is disgusting,3.0,"Basically I'm a fan of boAt, I'm using boat heads to rockerz, now I'm disappointed with the Boat rockerz 255pro, with in one month after buying i have noticed right earphone is giving less sound compared to left of, which causing imbalanced sound üò≠üò≠ even i have raised complaint against it, but still i they didn't responded."

Average product; Too hyped,4.0,"An average product or NOT worth for Rs.999/-. The maker doesn't know how to fix the control of bass and treble. However, my son enjoying it; because his favourite teacher owns the same."
Not good for gaming,4.0,"Excellent headphone for calls and music. But if you are gamer, you will face issue of sound. As it is bluetooth device, you will get sound delay by .5 sec. Like when i play pubg using this headphone, I get sound delay. So sometimes its difficult to spot any enemy in close range. No issue with headphone, it is because of bluetooth connectivity. And you gonna face this issue in every bluetooth headset. So go for wired if gaming your priority."
One side of earphone is not working(Also another quality seems very very bad),1.0,"One side of earphone is not working, Also another quality seems very very bad,No Noise cancellation, sound & bass quality is also very bad, Magnetic lock is very loose,Compare with another same earphone seem very much difference  earphone code seems missing,This earphones seems duplicate with all the aspect."
Don‚Äôt buy,4.0,I bought it 6 months back..till now it worked properly but the battery capacity is low..from this week onwards connection is very weak and the sound is not Audible due to weak connection
Okay product.,2.0,The product is good but the bass isn't upto mark plus it's not working now. It's just been1.5 months and one side of the earphone isn't working all of sudden. Since warranty period expired couldn't do anything.
Air Bard Couson and charging port very poor,4.0,Deeply sound but all the music contant not come property.Over all good sound.My personal rating 4/5.
Worst Product and Service.Don't Buy it.,1.0,I just bought this earphone 4 months back.One side of my earphone is not working now.I have already registered a complaint about this so many times in boat Service team but it was not resolved still now. The service is worst in boat. So please don't buy it.They told me they replace the product within 2 weeks but they didn't do anything. Don't Prefer this Boat at all...Very worst one I have ever seen.
Harmful for ears.,1.0,Bought at 1000 RS. Ears get warmer within few minutes. Harmful for ears . Rather use wired or costly wireless headphones. Don't go for cheap wireless options and prevent ur ears from getting damaged.
My opinion,5.0,"This was basically something that I really loved to have on my ears since many days so this product is very satisfying to me.Every product has a flaw so you can find them in others' reviews. Personally, I loved it. The sound, the model, the look, the charging facility, everything is nice. You can go for it. Keep it safe for it to last longer."
Disappointed,2.0,"Returned the earphones. Shoddy and unappealing, replaced with Sony which is costlier but a whole lot better."
Good product but quality should be improve,3.0,Quality of this product under 1400 se good but some time it's just stop working and again startng workng after some time I don't know what's the problem other wise battery is good  6 hour of play back ..
Wow impressed much,5.0,"Very well made product. I would rate it 10 on 10.The earphones are designed in such a way, that u can use them while running and cycling as well and WOW!!! They dont come off the ear.I am very impresses and would definitely recommend this product to everyone."
"Not ""Tikao"" type",1.0,"Don't buy any boat product. Sound quality good but not ""tikao"" type. You'll face problem shortly.  Bought it on October 2019. Defected within 5 months (charging issue). Replaced as it was within warranty period. The new item became damaged after 8 months, now connectivity issue: not connecting to any mobile ."
Worth its value,5.0,"The pair very good for talking which is my prime concern, light warm music, casual gaming also was in stack. So its doesn't disappoint me either on those aspect well. The big question is battary back, which I can say in between 3 4 hours if continuous use. Its fully loaded under a 1I price, true value for money."
Good in this price range,5.0,Best in this price range. Bass is very good. Sound quality and build quality are also good. You can go for it if you are looking for a Bluetooth neckband under 1500. It's very comfortable. Extra eartips are also given for comfort according to your size. The only thing that I found bad is its not USB type-C. Otherwise it's magnificent
first copy received in 2019 sale,1.0,"I purchased boat rockersz 255 during 2018 and that impressed me the design and sound quality. I brought one more during this 2019 sale for 899 Rs.  but there is a big difference in both the products. First of all when it connects it should say ""You are connected to Boat Rockersz 255""  but 2019 sale product skipping "" 255"". looks like it is first copy."
Don't buy it,1.0,"Worst product.Not easy to handle. Length of wire is soooo long.. someone can easily snatch it.. quality of buds is very low.. Go for syska or other product. boAt is worst.. and it is made in china... I came to know it after reading every line carefully. They Print Mumbai address in bold.. which is only ""marketed by"".."
Nice noise cancellation for the price with magnetic eartips!!,4.0,"Pros:Nice Noise cancellation for a bt at the priceMagnetic eartipsCall quality is good with noise calculationNice bass for a bt headset at the pricePretty convenient while commuting because it's a bt headsetCons:If u r thinking about playing Pubg on it, then forget it. It's mic doesn't work with Pubg and voice is very low.Not the best sound quality at 1500 because it's a Bluetooth headsetOk battery lifeWires slightly longer than what's convenient"
Very very poor performance,1.0,Very pathetic product with very very low audio and no bass while listening to music and after 8 days MIC also stopped workingCan anyone help me where to reach out these boat peopl6 to get the problem fixed
"Good, but can be made better.",4.0,"Good Product. Serves the purpose.Bass is not upto the mark, when  the ""hype"" in advertisement of the product is considered.Surely not a ""pro"" product as per my wish."
Satisfied,4.0,No complaint. Good noise cancellation. Battery back up is also good till now. Fast charging too. Purchasing in deal is better otherwise costly.
Disappointed,2.0,"Whenever I conference calls it does not connect with the other calls, if I use a wired earphones I am able to conference, i need a replacement. Once its replaced and fixed Ill change the overall reviews."
Sound is bassy.,4.0,Sound quality is good. Really on bass side. If you want stereo clarity not baasy then it's not for you. Little disappoint on the charger wire which doesn't work . Giving 4 star for the charging cable.
Voice is  verey lesss,2.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†This is the product i received from amazon. Really disappointed of  MeI think  These product is swimmed in Hyderabad floods  Because it is fully bathed not working any  Bit"
Not Happy.,1.0,Bought this product on 7th June this year and in two months time the sound of the left earphone is not working. Such a pity. Great product poor performance.
Suddenly switched off battery.  Don't trust this product.  Noy came charging properly..,1.0,Very bad product.  Immediately charges gone.  Not showing battery charging. Suddenly switched off. It's wasted product. Only name is big brand but use this product. Don't trust any one this product. Dont buying this product..
It's an average kind of product,4.0,"I like price component, what I don't like is sound quality is not so good, bass too not upto mark.For that price range it's a decent product"
Not satisfied fully,2.0,"The product is only good for listening music, not meant for phone calls, there is lot of noise to the other person. Voice quality is very slow and poor to the other person over the call. cannot be used for phone calls at all. i feel it is over price for a single use of listening music or watching videos, better products are available in the market at much cheaper prices. i guess the prices is double its selling price on amazon."
Review after one month of usage,3.0,"Comprehensive review:-1. Noise cancellation is just pathetic, it does not work in rush area.2. Connection breakage problem is common and I am facing the same after using this in two devices.3. Pathetic customer service"
Not for bass lovers at all,1.0,As a bass lover i would like to say it is weak..They say it has super extra bass i say it doesnt even have good bass trust me bass is not good at all im a bass lover. Vocals are ok mic distorts. Voice is ok. Seriously if u love bass buy nu republic jaxx 3 instead of these they are far better for bass lovers plus vocals are also better i have used jaxx 3 also.

Best battery backup,5.0,"The best thing is it's battery...I used this for almost 1week in single charge. .And then immediately bought another one for my son..highly recommended at this price point..Those , who uses this for 4/5 hrs a day, this will go beyond 1 week in single charge."
Perfect one,5.0,"Writing this review after using the product over a month.. One of the best at its price.. Good sound quality and noise cancellation also does its job perfectly.. And the highlight of the product obviously its battery backup, just nailed .Great battery backup"
A good Earphone in this Price.,5.0,Earphone quality is good with a strong magnetic lock. The straps are of good quality and the earphone wires are too good. Buttons' quality is good. The sound is full of punchy bass and balanced treble and has to surround effect. Good fitting to the ears. Likewise perfect. Worth price for Money. Thank you for reading. Cheers!!!
Awesome product,5.0,"The headset are awesome, bass is good, sound is very clear. Connects to mobile, laptop, tab and TV instantly. Value for money and a must buy if someone is looking for budget headsets."
Good Bluetooth headphones for average price,4.0,"It's sturdy, sound quality is good, sound levels are also good, the mic is decent enough too for phonecalls. The only thing I dislike is that it's not very flexible. It will not fit in your jeans pocket."
No Mute option but product is good,3.0,"Don‚Äôt buy if you want mute option.. all is good but without mute option I can‚Äôt use this for daily purpose .I can‚Äôt even return it,But yes it‚Äôs good product no doubt. It would have been good if I would have got returned and got another boat one or other brands"
Just Go for it.,5.0,I got to know about this bluetooth earphones from a friend and got recommended by him. So its been 20 days since using and I could say that it is actually really good
Happy with it,5.0,"As expected, a good product from Boat. Worth buying. Not the best but the sound quality is good and build quality is good too. If you are getting it in Rs.1299 or below just go for it without any second thought."
Not working after 5 months of usage,2.0,One side not working after 5 months of usage i.e. today. Lets see how's the warranty claim process. Will update soon.
Cheap quality at high price,1.0,"Product is not comfortable on ear, Bluetooth pairing is disconnecting frequently , fed up of this quality, local Bluetooth headphone is far better as compared to this head phone."
Not recommended,1.0,Left side of the headphones volume coming is very less. Not giving a complete bass experience. The product is not recommended as Bluetooth support is low the phone needs to be in nearest range itself. I picked up from amazon coz I didnt expected a duplicate product like wht I hv gt.
Good product,4.0,"Rated it 4 stars only because of one reason. While being on a call at a noisy place, the person on the other side experiences a lot of noise. Similarly, while recording sound, it catches a lot of noise from the environment.Otherwise very convenient because of being wireless."
Great experience in low price,5.0,"The earphones are awesome. Sound is great. No one complained me about my voice on call. So, mic is great as well. 2 devices are getting connected easily. Battery backup is good. Overall a value to money paid deal."
Product is awesome..‚òëÔ∏è but WORST PACKAGING by AMAZON,1.0,Product is awesome.. clear sound quality and built quality.. product is as mentioned..But the packaging quality is very worst by amazon..Wire in headset got slightly damaged in few places boz of irresponsible packaging by amazon..WORST PACKAGING by amazon..
Better Not best...!!,4.0,Battery life - TerrificIts bass is good... Sound quality is good ...Wire of this bluetooth is extra long its make it a lil uncomfortable.. Magnet power of this buletooth is sucks... Its magnet can't work like oneplus n realme.. earbuds gives pain in ear sometime.....!!!!!!!!!! 3.5‚≠ê
"Sound Quality, Build, Functions",4.0,"sound quality: heavy bass, the vocals and instrumentals are a little drowned out by this. But I prefer heavy bass for workouts.build: build is pretty good and flexible.  it has a frame which goes around the neck, this can be kind of annoying when running or jumping, but i just tuck it underneath my shirt.  the eartips havent fallen out yet, they are a great fit.function: just a reminder that to change tracks u have to hold down volume up and down keys, double tapping middle button actually calls the previous person you called."
Good But,3.0,"Earphones is Good Sound Quality and Very Long Battery But Length is little bit long and This is Neck Band Model,  I don't like Neck Band Type Like Cable Type"
Read it first !!,4.0,The only thing I don't like about this neckband is that they sounds very loud when u turn them on while plugged in ur ears üòñüòñnd u cannot turn their volume up or down they r still at their max vol nd one more thing that they missed is that it doesn't show any vibration while incoming callüôÅ bt over all sound quality is best in this range
Awesome,5.0,"I am using this earphone for calling and I found listener has received crystal clear voice .While using to listen music , bass is very good and sound quality is pretty good on 2 step down from high volume .Overall very good product , recommended for calling and music ."
Sound quality is not good,1.0,Sound quality is very bad. Not sure if I received faulty one. 'power ON' message had disturbance and hence returning this product.
Battery or hardware issue !,1.0,After using for 2 days when the battery got fully drained i kept it on chargin.Now it doesnt turns on after chargin is disconnected.but it turns  on and off while connected to charging.Bad piece of hardware which couldnt stand for even 2 days.Not a good experience for sure.If others are facing the same donot buy!
Best at 999 value for money,4.0,Amazing product got it on sale at 999 rs affordable at this price point sound quality is good battery backup 3.5-4hours depend on volumeElse wire quality aur improve ho sakti thi to acha hota else is everything is good
GOOD BASS,4.0,"If you like bass in every music you hear, then this is the go-to option which is worth every penny you spend. It's okay for everyday use if not great and the battery backup is awesome. So for a budget Bluetooth headset, this is an awesome option."
Cheap & best,3.0,Overall good but as of today's technology no voice cancellation for this price it's best choice..and importantly made in india need to encourage indian products
Wow really it's a nice neckband,5.0,"Really it's a nice neckband... sound quality is very nice and battery backup is so good...it's around one week in a single charge with listen music, watching movies and talking....worth buying in this price .. please go for it"
Not worth 999 rs,4.0,The product do not comes with item box case which i got when i purchased it from other e commerce site.... The discount was good but the sound quality is poor.  Overall not a gokd deal for 1k price.
Cannot rely on durability..It's worst,1.0,Battery life is good . I don't know suddenly it started to fully charged but when tried to power on its not working. It's only 1 month I hardly used it and it's gone no use now . Totally waste of money . I recommend not to buy
It's price range was so high,3.0,Sound quality was good but not best.Not good  for Playing pubg .I Allready exchange for fault in left earphone
Horrible product,1.0,"Horrible product. I think it is defective. I was waiting, thinking i am using it wrong but there is always a slight disturbance in the audio when i connect to a zoom or google meet call. I've stopped using it. If it can be returned, I would request you to contact me. Waste of money."
Awesome product,5.0,"I didn't expected too much at this price range but I ordered it.But Sound quality is awesome .Bass is also superb. battery life is also good. I have used for 4 hours approximately but not charged once.Very easy to use.Easily connects to my mi phone and ipad.Go for it.And at last, packaging and transport is good reached before time"
Best in the budget.,4.0,The sound quality for a bt earplugs on this budget is quite decent. If you get it less than ‚Çπ1500 then you should go for this. Best product in this budget.If you are a bass lover then you gonna love this. Also for calling and stuff it has got a mic which i quite good and gives a decent output to the callers even if you are driving.
Quality,5.0,Worst product I have ever received from amazon. Within 2 month It get damaged. Left ear has no sound. When I have gone to service centre there also no replacement available. They are telling wait for 8-10 days. Does it make any sense. What can I do without headphone for 8-10 days. I have taken for official and personal work. Now all the work has damage. Beacause of this worst product
Bluetooth earphone,5.0,"A tiny tool, comfortable to wear, good sound quality helped me a lot in tele consultationWould have liked more if the battery life had been 10 to 12 hours instead of 4 to 6 hours"
Budget Earphone,4.0,Overall experience has been good at this price range. I have been using it for more than 8 months and performance is consistent. Only thing battery back up has reduced.
Best in class product,5.0,1. The earbuds are super comfortable( i had it plugged for 8 straight hours and didn't feel any discomfort)2. Charge is amazing.lasts almost 8 hours.3. Charges in 1:30 hours.4. Durable5. Mic is way better than boat basshead 2256. connected device should be near the earphones.
Waste of money (overpriced),1.0,Pro: As a earphone they are really great. Great great noise cancellation and sound.Con: I bought these in october 2019 and in April 2020 they stopped working. I mean I did not spend ‚Çπ900 to use them for 6 months. Even ‚Çπ50 fake earphones has longer lifeline.
Overall it's a good product,4.0,Sound quality is good .. noise cancellation preety well and bass quality ok.. battery life is also good to use for 3 to 4 continues hour..and it's get quick charge also
Remember one thing the model number is boat rockerz 255+,5.0,It's surprising me with the battery backupüò≥. One time you charge it then you just forget about charging matter. Bass is nicely balanced. Most important thing is that this headphone's sound is so comfortable ü•∞I just loved that‡•§ Remember one thing the model name is boat rockerz 255 pro+
If you're buying this only for calling then definitely it's a wrong buy.,3.0,"All other features are good except the Bluetooth connectivity. The Bluetooth connectivity is very poor and the range of the bluetooth is not at all good, you will understand this when you make a call. Leave your phone while talking and walk for some distance the voice will start breaking and the person who is on a call will not be able to hear you.If you're buying this only for calling then definitely it's a wrong buy."
Good,5.0,"It is a good earphone, gets connected quickly, although noice cancellation is a little less (don't know if it's because it doesn't fit my ears properly) anyway, good quality for the price, although i expected the battery to last a little longer.Over-all good one"
Not durable.,1.0,"Bought the product and after finding the sound quality better, recommended the same to my friends. But after few months found the product is not durable and would stop working after 4-5 months. Addition to this, the Customer Care Services are third class. No pick and drop services. No prompt solutions."
Superb,5.0,"Very good sound quality. Loud bass, I really loved this product. Only negative is the product is bog in size and not much attractive, could  have made little more stylish"
Battery life is not at all good,1.0,After 8 months of use battery life is remaining only two hours....so disappointing with product. My friend has redmi bluetooth headset before me and still performance as it is. And both have same price. Not atall recommended.
Waste of money don't go for it,1.0,Never go for this product all other reviews are fakeAs they all get money for reviewing fakeThis product is waste of moneySound quality is not goodAnd if u want to return it they will refuse to return it . Don't ever go for this product
COULDN'T GET BETTER EARPHONES IN 999!!!,4.0,*The noise cancellation and sound quality is perfect. It has deep immersive base.*The build quality is outstanding along with the neck band.*Decent Battery lifeI couldn't get a better in-ear bluetooth headsets since I got it for Rs.999 in a saleTHE PACKING COULD BE IMPROVED THINKING THAT IT IS A 1.5K WORTH HEADSET!!
Check out with people who use these type earphones,1.0,Very disappointed with Amazon. The product doesnot suit me. It hurts my ears and hence was requesting for return and refund. But I was only provided with replacement policy that to with a same product again when I mentioned why I am trying to return the same. Really disappointed.
Decent earphones considering price range,4.0,"After 1 year of heavy use they're going great, but after 8 months i had to replace battery because it got swollen, otherwise these are good, and sound quality is pretty decent too.They run for 4-5 hrs in one charge at 75% volume."

Satisfactory,4.0,Bought this product for ‚Çπ1099 and the product is living upto the expectation. The sound is fair and the bass quality is pretty good. Does the job and well Boat has a reputation to carry forth.Thank you for the super fast dilivery and hopefully the experience will remain smooth.
Worst earphones,1.0,I bought 2 same earphones and both of those got stopped working just after a year when the product is just out of the warranty. So it worked only in warranty period which is after a year. Same case I heard from my friend.Worst earphones!!!
Ok product,2.0,"After 2months review.. Sound is ok not too much bass, noise cancellation is not much, even after changing buds still it doesn't fit in ear can't use it while jogging. Moreover right side because of two button fixes too much weight falling on it."
Works well in beginning & slowly starts showing it's poor performance,1.0,"When I purchased this product, It was working great.But slowly it started degrading its performance.Battery issue, No noise cancellation, cannot connect Bluetooth immediately.Good for 1-month use and not value for money.I would recommend buying an Rs. 300 products 4 times and use it at least for 4 months.Poor than expected."
Please fix my problem,3.0,The sound quality is gud product is nice but it has some connectivity issues ...like it's not  showing in my tablet which I use the most for my online classes n even I sometimes get confused with on /off prblm as it doesn't show properly whether it is on or off ....Light doesn't blinks properly sometimes red then blue idk what it means bcoz in the manual the instructions are not properly mentioned .......üôÑüôÑü§∑please fix my problem related to tablet
just buy boat rockerz 225 pro,5.0,I got product for 1100 rupee i think so it is more than worth of money nice bass quality nice packing i just happy with charging if i charge for 10 mins i can use upto 2 hrsi love this product  thank you  yours faithfully  amazon prime customer
Overall good product apart from connectivity issue,3.0,"Love the the sound quality and noise cancellation. Even the full charging lasts quite long in playback. But the main drawback i see in this particular product is the connectivity, it tends to pair with multiple devices at same time. I have used two Boat bluetooth speakers in the past but never faced such issue of multiple connectivity."
Poor Noise cancellation,3.0,Noise cancellation not up to the mark.It felt like boat signature sound is degrading.Not happy with the product.Needs improvement.1st time unsatisfied from boat.
"Honest Review for those who have decided ""Jo bhi ho jaye yahi earphone lena hai""",4.0,"The product is super but it is not robust. The earphones does not last long. I bought it on Sep 2018 and replaced it since one earpiece was not working within 4 months of purchase. The customer support is excellent but it takes 20 days time for the overall process. Again after 9 months of puchase, one piece is again not working. Sound quality is awesome. One cons is there that while calling, the other person recieves the sound too loudly any it irritates the receiver."
you get pain if you use it more than an hour,3.0,you get pain if you use it for more than an hour and if you remove that plastic holding buds which is removable then it keeps getting fall down and not comfortable if you are buying it for running of gyming.Better go for ptron which is cheaper and same in quality and much more comfortable in use
Good,4.0,Noice cancellation is for our ear not for the mic.remaining all good in quality especially fast charging and battery superb. But the charging cable of mine stop working after 2 month. But we can adjust with other cables then also it will get charged fast. Overall good purchase.
Scrambled Audio if Wi-Fi is active,4.0,"All good as-far-as u are not on Wi-Fi.If u are on Wi-Fi, u won't be able to hear a thing, scrambled voice.Something wrong, tried it with 2 to 3 sets all same.Other than this issue - all well."
It has connectivity issue.,1.0,"It gets disconnected and connected continuously with my devices. I got replacent against first fauly product but issue is generic and continued in other one. Couldn't perform seamlessly. I have wasted my money because it is not a returnable item, can be exchanged only."
Too much bass. go for realme,3.0,Boat focuses only on enhanced bass not sound clarity. even you set bass to 0 then also you will feel too much bass.i have realme wireless earphone they are way better than this.Realme is also very comfortable as compare to this boat.
Nice bluetooth in ear headphones for the price.,4.0,"I have been using this product for two months now, no complain whatsoever, it has quick charge and the bass is pretty good too. If you are looking for headphones under the roof of 1500, you can go for it. I like the various colour options they have and the built quality is also decent. In an all, best low budget bluetooth headhphone."

Value for money,5.0,"Hey Guys,I bought boAt Rockerz 255 Sports Bluetooth Wireless Earphone & I am completely satisfied with this product. Its really awesome and I am loving this Earphone easy to connect with awesome sound quality. If connected on call it works well and reduce the noise I mean noise cancellation works well. The person I was speaking to cannot identify I was using Earphone. Its value for money."
It's sound is amazing,4.0,I am writing this after using it for 1 weekIt's sound is amazing and nice noise cancellationIt has a good battery backup of 7- 8 hoursIt charges very fastIn less than 1hour it fully chargedOveral it is a nice productValue for money
"Sometimes it does not work, while connected to phone.",3.0,"Sometimes it does not work, while connected to phone for the calls then. Sometimes you receive a call, you get a notification but after accepting the call, bluetooth does not work at that for listening the calls, i have to disable the bluetooth. It happens sometimes."
"Good Product, but not the best",3.0,"your ears starts aching, bud quality is not upto the mark,..Noice cancellation is good, worth for the price, not recommended to those those who take lot of calls..."
Go for it,5.0,"I have at present 3 Bluetooth earphones, which I am impressed with Bluetooth range that is much far than other Bluetooth headset and battery backup.."
Worth of the price,4.0,"It's worth of the price, everything is good. But i am having issue when i connect these to my MI 55 Inch tv, automatically wifi disconnecting everytime. When i am not using earphone with tv it works fine. I think there is a comatibility issue"
"Average Bluetooth ear phones, justify the price of 1K.",3.0,"Average Bluetooth ear phones, justify the price of 1K. If you are looking for convenience and freedom for tangling wire, certainly you can go for it. If you want great sound quality certainly this is not the one."
Not expected such bad product from Boat,2.0,"Pls don't buy this product. Within one month of purchase it's mic stopped working. Since product was in warranty, on taking it to service center they replaced the product, but the issue is recurring even in replaced product immediately after replacement."
Great headphones,5.0,"Excellent product in terms of usability, easy pairing, lightweight and great noise cancellation. Longer battery standby time is also very helpful. Sound quality is nice, all tones are equally heard, no distortions."
Good,5.0,The product is good. This is the second time we have ordered the product.But the only thing is that the charging wire and bluetooth headset color is different. One is red which should have been green.
Awesome earphone i just love itüòçüòç,5.0,"Awesome product and bass is also good.I am happy to use this product before buying this product I'm using wired earphone but when I'm buying this product my overall experience is good.But their is a problem connect problem, Sometimes disconnect automatically when i was calling in too much time.But overall is good at this price."
One side of earphone not working,1.0,It is just 1 year 6 month and now the one side of earphone is not woking. No audio I believe boat needs to work on thier product durability. My normal headphone which less cheaper then boat is working fine from last 2 years.
Writing review after 6 months of use,1.0,Writing review after using it for 6 months. Everything is good but now I facing charging issue with it. So to calim the warranty I registered a complaint on April 20 2020 but till up to date no response from them .I called to the customer number and mailed to there site so many times but response form them. So guys please don't buy this by seeing one year warranty
Sound quality,3.0,I'm writing review using after 2months..This product quality is really good and color was unique and elegant and getting suprb base without noice and it's noice reduction.Bit concerned for me like large cable if they design by reducing to small it would be really awesome
"Not durable, average sound quality",2.0,"Sound quality is not so good and not so bad, I'd say average. Bass is good but not so strong with treble. But the main problem is the durability. In 3 months, battery started draining in an just an hour long usage and also phone calls stopped working. This is the second time I'm having a terrible experience with BOAT earphones, earlier with a different model. I'm really starting to think if they're worth it because of this durability concerns."
"Good earphones, but got faulty in less than 2 months",1.0,"We bought it on 16th July and got it delivered by 18th July. Was easy to set up. I have constant use of headphones in my work and have used multiple bluetooth headphones. But 21st August, one of the earbud stopped working and now both sides have stopped working. Expected it to work for at least one year. Also no place to return the item. What do you expect me to do with a 1000rs non-working headphones? I hope amazon/ the seller / the company replace the item."
Descent product with good quality sound..,4.0,"Did not like the product packaging at all!! The box inside the package wrapping was really in a bad condition.Apart from that, liked the super fast delivery, ordered it yesterday and received it today early morning, the sound quality was also good."
Do not purchase it in sale,2.0,The product which I got is a low quality product I fu as it's been used and they give away it in sale as. If I use it for 2 hrs continuesly the battery drains off after charging it full. I guess this needs to be corrected. And the name on the hearphones has started coming out. Using it from 5 days. Shame on you boat. If possible I would like to give it back and get it refunded.
Stopped working within 12 days of Purchase,1.0,"Hi, I bought this on 5th Feb and it stopped working on 16 Feb 2019. I am chasing people to at least get the item replaced but not sure if they will help on this. On 16th Morning, it neither switches on nor it charges when trying to charge.Very bad to see 2000 rs going in vain.Mohit"
Extremely good at battery life,5.0,"Extremely good at battery life and the sound, I received this product 7 th September with 100% charge today 15 September average everyday playing 5-6 hrs and still 56% charge remain. Bass very good, sounds little low but best for comfort sound."
Sound quality and good bass but very disappointed with battery,2.0,Battery life is very poor it takes around 1.5 to 2hrs to charge but battery backup gives only 3-4hrsSound quality is good and bass ok .If you having a budget of 2k then Better go for New Realme wireless earbuds having fast charge and long battery life backup upto more than 12hrs in a single charge .Realme sound quality is awesome and great bass with 11.2mm driver.
After sales service ZERO,2.0,After sale service zero..No given on Amazon site 022 3014 7239 is in valid...The soft ear buds & two clone which holds on ears fail off.. other wise the performance is ok ..
Headset stopped working in less than 2 months,1.0,"I bought this headset on 3rd August 2021 and it worked for a month. Then now it stopped working and it doesn‚Äôt get charged. There was no physical damage.I tried for warranty but couldn‚Äôt get through any options. If anyone knows options to get warrants claimed, plz do let me know."
Noise cancellation op,4.0,"This is just amazing if i talk about noise cancellation. I used it when people were nagging around and i didn't feel anything accept silence. Sound is amazing, bass is good. Overall 4 star. I'd give 5 star of baas was damn crazy"
Decent build quality and sound,3.0,"The product has decent build quality which makes it durable. However the cable is too long which makes it look a little weird hanging around your ears. Battery drains quickly. Sound is amazing, perhaps the USP of the product. Not good for bike riders as wearing a helmet gives pain in the ears."
Bad product,1.0,"First of all, there are alot of connectivity issues. Battery backup is reliable but the sound is a bit crackling on high notes. The bluetooth connection seems to be wobbling on putting my phone in my jeans pocket. Worst product at 1.6k"
"Amazing Didn't even yet got my earphones back, it's been 15 days, sad for buying it",2.0,"I really didn't like it anyway, it causes the pain forbears by its bad earbuds ,bcoz size is not good,And even bluetooth isn't working good, many times it gives gaps ,no perfect connection, so I returned it, but bad customer care didn't get my request yet, it's been 15 days almost. üíî"
Fake product,1.0,I got a fake product. It isn't working at all. I visited to the service center and I got to know that this is a duplicate product and not original headphone. They provided service denial letter to send to Amazon service center. I will not suggest to buy from this buyer.
"Worst packaging, average sound quality but good noise cancellation @999",2.0,"cons:1. packaging wasn't good.2. average sound bass.3. Not good for old songs( you will get 'chan chan' sound)Pros:Stylish, Strong, nice noise cancellation, good battery life, Calling mic.Boatz brandI will give 3/5 Rating.You can expect more @999/-"
Good,4.0,"Charging lasted very long. Also good bass and noise cancelation.  At times whatsapp call voice is getting low , other than that this is the  best at all."
Good sound quality,4.0,"Received in a unsatisfying packaging which seemed like a duplicate product. Still not sure about it's originality. However, sound quality is good and battery backup is also pretty good.Quality wise it is fine considering the period I have used it. Can't comment upon the durability etc as of now."
Not bad,4.0,Battery backup is very bad. After 5 month use it will run only 1.0 hrs to 1.30 hrs but promising 10 hrs. Most defective product I feel.
"Excellent product, no lag must buy",5.0,It's been a month now I am using this earphone. Since day one I am getting almost 10hours of playtime in full charge and there is no lagging in sound too. The bass is good enough. There is no connection loss at all.. worth a buy
Not worth the description and money.,2.0,"Very disappointed. The battery hardly stays for an hour, noise cancelation next to no, bass effect is barely there, it says It is sweat resistant but the ear buds slip off with a liitle sweat also, overall not happy with what the product promised vs delivered."
Replacement guaranteed,5.0,Excellent service I purchased them in January 2019 and in June 2019 both headphones stopped working...I contacted the boat service center and as it was in1 year replacement warranty...to my surprise after a procedure within 10 days I got new pair of headphones replaced delivered to my door step... awesome service
Good oneüëç,4.0,"Good product, I baught it for my dad but personally used it for 3-4 days excessively and caught no issues in sound quality, call connectivity, range or anything else, a good headphones."
PROBLEM WITH THIS BLUETOOTH BOAT HEADPHONE,5.0,"The only problem with this headphone is that, on switching different apps on mobile, it is not able to auto-configure fastly.Sometimes, sound comes via the speaker on switching app suddenly (for eg:  from Spotify to youtube). It takes time to configure the audio via Bluetooth on switching apps on the mobile"
Charging port Damaged,1.0,"Bought it on 26 Nov, 19 performance was good except battery backup, at 80% charge it used to switch off but still manged with it, now i have got issue with charging port, it got broken and for warranty claim, service center contact number is not working /switched off, Email ID provided in details of product is not working, so helpless now with this issue."
Decent product,4.0,"The sound is decent and battery life is excellent. Bass is amazing. Only problem comes with comfort. It starts hurting ears after sometime. And the ear support is kinda loose, so it gets easily lost. But, all over ... preet good product"
"Not very good, but yeah for this price range these are apt",4.0,It's a good earphone if your range is around 1.5k . Battery is not very good but fine. Sound is also fine.If you can increase your budget a little then go for Tagg Inferno..they are the best earphones available in the market under 2.5k.
Good product,4.0,boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
Its a 0 star product,1.0,It does not reduces surrounding noise.i bought 3 sets and all get defects with in a year. The quality is very low in this price. Bought for 999. Amazon should keep a eye on customer reviews whether the seller is selling right or cheating.
Waste of money,1.0,"Waste of money, it doesn't fit in my ear, battery doesn't last half an hour also,.. very low quality products ...I never uses at all now it's complete waste"
Bad Experience,1.0,"I had been using this device around 3 months..it was nice in first experience..but slowly it started disconnecting automatically..so I applied for a replacement.. they replaced me the better one in look only...My problem is it is disconnecting frequently automatically..Bluetooth is a major problem I think...So, My request is to buy any wired earphone than wireless....because, it is costly but has no performance quality..."
Battery indicator level,3.0,It is a problem with battery indicator.Battery indicator on mobile shows 100% or 80% only. Even if the battery is 50% or even less it still reflects 80% and so on. So it does not reflect the exact batterylevel. After 3months of use both the side earphones not working. First one side goes down and then second day other side
Battery backup was awesome,5.0,The battery backup was awesome its give 30 to 40 hour continue playbackBase was also goodCalling Noise cancellation was decentWhen you wear this headphone and playing music you literally don't hear surrounding soundsIt also give high volume and high bass
Dont buy it and also not from amazon. They dont fulfill promises they make..,1.0,"Very bad experience. I bought it from amazon. I got box opened and in torn & damged position. Headphone was also in bad condition like second hand and it was not working. Not in a working condition. It was not like shown in image. Waste of money, pay hard earned money also and be back of them for the same. Very bad, dont go for it."
Colour issue.,4.0,"The product is really good,But the product has started loosing its colour shade.Its just  been a month and my colour is completely vanished.YOU HAVE TO WORK ON THE COLOUR BOAT!"
VERY VERY POOR SERVICES üòûüòî,4.0,"Quality is good but u should not expect good service from boat.  Worst services, Within warrenty I requested for repairs or replacement, picked up very early by courier but from last 3 months no reply, worst"
Great for the bass lovers!,4.0,Only recommended for people who like the base a little too loud and enjoy the pop and rock as the sound in this category plays a dominant role and not the audio. You can‚Äôt really enjoy soft music on this.
Good sound quality with poor noise cancellation,5.0,"Got for 999.. value for money product, after using 2 monthsüëçBut 1 year passed and as my friend said usually this earphone are not working after 1yr. Many of my friend faced same problem. First it's one side was not working and now whole. Also the noise cancellation is not good.and worst thing is that they are useless after 1yr. No use of warranty."
"Value for money, but battery lasts only 4hrs",3.0,"Battery backup is poor. Full charge dosent even last for 6hrs. Rest everything is excellent (sound, volume control etc)"
Not value for money,1.0,"Not value for money, sound quality not upto the mark, even 100 ruppes earphone do better than this sound quality. Battery life is not that good, and startup and battery low instruction sound are irritating. Next person not able to head you because microphone is cheap quality"
A fairly decent product for the price!,3.0,The build quality is not the best you can find.Audio is quite good but I often face audio stuttering issues. The mic is bad.Summary:Audio quality : 3/5Mic : 2/5Bluetooth connectivity : 2/5Noise cancelation : 3/5The problem I am facing might be limited to this particular piece . I have requested for a return.
Needs improvement in switches,3.0,The rubber padding on noise control buttons gave Way pretty quickly. Didn't expect this from BOAT.
Good,4.0,This product is awesome but it little bit noise cancellation.Battery backup is durable I charged it one time and use approx 3-4 days easily.Build design of this neck band is look like very heavy and ear buds are little much big which cause ear pain .Thank you
Quality par excellence.,5.0,Its an awesome product. Hats off to boat for set the bar high for its products. The bass is punchy. The vocals are really good and the background music of the other instruments is heard properly in this device. Does not lag is any sort of game be it Pubg or COD. The connectivity is fast. Thanx to amazon.
worst experience,1.0,"I bought this neckband from Amazon.No issue in delivery .it was all good. But the product is not up to mark. At first, its eartips fell off, and then in few months connectib=vity problem. Today it has stopped working .battery is 100%. I don't know what to do. It was my mistake to buy this."
The product is great ü§ç,4.0,"It has a great quality of sound and bass. This product is best for music lovers and not recommended to persons whose preference is audio designing.I have bought this for 799Rs, for this price it is insaneüñ§."
Really great earphones at such price,5.0,"I got it for 1000 which is great getting this earphones at this price is really great .sound quality is also good , base is really good here , the quality of sound is also goodbattery life: it last long for like 5-6 days for 1-2 hours per day usage ."
right ear piece stopped working after 6 months,2.0,"when i first received the buttons were very very hard, even if i press also it was not taking, and then had to return it and got an exchange, and now after 6 months, the right part stopped working suddenly"
Don't Buy this Product,1.0,I bought this product on Mar since 2 months Earphone has in Death Condition.  I tried almost one month day by day to Customer Service to Replace the Product or Claim the warranty but No use... One of the Worst Experiences in my life
Good Product,5.0,An outstanding product.The sound quality is outstanding and the connection procedure with mobile device is too simple.
Good but not very good!!,3.0,Overall Good!One earplug stopped working after 5 months.Voice sometimes not clearly audible to the person on other side on phone call!
Battery life,4.0,Sound quality is just awesome at thi price range...Noise cancellation is not too good but it cancel maximum noise...One demrit is that the battery life u can't rely on the battery indicator its shows that ur battery is 80% and in next half an hour it sudden fall at 20% or 30% nd after 5 minute it will switch off....Overall at this price range it is awesome earphone...u can buy without any kind of doubt in ur mind..üôèüôè
Don't buy for calling,1.0,I suggest don't buy if you are looking for calling purpose as there is no noise cancellation in that the other side will not able to listen if some one speak loudly at back or if you are on road. Rest for listening music it's good .
Good mixture of bass with clear crisp sound,5.0,"I have tried few other wireless earphones but beats coming from this one is great. It gives a good balanced sound and it is so comfortable that it can be used for long duration. Battery life is also good, battery is easily giving 5 6 hrs of backup. I only found one thing that can be better that it takes a while to charge the battery completely, 1.5/2 hrs for charging.I have Boats wireless speaker also and that piece is also nice.Go for it."
Defective product when delivered,1.0,"I saw such review for the same product by one reviewer.....who complained that their ear piece was broken when delivered. Still I ignored and put based the same product...after opening the packet, when I configured Bluetooth with my phone, I found that in one ear, there was no sound...interestingly, I find that one wire is already broken....I don't understand that what is the meaning of that seal of the packet which guarantees the authenticity of the headphone"
Terrific purchase,5.0,Sound quality -5/5Bass-5/5Connectivity-5/5(depends on your device)Noise cancelling-4/5Silicon clip and build quality 4/5Can be used for fast running and gym.Battery backup-5.5 hours at 100% volume but believe me 85% volume is more than enough. Overall best at 999. Atleast better than realms buds.
Good but buds slipping outside,3.0,"Good but buds slipping outside , except buds everything is fine . After some days xhargjng indicator will be damaged. Recommended to buy at this price ."
Satisfies one's need at an affordable price..!!,4.0,It's damn good.....i must agree that this is one of the best Bluetooth headsets in the market today..!Decent BassDecent Sound qualityDecent looksAnd Decent Battery lifeBut little bit expensive for such Decent PerformanceBut if u manage to get it for ‚Çπ999 in any sale thenSimple replace all Decent with Awesome in above lines......üòÖüòÖ
Highly not recommended,1.0,Worst quality have been using for 9 months and it is the 4th times one of the side stopped working and very costly . Not recommended .very costly as compared to the quality
After a week of use,5.0,"Good product, awesome battery,best bass, colour of headphones are slightly dark than what is showing in pictures.Box is slightly old and has some scratches but the inner product is cool. Go for it."
Superb experience üôåüí¥,5.0,Sound quality is superb i never found such sound quality before in any ear phones. It properly cancels out the noise as I cannot hear Any sound disturbance and due to this feature i enjoy my dance sessions with listening music with these boat rockerz üôåüëåüèª‚ú® And with no doubt Bass quality is superb. üëåüèª
Best in range.,5.0,Pros:-1. Easy to carry on neck feel really comfortable.2. Connectivity is simple.3. Bass and sound clarity is awesome.4. Backup was also overwhelming.5. Bluilt quality is also good.Cons:-1. Connectivity range is little low.
A worthwhile purchase,4.0,The sound quality is good not too tinny. However it is not very good for running as it slaps against the neck. The magnetic earpods are nice so they don't fly around.
Just ok.,2.0,"Once paired it difficult to pair to other devices.And during call the other end gets a lot of noise.It's an ok earphone.It's useful for rough use while travelling in trains ,which are so spacious, in India.I switched to a wired earphone for work use. Sony mdt xb 55. It had defect when delivered. And it was later replaced."
Bad... One side is not working,1.0,I am writing this after 7 month approximately ( bought on may 7 2019 and writing reviews on 1st December 2019).... And Sad to tell that  one side is not working... This is really bad... Though the headset are good  ... These are only for 6 months... Only buy this product if you are ok for 6 months... Not recommended for long term purpose... Please do not buy if you use it extremely...
Warranty,1.0,One ear set not working and product within warranty pls arrange to replace
Awful experience,1.0,Initially it's very good bt stop working very early in 3 months only. And also I am. Not able to register my product to boat when I bought it
highly recommended for music,5.0,excellent bass sound and notice cancellationboat products are bestthe bluetooth range is 10mchrge too fast in less than 30. min and give 10 hr backupshould go for it
Not great,4.0,"Battery life is fine. Sound quality isn't great. Better go for expensive ones or pro-plus.Also this comes with a micro usb (B type), better go for a product that comes with a C type charger, so that you don't need to carry an extra cable with you."
"Best one to use, too handy and nice quality!",5.0,"I purchased boAt Rockerz 255 and boAt Rockerz 261 Sports Wireless Earphones in offer.I found this 255 more useful and handy in comparison.Sound quality wise, 261 is better but still its not way too much better than 255.I really hesitate use 261 as it's heavier and larger rubber part and the rest.Overall, I would suggest you to buy boAt 255 if you need talk often on phone calls or even want to listen to music."
Decent headphones at 899,4.0,"Sound not good i have been using cx180 and bassheads 225 recently u cant compare them with this,still noise cancellation is cool,(do not wear while travelling).Battery gives 10+ hrs continue usage,For me the earbuds hurt a bit after using of long hours.Overall still a good deal."
Above average headset (poor battery),3.0,"In terms of sound quality, it is neither great nor bad. But what is really disappointing is how quickly the battery discharges. I use it primarily for office calls and it barely lasts for 3 to 4 hours."
Quality not worth it,2.0,Quality is not upto the mark. Instead you can just go with JBL wireless. It is just 300 rupees more than boat or you can opt for JBL wired which is just 800 bucks and way more worth than boat. Too much noise in the background. It even got replaced once but no use. Now they have only replace option and no refunds. Waste product. Don't even like it. It's just fallen in my drawer everyday and I don't feel like using it at all.  DO NOT EVER BUY BOAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR QUALITY.
Best bluetooth earphones üéß,5.0,Boat rockerz 255 pro is incredibly amazing and I think everyone should go for this...sound quality and bass is soo good and it gets charged only in 20 minutes and perfect for daily use.... it's actually better than headphones and mic is the best overall the product is amazing
Must buy wireless headset,4.0,sound and bass quality is good and received as shown in picture.It was great deal at this price.
Color mismatch.,2.0,"The colour shown in the image while purchasing is totally different from the one we have received, I have a doubt now if the product is original or fake.You can clearly see the difference within the photos which is displayed while purchasing and the one which is received."
Received fake used boat product with ear wax in it ü§¢ü§Æü§Æ,1.0,"I ordered boat 255 pro in 1099 rs in offer but, I Received fake third class used boat product in that earphone speaker has some ear dirty waxü§Æü§Æü§¢ omg worest experienced from amaozn no accessories in that box only that fake product 0 rating to the gross product ü§¢ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ"
Over all nice,4.0,"Nice product. Sound quality good, battery back up good, key functional easy, connectivity with mobile process also easy. All functionality are user friendly.But I think, only two things need to little bit improve, which are sound quality and battery backup.On 1st day after full charged, battery backup given approx10hrs."
Best budget wireless earphones,4.0,Bought Boats Rockerz 255 recently and its upto mark. Works flawlessly with my OnePlus 3T. Sound quality is surprisingly good with good amount of bass and treble. Also battery backup is good.Highly recommended!
Malfunction within no time,2.0,"Though the sound quality of earphones is really good initially. One of the buds stopped functioning after 12 days depriving me of even a replacement. Though my key strokes could be heard, music couldnt be played in one of the earplugs. They are very handy and comfortable in design too. But a reapir within no time is disappointing."
Nice product üëç,4.0,1) Overall quality of product is good2) Sound quality is excellent3) Playback time is not enough satisfactory as given by comapany product features4) Connectivity is good5) It takes 1 hr to fully charged so its good6) Worth to buy in such moderate price
Pain In The Ears,2.0,Does what its made for but causes pain in the ears if used for little longer than even half an hour. I tried changing the plugs on ears but that does not solve the issue since the inner part of earpiece is super hard
Very poor Quality,1.0,It is a like a product been purchased from palika bazar. Works inside the bazar and stops once we are out from there.The device was working properly till yesterday. Yesterday ie 12.10.2019 was the last date to return the device in case of any issues.Device has properly maintained its class till the return date and lost its breadth once return dates ended.. Great job üëç
Very good product.,5.0,Excellent sound and bass quality. Noise cancellation is good at higher volume. Happy with the product. Definitely recommended if you are into jogging/cycling.
It's for u but not for me üòÇ,4.0,I like this product but one thing is irritating is there ear plugs bcoz they give extra design which is not too big to plug in ear others wise this is good if u r comfortable u can buy it but i m not so i return.
Good Product Good Service Good Battery Life,4.0,Product is Too GoodAnd Service Center Of Product Cell Care Center In Pimpri Pune Maharashtra is also goodI got Hassel free replacement of product while I was face problem related mic in my product
Average product,4.0,"Average sound quality, You can't hear details because they have more bass so you miss the details, battery backup is very less approx 6 hours at 60% volume which is not good at this price."
Headset issue,3.0,Within six months one side of headset didn't work. Never expected this.
Just worth its price.,4.0,"Creates problem if you are talk & put your phone in pant pockets. Other than that, sound quality is great for it's cost. Battery life is decent, but withers down though with time."
Unable to plug into YouTube videos.,1.0,"Sry, dnt buy this item guys. This product is incompatible with youtube videos. That means basically this is useless."
A ok product.. suggested for daily use,3.0,Well it‚Äôs good product for this price.Sound clarity is good.. but not that great when compared to few others.Battery back up : I was able to use it continuesly for 5 to 6 hrs.You have products with even more battery back up..but for the price.. it‚Äôs worth for daily use.
"Boat ear phone ko replce kr dijiye , guarantee period me h",4.0,"22 oct 2020 ko maine boat earphones mangwaya 5 month to shi se chala lekin april 2021 me ek ear phone me awaj aa rhi h dusre me nhi aa rhi ,avi warranty period me v h plz amazone ise replace kar dijiye ."
Must buy,5.0,I have bought 3 for my family...still working fine after using for more than 6 months to 1 yr....must buy product....but do warranty thing online on their website which I forgot...
Waste product üëéfrom seller (Appario Retail Private Ltd),1.0,"Waste product, Its always says battery low.. website says 6 hours playback time but hardly it plays one hour.. , i haven't seen full 2 hours movie even charging after charging 100% ... I don't recommend to buy this product particularly from seller(Appario Retail Private Ltd)"
Design needs to be improved,1.0,"Not comfortable on ear, ear feels pain, not a good design, they should learn from Mi Basic design which is very comfortable in ear"
Good Product That Could Be Better,5.0,Nose cancellation is not really upto the mark. Bluetooth connectivity is pretty ok. The sound however is simply fab!  You'll surely love it if you're a bass lover!Overall it's a good product though.
The Bass is incredible.,4.0,"The product was amazing, The Bass and Sound were Stunning. But recently I was facing a issue a couple of times, After we're done with connecting the Bluetooth, It automatically disconnects. and we should restart again to reconnect to the device.  Other than this so far, The product is Amazing."
At this price point these are the best earphones.,4.0,"It's been over 1 year using these earphones, still its sound quality is good. Noise cancellation work nice too.Things you have to consider; very high bass, decent quality as per the price, excellent After sell service. (I had an issue with battery; they solved it quickly with ease)Things you don't forget to consider; No Treble; low battery backup."
It's nothing spectacular,4.0,The earphones are average but that is to be expected from it's price. The earpiece could have been better and the battery is pretty solid. The sound quality sometimes is just horrible (like stereo). The bass is appreciably good as well.7/10
All good.. But not the battery backup,5.0,"Changing my feedback post usage of 10 months in which 3 months ar lockdown...precisely its rarely used , mow the bluetooth is not able to connect with any device.Now what to do ??"
Bass is good but can be improved in connection,3.0,I am reviewing this after 7 days of using thisI think this is little bit laterVoice came 7-8 sec later the vedio on mx player and YouTube as well
Worst sound quality,1.0,Boat 255 varient was good however this 255 pro plus is degraded in terms of treble and bass quality. Not recommended. Oppo enco series is a way better option.
Very useful and quality based good and worthable price.,5.0,"I always love boat earphones.. Especially this model is most of my family members using. That's why I always preferred to buy this one. And, Thanks for this price drop It was very comforting for buy easily. Thanks u for quick delivery also..Loely..."
Nice product but gets damaged,4.0,"For the first 6-7 months it performed wonderfully. But one side stopped working just before completing one year, so luckily I could replace the item via warranty card. But one side of the new one also has stopped working one month ago. Gotta buy another earphone."
Good product ..guys just go for it,5.0,I like it ...without second thought u can purchase ..hurray to indian maker who made it .‚úîÔ∏è‚õèÔ∏èüá±üá∫
Best but could be more better,3.0,"Liked the product but sound could be more better. Design is good as compared to other device. The only prblem I found with this product is the rubber ear fittings, chances are more that u can lost it as it automatically gets loosen. Company should give extra pair of fitting same as ear buds."
The worst body quality and after service!!!!,2.0,The quality of sound was good but the quality of the built was poor . The charging port has-been moved away and it was found rusted ..I bought it on July and it's still under warranty.But the Boat costumer care people din't even picking the phone .I complained in their web site.But no acknowledgement from their side...What should I do??
Unable to claim the warranty. Worst customer service and product too,1.0,My Head phone of left side is not working. I am able to listen from right head set. There is no proper contact number of Boat to get the replacement. This product has one year warranty.@ Amazon. You should never sell the product when there is no response from the vendor for the replacement. I have emailed but no response. I will go to consumer complaint soon and I file a case
Worst customer service of boat.,2.0,"Quality is good, but if you will face any issue in earphones then no one will respond from Amazon or Boat, your 100 mails will go in vein. I have written many times to the boat customer service but they never replied to any mail and their contact no. Never works."
Nice product,5.0,Before buy this I was really concerned because on youtube people said that the material isn't good and wires r thin but now after using it for a while I can say it's really good no problem with the material and headphones won't look good if wires were anymore thicker great sound quality as always and decent connectivity üîã life is about 5 to 6 hours
Donot buy,1.0,I ordered them on 18th may. Its been just a month and one side stopped working itself. Such bad quality earphone. I font have to box also now to send it back. Useless.
USELESS EARPHONES,1.0,"AMAZON IS USELESS, KNOW I PURCHASE FROM FLIPKART, THEY ARE MORE BETTER IN THIS REGARD,  THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WORKING I NEED A REPLACEMENT, I PURCHASED THIS ITEM AND IT WORKED FOR ONLY TWO DAYS, I SENT FOR WARRANTY AND THEY REPLACED ME WITH OTHER USED EARPHONE , BUT AGAIN THE EARPHONE IS NOT CHARGING ,REALLY USELESS PRODUCT, A"
Value for money üí∞,5.0,Just wow but since sound quality is ok ok type . I think realmi budds have the better sound system but wait!ü§îjust wait for a second I forget to tell you something . Oh I got it ü§£ it's bass quality ... Wow just fab dude . I must have to say that others head set can't give you this type of bass quality. So u have to try it üéß
Unboxing,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†The battary backup time is ossm . And I'll like the design and build quality , but the teal green colour is not that exact as shown  by the seller, it is more on green side .sound is good and punchy , bass is the best in class ,noise cancellation is okkk."
Best battery backupüòç,5.0,"I'm using this earphones from last 5 days, I have not charged them till now......Ofcourse I'm not using them continuously.....but I'm using it regularly while jogging & exercise......still it's going so well.........And sound quality is also good as well........I'm very happy with this product.......must buy.....ü•≥ü§©"
Not Durable. Lasts only till warantty period,2.0,"Not a durable product. Even after very less usage the product lasted only for 1 year. Initially one side stopped working and after a few days the other one too went dead. After spending extra bucks for a comparitively premium product , it should have definitely lasted longer. Since it is not repairable, the product and the money goes in the bin."
Sturdy and durable.,4.0,"Pretty sturdy for the price. But the funny part is almost 12 people at my work place have the same product and hence we all can't leave it anywhere even for a second  .. Because it will be lost or exchanged üòÅ which also tells us about the economy and quality, that the product provides.The power button is a bit slow. Rest all seems pretty fine. It's the best thing at this price. It's very handy and durable at the same time."
Boat Rocks!,5.0,"An absolute winner given the price bracket.I'm also in love with Boat as a company. I ran into a problem with audio in one of the ears during the warranty period and raised a compain on their website. The product was picked, repaired and sent back to me all within 15 days.  And no questions were asked."
Boat company,5.0,This is a super boat headphones everyone can use this. I really appreciate boat Brand and also Amazon ro this super headphones. It is wireless also . Everyone Can buy  this . The colour is alsoAwesome. Once again I am thanking boat headphones . We can connect with rockerz 255 pro.

Stops working when kept at certain angles.,1.0,"Worst product that i have ever come across, suddenly stops playing while driving bike or during workout at gym when the position changes, its the worst feeling ever.Quality wise the product is ok, but because of the problem it gets annoying. it happened from the day 1 , and after less then 2 months it escalated still. i am going for a new one now."
Great Product!,5.0,I have been using Boat earphones for quite sometime now and they are really great. The battery backup is great too. I initially received defective ones but on replacement they were fine. But the service was really quick. Really happy with the product.

Bluetooth gets disconnected very often,1.0,Plugged in. The BT gets disconnected and get reconnected again. The quality of connection to any device is poor. This is the first time I am seeing this issue in any BT related device. Unable to replace/return due to outer packaging missing
It's avg overall,2.0,Connectivity is not very smooth also two devices cannot be connected at one'sAs battery life is very good but as it drains one side earphone volumes decrease and feels improper to useCall quality is good noise cancellation works
Charging Slot issue,1.0,"Not a good product, the charging slot of the earphone will damage eventually with time. my earphone's charging slot is intact but the device doesn't charge. it's useless if I cannot charge the Bluetooth earphone. if you can pay a bit more, you should choose c type charging slot instead."

Now they are not even getting charged... They are just dead. Pathetic quality. Complete wastage of money. Want refund or replacement whatever is possible."
Pathetic customer service by boat and Amazon for this product,1.0,"Changing the rating to 1 star, it ran ok until it died. Company seems to be shur, not respnding on emails for warranty claim as battery died before 1 year. Amazon seems to be of no help in this and keep on screwing the customer with nothing but ' thankyou for ur patience and understanding' line in the script. Amazon seems to be passing time and not helping at all.. dont buy these or you will be screwed too .."
Worst product,1.0,"Worst product, Don't buy it any one, i have faced so many problems from this product,I never see this type of worst product, No sound quality, No Noice cancellation,Waste of money"
Worth ur money,4.0,Sound quality is great. So is noise cancellation. Its comfortable. The fit in the ears is good too. Doesn't come off while running or speed walking. Would recommend.
worst experience of warranty with this product.,1.0,"I sent the product to Boat Service center Mumbai for a warranty replacement, they took completely 2 months for sending the replacement unit from 30 august 2019 to 31 october , when i opened the replacement unit package , WTF it was a used unit dirty , fully destroyed unit , unable to pair with my phone . Only takes charge .... BOAt cheated me in a drastic way , and my 1499 rupees are gone to hell........"
Go for it,5.0,Its a good product. You can go for it .battery life is good and noise cancellation is to the point . i had problem with the packaging though.
Worth it,5.0,Worth it.The earphones are comfortable to use.Noise cancelling effect is good.Sound quality is excellent.Battery will last the entire day.Using it for more than a year now.No issues.
Check the reviews before you buy any product,1.0,First of all the product quality was very low and secondly the colour which I have ordered was not the colour and they gave me blue colour..Can't write the review that time because I was out of the city but one of the worst products.. Never expected that reputed and a brand like Amazon will have this kind of service..
Awesome Battery backup and decent sound quality...,5.0,"The best part of battery backup...I am using it since I received and after  using 2 days for about 8-10 hrs, it's battery is 80% now....Sound quality is decent."
"Thank you for this Extraordinary product, wonderful experience by using boat rockerz",5.0,"As always all products of BOAT is amazing, in this boat rockerz all functions working in best condition, super sound quality with bass, also 100% charging complete within 1.5 hours and more then 6 hours of running time, so I'm strongly recommend this product.Also quickly delivered this product."
Extremely good BT earphones!! Loud and Super BASS.,5.0,The sound quality is good. I mean it can‚Äôt be compared with Senheiser or Bose but its worth the price.Perfect to use while running; the earbuds are so comfortable that you wouldn‚Äôt even feel they are plugged in.
Product is not working,4.0,I have this product on 8th august 2019. It was an excellent product.  But now it is not working. There is one year warranty on the product. But as I am trying to contact the amazon it is saying that due to covid only essential services are available. I want to return the product as it is still in warranty period.
As always MIC is the Issue,3.0,"Product is overall good, with only one issue that I have observed in the boat product, that mic is not that strong. You have to keep juggling your mic, so that other person can hear you. The mic captures more noise from outside and I guess it doesn't do noise cancellation properly at all. I do not have a choice to return it after 2 months of use."
Never buy this product. I did the replacement and still worst like hell.,2.0,"Worst and Defect product...i received on dec 8, 2021... And i did my replacement that day itself because the left side is not working at all...And again the replaced product also flop ...i got complain from my friend whenever i used this and now the replacement period is over."
Worst battery,1.0,Over all the product is nice but battery backup is horrible it hardly last for 3 hours while playing game... I bought this to play pubg but unfortunately i am not able to enjoy it... I wish to return it.Dont buy ds as after 6 months of ussage the sound quality and volume lowers. Sound cancellation dsnt work at all
good but disconnects in between,4.0,"it is good headset but in between disconnects from phone eventhough it is nearby and then connects after a while, it is quite annoying when it repeatedly happens without a reason"
Good Headphones worth buying.,4.0,I have used it for 1 day and no complaints till now. Build quality is good. Very light weight. Sound quality is good. It has super extra bass so those who don't like extra bass have to think on it before buying. Battery life is also good 5hour 35 minutes. Saw 2 movies in a day along with attending calls. Charging time is approx 2 hours. One of the good features I like that when you connect to android phone it shows headphone's battery icon next to bluetooth icon. That battery icon show how much charge is left.
Not Bad,4.0,It was good product if we want to connect another device we need to unpair the blutooth and we could connect it was not a good as rockerz 255 pro
Connection is very easy amd sound is good.,4.0,Sound quality is good and you connect two devices at one time one is for media and one is for calling options.. Wish you wellth...

Battery life is too good.,3.0,Bass and sound quality is medium.Colour is good.Battery life is high.Built quality is painful and lower.Not good for gym and racing.You cannot use it continuously 3 to 4 hour.Noise cancellation feature is like ghost which exist or not no one can say.

Okay. Not for outside talks,3.0,"At home, you will receive the best sound. Real issue starts when its taken outside, other persons voice cracks in between as if the Bluetooth signal from my mobile in front pocket breaks. I do not increase volume level above 80 as its banging my head"
Great product..true value for money,4.0,"Sound quality is really good and initially, battery backup counts for 5-6 hrs.. fits well in ear but noice cancellation is just ok ok type..overall it's a must buy purchase at BBD price of 899/-"
Wast of money,1.0,Pros:1.Warranty services are worst.2. Mic problem is very often. While calling other person will b unable to here you. Rubbish BTEF for calling.3. Bluetooth range is just one meter. I measured it.4. Low charge every time.Pros: good bass.

Cheap sound quality,1.0,"Firstly, none of the buds fitted me, second, the audio quality is sooo soo bad, there is no bass at all, genuinely the worth felt for not more than Rs. 100. Don't know if it was a copy or original, but thanks to amazon customer service, i was able to return it instead of being replaced"
Worth review,5.0,Standard issue with any kind of bluetooth device hanging around neck.It must be resolved around all such bluetooth headset.Apart from that sound quality is 6 on 5 it's perfectly best.Connectivity is good.Only issue is strap it has lost it shape due to regular usage
NOT recommended,1.0,"Used for 4 month's.. just calling purpose..When it connect, it says ""you are now connected to rockers 255 pro"" and it keep disconnecting n reconnecting.. everytime it says this sentence :(Also if u keep it very near then audio shakes .. I am using my old with wire ear phones that's better üòÖ"
No AptX but still great.,4.0,I use OnePlus 7 pro . Earphones doesn't support AptX but even without AptX they are quite good. Alot of bass and not  very sharp lyrics. I've used it only till 60-65% volume and thats enough i feel. Overall its a nice product but false branding of AptX support.

Neckband length is a problem,2.0,Voice while talking over phone gets clipped and sometimes I need to reconnect to get the sound. It's only around a month and I have started getting a smell of a bad buy. The neckband is so large that the earbuds come out due to the heaviness of the band. I don't know if the designers had a big heart planning for the length.

aver all you should buy this at this rate,5.0,"very nice product I am reviewing this product after using it for 2 or 3 months , sound quality is good battery life is of stander level including fast charging, built quality is also good , very light weight , flexible too.

Not Worth It,2.0,Sound quality is poor. bass feels completely absent. too much noise in music. treble is terrible. Bluetooth glitches during transit. Batttery life is great. overall not good product. you can use it for calling or watching movies but terrible choice for music. Don't buy this if you listen music all the time. Speakers are poor quality will give you headache after 10 15 minutes.
Can be Compared to Bose,5.0,"I sometimes think that, has Boat made it accidentally or what. :D How come such deep bass in this price tag. I have Bose Free Soundsport, I sometimes feel that this one has deeper bass than Bose. But yes ofcourse Bose is Bose, in terms of sound clarity. 20times higher price. But still these two are comparable. Good work Boat."

Not happy at all,2.0,Does not feel comfortable on the ears at all. They keep falling out.  Return facility is also not available.  Sound quality is not that good either.
Good one,4.0,Sound quality is much good than expected. But the neck band is flexible and ear buds are little bit heavy that's why it falls down again and again from ears. And neckband don't have vibrator.
Not comfortable to Ears,3.0,Bass and all is good.. sound ok not exceptional but lets talk about the comfort.. its not comfortable to ears it feels soo hard and heavy moreover you need to charge it. You need to charge it for an hour.Battery doesnt stay more than 9 hours.I would say there are better options for the same amount.

boAt  earphones,4.0,Good  quality  product  . The  additional ear pieces of different  sizes is good.  I would  have  liked  the  neck piece  to  be  little  more stiff.  I use it  while  walking/jogging  .

Not up to the mark,3.0,"sound, bass and noise cancellation are good.But connectivity to multiple Bluetooth devices feature is not well implemented seems.

Waste of money,1.0,Everything was going well for 7-8 months after that right side is stopped working. It found this problem very common. My friends are also struggling with the same problem. I won't recommend this for long time. I found waste of my money.

Awesome earphonen with awesome after sale service!,5.0,My boat rockerz stopped working after about 11 months. I registered a complaint and the company arranged a pickup of the non-working earphones and replaced it without any charges. I have not experienced such great service ever in India. Absolutely great experience! Love my boat rockerz!
Worst product,1.0,"I am sharing review after two months of usage.. the earphone has torally stopped working.. it's not even blinking light for switch on mode, and it's of no use now.Very bad from such company.."
Worth for the Price,4.0,"Merits:-1. Been using it for last 5 month. The earphone's sound and the bass is mindblowing.2. Once if u fix the earphone into the ear you can't hear anything from outside even without playing songs.3. About the charging, they have mentioned 6hrs standby but it will be upto 7 to 9 hrs also if you are  using it continually.4. Sweat proof is also awesome,  Very flexible,  weightless. Demerit:-1. Ear buds are not perfectly fit but u can enjoy enjoy the music."
WORST SERVICE BY BOAT,1.0,"Bought it a year ago, used for 5 months and one side stopped working raised a complaint to boat team didn't get any response, but received a torn empty box as so called ""replacement unit""The service is worst and dont expect any response or help from boat companyBuy at your own risk dont expect it to be fixed if it stops working."
Very bad quality,2.0,I think it's a duplicate material of boat. B'coz I've alrdy used another boat wireless earphone. It's mouth speaker quality isn't good and functions are too slow. Sometimes it's not working properly.
Awesome,5.0,"I can say 1 thing , just blindly buy this product. I buyed during the offers and I got this at very less price 999. The bass n sound is simply awesome. Don't waste more money on other headsets .it's the very best headset and you will love it ."
Like this product,4.0,"Boat rockerz 255 pro is really amazing headphones, battery life is so good, it's fully charge in only 30 minutes and you can use more than 8-9 hrs with non-stop music, calls etc. Amazon packing is not that good, i disappointed with the packing course there no safety guard around headphones."
My review,4.0,"Sound quality and Bass is good ..but i will rate it 8/10 in battery because battery drains out too quickly ,its like100% to 80%- in 1¬Ω hours80%to 60%-in 1 hour60%to 40% -in 30 min40% to 20% -in 15min20% to zero- in 2minBluetooth connectivity- Quite good 8/10Looks-9/10Call quality-7/10 Not too clearBass-10/10Comfort-9/10Overall-8/10"
Not worthy ...,1.0,"The product is not worth buying as per the price. Their are many other brand products available in the market with better sound quality and and that with a lesser price. The sound quality is also not good. Theirs a defect for the Bluetooth range. The only pro that I found was the battery life, which lasts approx 5-6 hours after full charge on continuous play."
My Order and Received Item is not matching,2.0,"My Order was not for Neckbank in Ear Headphone. But what I Received was NeckBand Headset.Picture shown in Image is different and what they deliver is different.Even this Neck band is also not flexible it's just like you are having U-Shaped sturdy pipe is on your Neck.Mike is not near your mouth as it's attached to neckband, so you can't use these headphones for communication."
Best neckband under 1500,5.0,"The earphines provided with the neckband are less comfortable,sometimes it pains but provides mind-blowing grip.I surely suggest it for running as well as gymming purpose.The music and bass quality is excellent.Battery backup is best in  ‚Çπ2000 price range.An excellent product from a trusted brand.Just go for it."
Worst product completely,1.0,Noice cancellation is not there. On call only background sound is hearing and not the persons voice. So much of distortion in voice to the opponent on call. And treble is more than base. Treble and base balance is not there. I brought it with full expectations to gift it but disappointed very badly. You can not make phone call if you are in outside. Worst product seriously. : (
Nice,5.0,The product is very good. Few points that i like about this product are1. Battery backup. You never run out of battery2. Less charging time3. Clear audio and mic4. Don't have bass too much that you expect from a music lover POVOverall nice product

grear product,5.0,overall great product unfortunately it stopped working after 11 months but i got it back as it was under warranty after warranty the product was great as it was before 2 years but now stopped working
Value for money,4.0,Best earphones I like it...  Sound quality is nice . But bass is low... Everything good for this price... And this is value for money... I got small problem for my product... I hope .. replacement product will be good ...
Ok type wireless,3.0,"Bass is good but response to the commands on given buttons is very slow, you can't access Google voice assist easily, and microphone is also cheap quality, you have to speak loud so that person can listen on the recieving end."
Great product with distant connectivity,5.0,"I liked the product as the sound is really good. Moreover, the connectivity is great. I can move between the rooms without getting disconnected. Color range is also good. I am satisfied with the product and recommend the same."
Nice product,4.0,Nice product
Nic sound,5.0,"Gys sounds is very good ,can choose it blindly,bass very good in Bluetooth system,if damage after receiving or before receiving that others matter,but sound is too good.but sure register after receiving online."
Not Working,1.0,It has stopped working after 3 months. Please exchange this. I bought this because of the branch image of Boat in market. But its not like I was thinking. Please exchange my headphones. I am totally dissatisfied.I have used the product very Gently. But still its giving problem. One of my friend told me that you can buy blue tooth headphones in 250 then why you are investing huge. I told him that this is BOAT. But I was wrong.
Worst product,1.0,First product get useless in 3 days replaced with new one and now replaced order not working at all. No customer care for warranty period.
Superb,5.0,It is worth for the moneyCompletely satisfied by it's functionality.The battery life durability is superFast charging üëåBass is also good

Excellent bluetooth connection,5.0,I can keep my mobile in one room and roam around in other rooms even outside the home without loosing the connection. Sound quality and bass are good. Call quality is ok
Don't buy it,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I ordered 3 but none of them were working properly, one is not charging, other one is not connecting and 3rd one is also not working. And now since return window is closed, I'm not even able to return it. It was a gift to freind and this product put me in very embarrassing situation before friends."
The best in thia price.,4.0,The extra bass put into these earphones are the best. I have most of every brands wireless earphones but the base boat gives is the best of all. Wire quality is slight less but those who care more about sound quality and base shouldnt bother. Range is little less than other but overall is good matte build.
boAt Rockerz 255,3.0,"boAt Rockerz 255, expected more as boat is better company , somehow this is not what I expected...but in this price range not much options."
Great option to buy in this price range,5.0,I have experienced one of the best quality of ear sets in this price rangeProsGood sound qualityActive noise cancellation is goodGreat build qualityCONSLeft bud gets out of the ear easilyNo mobile controlling featuresAt high volume u can only hear it for 30-40 mins
Worth for discounted prize,4.0,Worth at this prize.. connectivity is moderate some time get connectivity issueInterm of charging .. it's not managed effectivelyFor me coming 12 hr standby mode without on call ..I recommend they should improve this
Totally disappointed by not working and warranty issue,1.0,Within 4 months both the speaker got not working and I went to reclaim the warranty issue .They said warranty is not coming fpr whole product.It very bad by paying 2.5 k for this bad headphones
Pefect product,5.0,"Using it for One Plus 7T Pro.. Its compatible and no sound lag while using. Battery back up is also good. If you are looking some bluetooth in ear headphones under 2K INR, go for it.. best budget and quality."
4.5/5,4.0,"Go for it. Good during bike riding. One timefull charge will last for 3 days, in my case.This does it work.But Boat need to make more smart Bluetooth earphones."
Sound quality is not good and durability is pathetic,3.0,Sound quality degrades as time passes....ear buds always falls and there is a constant fear of losing them when you are out...and I got a piece which was open on his left circuitboard...initially it doesn't feel problematic but now I'm not able to close it....durability is not good
Good to go with this product. Quality and built is awesome.,5.0,It is as same as shown in picture. I am happy with same product. I received product which was faulty. But after reporting same amazon got it exchanged withing 3 days.
Poor build quality. Stopped working after 14 days . Claimed warrenty.,1.0,"Build quality is bad. Sound is just avg, nothing fancy. Battery is also ok-ok.Had to replace this after 14 days of purchase as it stopped working.However warrenty got claimed easily. Home pick up and delivery. 5 star for that.Again Stopped working."
Bad choice. Money waste,2.0,"I will not recommend this product. It has very poor battery life. When on call, voice keeps breaking & sometimes gives strange noise. Bluetooth range is also poor.It has been 2 months since i am using this product & it has started to show its true colors, even when it's charged it keeps disconnecting from my phone.Not at all satisfied.I would suggest to go for a better brand."
Top notch üëç,5.0,"Build quality is ok... length should have been a bit shorter...but calling quality, noise cancellation, bass & sound quality is top notch...so overall it's the best in this budget segment."

Bass boosted,5.0,Sound quality is superb unexpected bass in 10mm driverNoise cancellation is also superbAgain bass quality is excellent with bass boostedBefore buying this product I'm very confused between boat 255F and realme buds wireless but when I received this I was so happy after music listening üéß
Good value for money product,4.0,"Nice product at a price of 999. Sound quality and noise cancellation is good. Only problem I have noticed is that whenever it goes out of my Mobile's range, even for 2 seconds, it doesn't get connected automatically and I have to connect it manually again. Rest all looks ok.I am using it for 3 days now and battery life, call quality etc is satisfactory.Can't comment on durability at this stage."
Mic quality is very poor,1.0,Mic volume is very low. mic is place near to my mouth still other end people cant hear me properly.
"My experience with boat rockerz not good,",2.0,"I have purchased many times boat earphone(255,255pro) for my self and my friends but maximum times we all facing issue with boat product (earphone not charging/earphone one side not working).Need to fix this all thing ."
Worst product I have purchased,1.0,Noise cancellation is an big issue if we neglect that tooIf u answer the call through it first few seconds(3 second) of the call is blankIf you use this for phone call then plz don't waste your money on this
Boat rockers 255f pro,5.0,"The product is awesome but battery life depends on your usage according to me I only charge it once and I will use them for 8-10hours , cvc is 4.8/5,bass 5/5,fast charging 5/5, battery life 4.8/5 overall result is the product is awesome and it affordable too. price you will get it 1300rs-1600rs"
I like it,3.0,"I think the product is cool, but i need to suggest you people that while driving i cant hear proper voice and also the opposite person have trouble for the voice....so i dnt like that apart from it its a good product by boat"
Battery drains quickly even after full charge,4.0,Best headphones in this range . Close your eyes & buy if your seeing in range of 1k ! Battery backup is not that to the mark..  Orelse One plus ka earphone is quite good for 2k range with better battery backup
Satisfied with quality.,5.0,Got it at so much of discounted price and I am satiesfied with the product from boat.No complaints whatsoever.
In bettry indication there is 100% 80% 60%  but no 40% direct 20%,5.0,Product is original .Bass is awesome .Quality is best .Voice quality is also superb.But but but but but but but but...........Its battery like is quite little ..Amazone say that it's bettery is 6-7 hrs ..but ..4 hrs max .
Worst product and service,1.0,"Worst product. Sound is not at clear at the receivers end. So no calls are possible. I used this only to watch movies and videos. Cannot be used for making calls.Now it stopped working.They would say 1 year warranty. But when I tried to download the invoice copy, Amazone says contact the seller.Don't gonfor this product."
Nice,5.0,I had purchased  for my wife but ear plugs are big for her now i am using due to its sound quality is very good n i can connect to my tv to watch online movies n series on prime n netflix
For BASSHEADS only!!,5.0,I'm writing this review after 4hours of usage. I've used 2 boat products boat 225 and boat 900 before buying this one. And boat has impressed me with this one too. Im a basshead so people who like bass can blindy go for it according to me this is the best in the segment. Call quality is average. Battery life is goodüëç
Sound quality justifying price,5.0,I thought sound quality would be poor and i may have to return but it lives up to the expectations. Yes you do compromise in looks(for wire) but sound is really good and battery is long lasting so i think its worth it.Just use your normal earphone for BGMI NOT THIS ONE. its wireless so there is delay in sound output.
Product turns off automatically,1.0,This product just got disconnected from my phone many times then many times it switched off automatically. Product not up to the mark as described by the seller.Boat do fix this issue on your headphone boat rockerz 255.
Good Earphones,4.0,Over all nice product for normal useBought in offer at 999/-Battery once fully charged last for 2-3 days with 3-4 hours use per dayCall sound quality goodGood connectivity
Good Quality at Price Range,5.0,Bought two for me and my wife. We are happy with its performance. Charge lasts long enough for a day. Sound quality is good. This headset does not do much noise cancellation.
Not suites for calls on travel!!!,1.0,Noise cancelation is very poor.Recipient not able to listen anything while traveling!!!And battery backup is not as they claim.Just for calls it lasts for 2-3hrs max!!!Don't ask about standby time.... Standby time is also very poor.Not satisfied with this product...Not recommended!!!
Noise Problem,4.0,"Ordered it few months back. I like the product but after 3,4 months when am on call the other person some time other person faces  listening my voice clearly and it also catch other sounds alot . So am disappointed because spending 1500 on a brand product and then facing such issue is highly disappointed ."
Good one...,5.0,Product is good. But the package was not good. About the earphone i have been using it for almost 8 hrs now and yet the charge is still 100% bass is good and I don't know much about audio but build quality is good. And there is latency while Playing games ao it is not an ideal earphone for gaming.
It's  great earphone,5.0,This earphone of sound quality  is excellent and nosie cancellation is good and bass is very very good . Its battery lasts a lot . Under 2000 Rs  is best earphone..üëåüëåüëå
Not durable at all.,1.0,The sound quality and noise cancellation is good but the product is not durable at all. I have it for around three months and have replaced it twice. And now the third piece is also not working properly. Issue is after playing for some time the voice starts getting delayed. Then I disconnect and connect again.Update after using for an year:It stopped working. I would not recommend this.
Don't buy,1.0,Please don't buy this product(in fact any boat product ). after-sales service is pathetic customer care number never connects they put on hold they never give proper answers.
"Great product, great service, worth buying",5.0,Quality is very good in this price range. Bass is superb. I mostly use it for workouts. It does the job well. I face problem about noise cancellation as the other person on phone always complaints about unnecessary sounds from the sorroundings when I take a call outdoor. Service delivery from boat is amazing and satisfactory. They replaced my headphones after 3 months as one of the buds started sounding low.
Regret buying this.,1.0,"Writing a review after using for 2 weeks, pl don't buy this for voice calls. Not good at all. Huge background noise. It is not noise cancelling, it's a noise amplifying headphone.Took for calls, the other party cannot listen to your voice , only the background sounds are audible. Big regret. Worst sound quality."
Those who are looking for balanced sound.. Stay Away!,4.0,Sound is not balanced its heavy on the bassier side.. if you already had an expensive earphones like that of sennheiser's then go for this one only when you're looking for more bass because highs are not that well defined you'll need an equalizer to adjust. Overall for a basshead like me it's good.. battery backup is also great.. build quality is ok type. For 999 it's steal.
Money wastage,1.0,Bluetooth is very easy to connect but the noise cancellation is very bad.. Also after 10 days the sound quality decreased..I am not sure if anyone else is facing the same problem..  But i am facing it.. Now i am not able to hear any sound from one of its ear bud and from the other one it is very low..
Not sure,2.0,You can use atleast for three months.. which will follows by damage of one side ear piece usually the right side which happens in two of what I bought and another of my friend. Battery no doubt it's great. Can't connect to two mobiles or devices.
Not satisfied with the product !!,2.0,Initially thought it was good and bought later on realized that my boat earphones is creating problem like auto disconnecting. And even if it's connected it's showing disconnected ..few times i have faced audio issues . it's not even 6 months  that i have bought the earphones and facing all these issues
Boat Rockers Rock indeed!!,5.0,"Super bass at an affordable price point. Boat Products have always been on their top when it comes to the materials they use in making their products outstanding with regards to it's built quality,the texture the finishingAll in all superb product at this price point"
Just fabulous,5.0,"Guys go for it ,overall experience of mine is nice ,it even connects to 2 device but run 1 at a time."
Just wow product... excellent buying,5.0,"This is the best bluetooth earphones I have purchased ever. Best bass, though a crispness in the sound is required but still I like it very much. Bluetooth connectivity is also too quick and stable."
Average bluetooth,5.0,"Sound quality is not that good. After 70% of the volume, it fails to Maintain Sound Quality with Bass.. the Threble gets excessive.. and the Bass gets lowered and It creates ear Drum Very uncomfortable."
boAt Rockz,5.0,Good quality ear phones. Good build quality. Nice bass. Good back up. Will review again after some months of use.
Very good,4.0,"The bass is very good, that is the thing i disliked about the product. I want something that focuses more on the vocals and i wanted something with less bassThe quality of the product is good, looks premium. Fits well in the ear and everything. Battery seems very good,I am satisfied with the product"
Pretty decent buy!!,4.0,"For 899, this is a wonderful purchase. Sound Quality is good and the bass is decent. Nowhere near as bad as people kept claiming it to be. Battery is good. Lasts for 4 days easily. Comfortable to the ear and has a nice, stylish build. Loving it!"
Budget Bluetooth Headphone,4.0,Boat Rockerz has a great range of products and this has not disappointed. Sound quality is good. Battery life is average but one of the main problems is the buds drop off accidentally after some time and it is very dificult to find replacement or spares.
Read this!,2.0,"Battery life that is claimed by Boat is true. No complaints with that.Issue: After 30% battery or below you will get 'oops battery low' warning for every 1% drop in battery percentage.So, basically anything below 30% is useless.WORST! FEATURE EVER!"
My boat rockerz 255 sports is dead in 15 odd days,1.0,The sound quality was good but my rockerz lasted for just about 15 odd days. Suddenly it started getting charged and not responding. I am in a different city now. Not sure how the product warranty is going to help me
Average Product,4.0,"This an average product. Sound quality is good, only for music & videos. But not so good for calling purpose. Mic is not good. After 2 to 3 minutes conversation sound started broken and mic stop working. It is started from 1 to 1.5 month of purchase. This product is not for calling purpose. Even for the 5 minutes calling."
Bass quality,4.0,"Major asset is the bass quality and noise cancellation, good one under 1000 but may be we have to look up for the battery life as of now single charge I'm able to use it for 3 days"
Not worth the price,2.0,Got it for 899 still i wouldn't say its worth it.It doesn't fit well in your ears. Keeps falling.  The lock isnt that good.The microphone isnt very effective it dampens your voice.Since the voice cancellations is not good it becomes a task taking calls on this when you are on road
Best BL earphone,5.0,"I have bought this item in January which is 1.5 month experience about this product.It is one of the best product, very flexible, light weight, comfortable.Its sound quality is very good and battery backup is around 8 hour in rough used. Go for it friends"
Distortion in between calls,4.0,Voice is breaking in between calls and battery life is also not good as expected. But You can go for it if you are buying for music & also comfortable to wear. Better think about the battery life once before going for it. As per my overall experience I will give 4.2 rating.
Worst customer service ever,1.0,Product is okay but don't buy this because eventually when one of the speaker stops working and you want to replace they just turn their back on you I have been calling them and seeking their store for past 4 months and still they haven't solved my query so don't buy this product
Boat rockerz only not boat rockerz 255,3.0,It is not boat rockerz 255 because during connectivity it is connected by boat rockerz  only. After connecting I heard you are connected  with boat rockerz  only...not boat rockerz 255. 255 not heard by boat bluetooth.
"Good sound, mediocre mic & one earpiece stopped working within 6 months of purchase.",3.0,"Sound quality is good, noise cancellation is also reliable. The mic has issues, the other person on call always complains about my low volume & in most cases more background noise. After 6 months the right ear piece stopped working."
Needs improvement,3.0,"Sound quality is not good as i was expecting.Overall good product but connectivity as also can be improved, I'll suggest you to buy if you're going to use it withing 5-6 meter area. Good for calling and all.Overall good you can purchase if you want and you don't like the product like me you can return it within 15 days..!Thank You...!"
Very good!,5.0,"We have been using this for several months now. Flexible, easy to use, and has good sound quality."
Average,3.0,Very heavy for ears.. after 40 days it stopped working Metallic speakers makes heavy... Not comfortable while running..But some  light products... U can't returned it make huming sound  battery only works for 3 years
No use for calling purpose,1.0,Not for calling purpose....the opposite end caller will hear only your surrounding noises clearer than your voice....so it's a pure 100% for music... crystal clear sound quality....just go for it if you use it only to listen music.
Very Dependable Product,5.0,"Good connectivity. Sound quality is very good and bass is the distinct feature of all boat products. But on one thing I want to make you focus is battery backup, it has a monster battery. Just give it full charge and forget, to me this is the most useful feature. Overall very dependable product."
Great product,5.0,"Great product from BoAt. I already purchased a boat wired earphone and I bought this because of the experience from the wired one. I've been using for almost 5 months, no issues and  it works great till now. Another great product from BoAt. Very happy with this product. And also good packing from Amazon."
BEAST OF BATTERY,5.0,"Good sound quality, the most impressive thing is its battery life. I dont charge it for a week and use it 6-7 hrs daily. Its boat product so of course the sound quality and bass will be upto the mark and its really impressive in real life. In this price range its one of the best."
"Loved it, paisa vasul - becoming BoAt fan",5.0,"Loved this product, key reasons for me are superb sound quality, calling quality, Google assistant, music controls and long lasting battery (80% battery after 5 days of moderate use - I haven't charged this for the first time while writing this review).I didn't like long wire and lack of magmatic music pause feature."
"Boat Rockerz 255 Pro+ ""ROCKS""",4.0,Excellent product in this price range.. bass is high.. no sound distortion even with high bass.
battery backup was not so good,5.0,"Product was ok but not so good only bass was good.after use of 5 days I found that the earphone voice was not working in some apps & earbuds is in bad condition, battery backup was not good.i can used only 3 hr in my fully charged wireless bluetooth."
Material quality is so Bad,1.0,Wire quality so poorOnly in a 1 month its automatic broke direct inside of handsfree.So sad and don't buy please
Headphone is not working,3.0,I have purchased two wireless ear phones in the month of August 2019.one is working fine but the second is not working at all. This product is under one year warranty. Please help to replace this product asap
Earphone and Bluetooth are different things,4.0,It's really great with quality of sound at this money but if you want to use for singing it's not good..the song lag behind than that of the original track
Satisfactory,5.0,"I have just started using it. It pairs with two devises OK, but there is a glitch when paired with both the devices at the same time.Also, there is a lag while playing games."
Worthless,1.0,"Waste of money for 1500, I would suggest to add extra 300 for realme Bluetooth or extra 500 for one plus bullets. Sound quality not good. Bass not good. If you're a boat user from the start then you might not get the difference but when you use products like realme or one plus then definitely you'll feel the difference in quality."
Decent Product with one drawback.,4.0,"It is a decent product with good sound quality and pocket friendly. But one drawback is that its fitting is not that good in your years. I have used other earphones from BOAT and they fit perfectly fine, but these earpieces irritates me and I cannot wear them longer."
Far Better than big brands,5.0,"Nice product, looking awesome in blue color and. Sound quality is great.It's a indian product guys go for it you won't regret."
Nice wireless earphones in this price range.,4.0,"Very good sound quality, bass, NC, light weight. Bought it at 1586 INR.Battery backup is not upto 10hrs, could have been more."
Worst,1.0,Worst earphone I have ever used in my life... Interesting part is that they don't have any return policy for this product only replacement is available.. i purchased it at 1299 price and even at boat website price is 999 only...I feel cheated..
Failure on battery life indicate on mobile,1.0,"It showing battery ‚ÑÖ backup different on mobile, it shows full charging 100‚ÑÖ then we playback songs or videos up to 2 hr then it shows 80‚ÑÖ after 1hr also shows 80‚ÑÖ then suddenly shows 60‚ÑÖ after 30 min shows 40% and few minutes shows 20‚ÑÖ after 5 minutes shutdown earphones. It failed for showing percentage of battery life..."
Awesome headphones quality,5.0,"Nice headphone and battery backup is arount 6 to 7 hrsBut 1 droback this headphone ... Vibration alert call , msg not available..in this device.. Please improve it"
Sound quality not remarkable but build quality excellent,4.0,"Not great sound quality. The bass is over amplified. But its a comfy fit and does an excellent job in cancelling out external noise. Some of the JBL headphones in the same range will provide you with better clarity of sound, wherein the mids are well highlighted along with the bass. But if you like fo listen to music with heavy bass, then these are definitely a better pick. Boat makes quality products for the given price."
Rockers rock!,4.0,"Pros:1. The sound quality is great2. Bluetooth is awesome. The range is great on it3. The battery life is ok. But can be improvedCons:1. The calling sucks. The people on the other end either doesn't hear us, or there's too much disturbance."
Irritating recorded messages in the headphone,2.0,The prerecorded message in the headphone .. keeps on playing after regular intervals between the calls and it‚Äôs so irritating
Don't buy,1.0,Don't waste Ur money for that. I bought it in July 2019 after few months it's one side stopped working then I replaced it by company in feb2020. After few months it's again stopped working.this time I complained to company then company received product for replacement but didn't replaced I am still waiting for my replacement product since 1 month.
Waste,2.0,"I ordered first time, couldn't able to hear with right ear phone.. exchanged with new one, the issue with left ear.  This is not at all compatible with VIVO phones.. for samsung mobile it is good but vivo mobiles, don't go for it.. i tried multiple models"
Do not buy this as customer care is hopeless in case of any issues in warranty. .,5.0,battery  is not charging after 7 months. Customer support is hopeless in helping. They asked to send mail to somebody and they never responded back.  In 7 months product is superb in quality of sound is good and comfort. But I am unable to use after that.
Satisfied with the product.,4.0,Trust me my Navy Blue boAt rockerz 255 pro looks like a premium headphone.Superb bass the quality is audio is awesome. But still not like my wired earphone.(Mi bass boosted)Battery backup-: 4-5 hours ( i think it is enough)Over-all satisfied with this product.
Worst,5.0,Got themis product in the month of September..  It workes fine for only 2 months.  Now its not working at all. One side only is audible.
Quality not as expected,1.0,Pathetic quality

Good for the price,4.0,"Sound quality-GoodBattery life-Good,gvs 5-6hrs back upBattery left percentage doesn't works well,at the 5th-6th hours when battery is totally about to drain, percentage  indicator still shows at 40%"
Good product,5.0,Good quality earphones. Got for 899/- so at this price product is good to buy. And warranty replacement is also very good and customer valued replaced this one in 11th month and got new one
Useless earphones,2.0,Absolute crap! The bud doesn't fit properly. I got pain in my ear because I have to be on call 8 hours a day and it was the worst choice I made. It also kills some aspects of sounds and music and some sounds are lost when I use this earphone!!!
Poor customer service stop working after 1 month,1.0,Not worthy at all. I purchased coz of brand name only but after one month it stop working. I contacted to boat customer care but they are least bother to contact back. Poor customer service. They will suggest you to contact to boat customer service banch but its too far from where you actually stay.
Stopped working suddenly,1.0,I have hardly used product for 2-3 weeks after purchase and suddenly it stopped working and the sad part is I could not return this product to AmazonSo suggestions is that do not buy this product looks like seller sent the faculty product
Amazon customer care not response for warranty claim,3.0,Like : sound is niceDislike : product life span is very less around 7months only. now i ask warranty claim not support by amazon team also.Warranty card present to company means they doesn't accept it also they replies get ticket from amazon after that only we check its own Boat rockerz 255 product. but amazon customer care is not support to me.
Some weird sound from right ear bud( tick tick sound),2.0,Again some weird sound from right earbud...I fed up with boat..I already replaced 2 baot products( rockers 385 V2) because of the same reason and bought this one with that replacement money expecting some good product... again I was mistaken üòêüòê sad but truth...this will be my last boat product...
Value for Money,4.0,A very good product. Very lightweight as expected. You can't feel anything you wearing. Sound is very good. Crystal clear sound. Noise cancellation is good. And bass quality is awesome. I am highly recommending this product. At this price best sound quality.
Perfect For BassHeads!!,5.0,Bass is Unbeatable(9.5/10). It is almost comparable to Flagship Headsets. Noise Cancellation is Good(7/10). Bluetooth Connectivity is Little bit slow if you are connecting new Device for the first time but once connected it auto connects Very quickly.Overall a better package. (8.5/10)Under 2000 Rs. Budget must go for it!
Need customer support,1.0,"Left side of the ear phone is not working now and now the return gate is also closed, o don't see any option for service of this product, this is worst experience with amezon they simply take money from us for prime membership and cheat us like this, btw this is the first thing I bought after primememberahip"
Nice productüëç,4.0,Is the best in this price range. The only thing they should add that magnetic on/off in this BT neck band.... If they had added this feature then it would have perfect... I would like to suggest anyone to buy this product but price should be not more than 1000-1100... Thank you!
A very good product,4.0,Sound Quality : The sound quality is very good... Good baas... At higher volume the bass tends to overpower the vocals but at this price point the audio quality is very good.Battery life : takes around two hours to charge completely. I do not use it continuesly but it can give you around 6 hours of music playback and talk time included.Durability : around the neck design allows the earphone to be used freely... making it tangled free... durability of the wire is also very good.
Satisfactory neckband,4.0,"Boat earphones are good with battery and and fast charging. But the fitting in my ears are not good. I tried all the Budds but this is not fitting in my ears. And one volume button is not working properly.If it doesn't fit your ears, don't buy them."
Advice : NOT TO BUY : Stopped working.Poor Bluetooth coverage.,1.0,"Pros: Excellent sound quality for this price.. I would have not returned it, if it had continued to work well.Cons :  Stopped working 15 days from the date of purchase. Also, my phone had to be almost near the headphone for it to work well."
Shape of buds doesn't fit well in the ears,2.0,"Shape of the buds isn't right. It does not fit in ears well (I've made 4 people try it out). Also, it drops out even while walking.Sound quality, noise cancellation, bass is overall good. Colours are good. ‚úì"
Faulty product delivered,1.0,"Faulty earphones delivered twice, even after a replacementThe other item sent to me was faulty tooCharging suddenly drops from 80% to 0 within 5 minutesThere was no refund option available after the replacement999 wasted"

"Great Buy, Won't Regret the purchase",4.0,"I personally was sceptical about buying a Bluetooth earphone within this range and style. But they turned out to be fine. They have great connectivity and works fine when attending a call. Noise can be improved a little bit but at this range, the noise performance, feel of the product, style and small things such as earplug magnets are a great experience all together."
Excellent product with great quality and amazing customer service,5.0,"Excellent product with great quality and amazing customer service. After 8months I had technical issue with the product, dropped a complaint to the boat customer service, their response was amazing, they fixed it within a month with free of charge since it's covered under warranty. They didn't even charge for courrier. So far the service and product quality I would give 4.5."
Audio oscillations during phone calls.,2.0,Build quality poor. Battery Ok.  If phone call comes while watching videos  oscillations are heard and sound becomes inaudible and fluctuating.  You will have to disconnect and reconnect to get clear audio again. Using since 15 days.
Nice product,4.0,Everything is okay for me only problem is its ear buds. It's very painful when I use it in my resting time due to its design. Otherwise its bass is awesome. Sound quality is good
connectivity problem after a month..,3.0,After a month use it started having connectivity problems... and it got worse day by by day... try something else for this price..
Post sales support is pathetic,1.0,"Post sales support is pathetic, I brought this product on 1st October. Now i am facing the power on problem, this speaker don't power on though i have fully charged. It is switching on while charging. I am trying to submit the support request in Boat's website. while submitting the page says one or the other error and not taking further.I am totally disappointed with Boat's support."
Average,5.0,"Quality of the product is fine at this price range. However, it automatically disconnects from phone during calls if you get another call waiting. This is disgusting."
Good for calls but not for music,3.0,"I think this one of the best wireless headphone at this price range, my calling experience was fantastic, other person could hear my voice very clear... but i feel the music quality is not at par hence i had to return the product. I would wish BOAT can improve the music quality...Battery back is also very good..."
Value for money,4.0,"Purchased this product specially for calls and I am very much satisfied. Sound quality is good. No disturbance for the person on other end. Nice battery back up. Only thing I am disappointed with is its colour. It's not as shown, its bit dull."
Not long lasting,1.0,"The product was good but didn't last more than one year and couldn't be serviced after warranty,service center not looking to service even if we pay for it.Other competitors are providing servicing .Not upto the mark for the money spent."
Good in sound performance but failed in battery duration.,3.0,For 1-2 hr maximum after that for continue using you have to charge. Full charge in 20-30mins.
Audio reception low,3.0,I repeat purchased  this bcoz of my previous experience of good productButThis unit seems to lag behindThe general volume is lowTried to enhance it by settings but still audio receptivity is lowFelt very sad
SIMPLY GO FOR IT,5.0,Best packaging and also original product day before yesterday i purchased charged for more than an hour bcz its new prdct..its 3rd day today still battery showing as 60% üëèüëè‚ò∫Ô∏è
My device is not working as per description!,2.0,"My bluetooth boat is not as efficient as described, I am having trouble while connecting to my device.I can't hear voice of the person while I am on call. It says 1 year warranty, so I wouold like for replacement please let me know about further steps to be taken in this."
Value for money,4.0,"Battery life is good.Sound quality  is good.There is no additional  sound cancellation feature for this product like senhizer, Bose..etc.But its value for the money.Bass is good at this price range."
Just OK,3.0,"Working fine. Individual has to adjust its rubber fins as per their comfort. Batery backup is not as per expectations. When fully charged, its will show 100%, later on it will show 80% but after some more use it directly surrenders for low battery"
Worthy üî•üî•üî•‚ù§Ô∏è,4.0,I have mi Bluetooth earphone compare to that it's really awesome bass & noise cancellation perfectly worküî•üî•üî• value for money I buy this product 999 RS ..Go for it guys ‚ù§Ô∏èüòé
Not a great product if you‚Äôre are seriously looking for a clear sound and wuality,3.0,The expectations were high and totally disappointing experience after using the boats. The only positive about the product is the way the earbuds are fastened to the wires and the finishing. Wish it stays unlike my previous products be it a Appo or Jabra
A Must Buy if you're getting it at Rs.899,4.0,I got this on 30th sep 2019 for Rs.899 the black colour verient the build quality is ok interms of price. call quality is really good if your device is in close range the sound quality is where I'm not fully satisfied the bass is ok but the vocals and instrument sounds are not that clear it feels like the base is suppressing the vocals and other instruments sounds.. But I have to say for the price of Rs.899 it's acceptable.
Worst earphone,1.0,Sound quality is average. Bass is below average... horrible experience using this. After 2hrs of usage ears starting paining... Bluetooth range is around 5ft only after that it fluctuate. Noise cancelling is good. Wires are bit longer so it looks ridiculous. and on using this earphone on above medium level of volume it lasts for around 3 hrs only... Overall please don't buy it go for other options with lighter weights of earphones.
Battery is worst,1.0,"The battery doesn't last longüò§.After 3 months you can't connect to Bluetooth properly.Battery is so disappointing üòûIf you go more than 35 feet away,the sound breaks.My advice is to buy a new edition üôÇ"
Waste product,1.0,The quality of the product is very bad.2 months later after buying the product one if speaker stopped functioning.Bluetooth connectivity is also poor while you are riding your bike.Please don't buy this product instead prefer the mivi ones they are far away better.boAt ven won't clear your Warranty even if it is warranty period.Buy mivi thunderbeats which I am using currently.
Mic issue,1.0,The incoming voice is clear but outgoing voice call is completely inaudible on phone voice calls. On watsapp it's audible from.both sides. I have replaced it once on Amazon thinking that there might me some product malfunctioning but same problem occurs in replaced product too.
Worth Buying,4.0,It is very attractive and stylish neckband that I have ever used.It meets all the requirements for this price. Goodness is you can connect two devices at same time.Bass and noise cancellation is good. Don't overthink and just go for it... Worth Buying
Budget friendly,4.0,I guess this is the best bluetooth earphones you can get in this range. Only after service of boat is very poor. Otherwise all good.
Not recommend to buy this product,2.0,"On my personal experience with this product is not good . It worked good for few days and all of sudden issues are coming like sound goes off and all of sudden again start , Now a days the sound is not clear.All together not recommend to buy this product"
Worst Product,1.0,"Not even fit for one star rating..for few days it works well,then the problem start..Some time it doesn't connect to mobil even if I next to mobile..Sound nd bass qualities are worst...Volume button issue is there."
Product is good but design should change,3.0,"I ordered another product ""Boult Audio ProBass Curve"" along with this.boAt Rockerz 255 Product is good but Design should change similar to Boult Audio ProBass Curve.Auto-off is not available with this if we are not working for a longtime ."
"Great sound, great battery, bad noise cancellation.",4.0,"Great sound, great battery backup but zero noise cancellation. Very useful during calls mic is so clear, the other person does not know that am on an earphone. If noise cancellation was there it would have been the best Bluetooth headphones. No doubt in that."
Wastage of money.. kindly read this..,1.0,"I don't know what to say about this product...first i ordered it ,then on second day it stopped working then i returned it and placed order for second time this time earphones worked for 20 days then again it stopped working ...my worst product from online shopping till date"
Product is not up to the mark,4.0,"Althought the reviews on the product are good, the product is not upto the quality. The sound output is low and the bass is terrible. Battery backup is excellent. The bass is in a normal level and overall sound experience is below average. I suggest u to not to buy this product"
It's as average as it can be.,3.0,"Sound quality is very average. Battery backup is alright and about durability, one ear has already stopped working just after 6 months of use. I purchased Amazon prime subscription just to avail the little extra discount it had for prime members during August, 2019. Very disappointed."
"Super band, but very less area coverage",3.0,"The headphones are pretty good, but the distance it covers is very less. As soon we move out the area immediately it disconects and when we reaches back to attend a call, we will have to reconnect it again or attend the call without headphones."
Product in this range of price is quite impressive especially Navy Blue Colour,4.0,1.Overall Sound quality is pretty awesome but  when it comes to base it is 4/5.2.Due to the fast charging it's being very useful  to make product durable.3.Battery life gives upto 6 hrs a accurately when  u r watching or playing game.4.Sound Quality during call is pretty awesome.  Navy blue colour is way best than others.
Awesome battery,4.0,I like battery .it's just awesome and best option in this range and excellent in talking and listening on phone calls . Good sound system  and trendy. however product quality is not that much great .Mic is keep on coming out.but certainly a good choice .
Be careful. Its not the BOAT headphone you want to buy,3.0,The product starts giving metallic  sound after one week. . Too much interference in GSM band where mobile network coverage is not very strong.I am not able to use regularly this issue.
Good n quality product,4.0,The product is good and battery remains for 6-8 hours if u use continue...I've problem is only with voice breaking... Sometimes u will heard breaked sound... Adding this review after 4 months
Best among All,5.0,"No comparison with other neckbands.. deep bass, good noise cancellation, quick bluetooth pairing, high speed multiple device responses...All above long lasting battery life...I'm happy with the classy product."
Good for Music but not for calls,4.0,"Works well. Nice Batter Backup, Audio Quality n base. Best for listening music but not for attending calls. Noise cancellation does not work. The call recipient will hear a lot of noises and even the distant voices so loud n clear as if they directly fed from like.  Not at all for talking over phone. You can only use it for listening music."
Amazing quality ...best bass....long battery life,5.0,Very much satisfied with the amazing sound with rich bass.Very good battery backup.Battery last for almost 10 to 12 hrs which is more than they claim for 8 hrs.Got it in 999This is my second earphones ..Now I got it in 1399. But very much satisfied with the bass and battery life.Want to purchase again if I get it in that price again.
Bought for 899 during sale,5.0,Bought 255f pro + at ‚Çπ899 during diwali sale.Sound quality good.Bass average.Battery backup excellent.  Using it for 5 days continuously and still 60%charge remaining.Overall satisfied with this product
Worst experience,1.0,"I haven't used it for a month and already mic and LED indicator for charging are not working. I looked for nearby service center to repair / exchange as it is still under warranty but no luck, the nearest boat service center is 300 km away. Word of caution, check for service center near near you before buying."
Just average would be better. Need to pair multiple times to get connected.,3.0,Just average would be better. Need to pair multiple times to get connected. Noise cancellation is also average and sound quality is also average but battery backup is good.
You're not going to have an enjoyable experience if you really like your music,3.0,"The product really messes up the treble. Notes sounds very muffled and some high pitched beats are audible with only very little intensity. The bass is great though, you'll hear very energetic beat drops. The overall music output is still really substandard."
Good sound but uncomfortable to wear,3.0,Sound is ok in this price range but the bud that keep it stuck in ear is little uncomfortable as it comes in only one size. And the wire is also not so strong. It lasted a year for me after that the wire broke from inside.
Sounds really good but durability ???,2.0,This product comes with best in class sound quality. The bass that it delivers is just prefect. But on the other side the product does not lasts long. The one I purchased had a problem in the left earphone in 10 months. Good thing it was in warranty of one year. But what if it happened in the 13th month. ü§ûü§û It's good but is often interrogated on durability. Choose wisely.
POOR SOUND QUALITY_MUST BE AVOIDED,1.0,very cheap quality material within 3 months earphones are not working and customer support is avoiding customers..very poor support ..VERY POOR SOUND QUALITY..NOT AT ALL SATISFIED.There are Bluetooth wireless earphones available within range of Rs 200-300 with good sound quality than these earphones.
"Poor audio , no notice cancellation, waste of money.",1.0,"Bought it Oct 14, sound is very low even at phone and headset volume at max.  No noice cancelling facilit , no voice commands facility . It's boats sealed pack, not imitation, but the product not like  as  mentioned in description. Recommended not to buy this model"
Nice headphone,5.0,"Good headphone, decent sound quality, good to look but had been better if the neck portion would have been foldable/flexible wire, so that it could have been wrapped and kept in a pouch"
Stopped working the second day,3.0,"Got it in the prime day sale. Thought it would be a good purchase, Stopped working the second day only. They were only working when connected to the charging cable, quite ironic for bluetooth wireless earphones.Focuses more on bass. The band is very weak but it was worth the price. Disappointed as they stopped working only"
Not Genuine\Tampered Product,1.0,"I have received a tampered product ,single pair of additional earplugs , there was no cover on the charging point of the headphone ,the finishing on the body was not like a genuine headphone , returned request has been sent .thanks to Amazon"

Nice product,5.0,"boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ in-Ear Earphones with 40 Hours Battery, ASAP Charge, IPX7, Bluetooth Version 5.0, 10mm Drivers and Voice Assistant(Active Black) is the best ear phone for ever.I use from a month it give play time back up to 35 hours.I recommend to buy........"
Delicate charging point(rubber cover),2.0,"No doubt the sound quality is good, I bought two.of them.but one spoiled in just about  13 days and the other in about two months, not worth the price.The opening for the charging point is kind of attached to the.charging point and once my outside rubber broke the bluetooth gave way , the charging point also shook up (moved) and is not charging,."
Waste of money.,2.0,Product was good gives awesome experience while using it. But after 2 months left side of my earphone stopped working. And it's not the first time this time it's third time that one side of earphone stopped working. Now trying to return it but couldn't.
Honest review.,4.0,"It is good earphone , that gives you good quality sound, bass and notice cancelation.I got it in 899 and I think it is worth buying.Range is not too much, not  longer than 10m. I have dought about its battary back up.Now you can buy from other sides too at same cost."
Review of Boat Rockers 255 headset.,5.0,So here is my review after recieving this earyphone.1 Bass quality is really good and boosted.2 Sound quality is perfect.3 I got this earphone with 80%charging...I used them in 6 hour for a day.Charged them for 30 minutes.4 I think it is the best option at this affordable price.
Tempered packing,1.0,It's seemed supplier had unboxed it before because selaed was opened2 major issues1) within 4 m it starts to disconnect2) when connect to mobile battery shows 100% after while it's show lessIt's seemed supplier has placed used /faulted earphone
Great earphones,5.0,"Great quality earphones with good ear supports that dont let them fall off. Bluetooth connection so good that it catches signal even from two walls behind it. Sound quality is great and constantly giving 6 + hours of play time. Go for them , best for this price"
Battery is little drawback,4.0,Battery life is ok only 60 to 70 percentage.. within two days to three days it's getting drain.. but anyway charging time is not too much.. just in a hour or less than a hour it gets charged.. sound quality is awesome.. wireless option is so free feeling when compared with wired headset.. thanks
Replacement Warranty not honoured,2.0,Earphone stopped working after 3 months. Service center people refused to entertain warranty claim as it was purchased online and not in any shop. Avoid!
Not Bad !,3.0,"Sound quality is mind blowing2 star for this !2nd thing is battery backup, maximum 32hoursBut something which disappointed thats are look, build qualities, you have to compromise it.Over all product is good ."
Worthy product for this cost,4.0,This is multi purpose. It‚Äôs so good when listening to musics and also while talking. Would recommend.
Best for long hours but not for sound.,4.0,Best earphone till now. It's been 1 month after receiving it. Intrestingly i have used it 5 hours a day atleast (remember atleast) but it last for two days then also.Slightly disappointed by the sound volume. Otherwise nothing is better than this.
bad for gym,1.0,Its hard to do bench press wearing these earphones. also the wire is too long.edit :one side not working so I sent it for replacement. it's been 2 months and no word from them.
Too long wire,3.0,"The earphone is OK, OK. Sound and bases are good.. but the worst thing is the wires are too long, as compared to other brands.. it feels like a semi wired earphone. And it keeps hanging when we are not using it. Otherwise it's very good."
"Good for audio and video, horrible for calls.",3.0,"The audio quality is good when it comes to songs or videos. The only problem is with phonecalls, the audioand mic degrades quite horribly and I almost always need to turn off the connection and use other means.This was a major inconvenience over the lockdown period when you needed to have meetings over the phone."
Stops working in about  2 months consistently.,1.0,"Stopped working 4th time in 10 months now. 3 times i have sent it for replacement. Takes an average 20 days to come back after replacement by boat. And now boat has discontinued pickup and replace from doorstep service for this model, so inspite of the product being in warranty period i cannot use the service . If u want a product that will last a maximum 3 months then do go for it ."
Not worth it.,2.0,"The bluetooth connection is not very stable. The sound quality is below par with no noise cancellation at all. I understand that at this price tag, you can't expect much, but the least you expect from an earphone is a good sound quality."
Sound,4.0,"Awesome sound quality and product is still in good shape, quality and it's been a year long usage.Low volume controller button is not working from the day one but it's not much required for my calls."
Review after 1month,4.0,It is an amazing headphone in 800rs the sound quality is also wonderful.Noise cancellation is a little bit weak.But otherwise for normal casual listeners its WOWW!! .Just buy it.
Worth the money,4.0,"One of the best products in the 1000 price range. Good battery life, sound quality is awesome and very effective noise cancelation. The only issue is with Bluetooth. Doesn't have a good enough range. Sound starts cutting off after only 1.5 meters of distance from phone/laptop."
Don't buy it,1.0,"Don't buy it, after using it for a year, I found that it's battery life isn't what they claim. Mine only works for like an hour or two, and standby time is also false, it's battery can't even last two days. Sound has too much bass, not recommended for telephonic conversation."
"Worst customer service, worst product I have ever experienced",1.0,It Got damaged within a month. None of buttons are working.Such a poor product from boat never ExwpectedAnd when it comes in term of replacement which never happens. Following up with customer care of boat from last 10 days with no response.
It Was An Defect Peace,1.0,"This item which I bought is a defected piece. It works well for me for the first one week later it's not working as expected.

AS PER MY CONCERN NOW I DON""T DRUST AMAZON any more."

All other features like buildup quality, ear fitting, etc are above average. Not bed but don't compare with costly one. Finally one line- good one batter then all other brands up-to 2000-3000.

Worth of buying,5.0,"I liked the brand as it serves the product as exactly as it describes in the  package.. Besides it is easy to  use and provides complete nirvana as the brand claims to be. Buy this product, specially when you get any deal or offer when the price will be around 999/-."

As it have 1 year warranty, I informed customer care, but they didn't even acknowledge my request. Very very dispointed from a reputed company like boat. If you don't want give warranty don't mention it. Not gonna buy again from boat."
It keeps getting disconnected when in standby mode,3.0,"It ear phone dont seem to be some comfortable but that could be a very personal experience.After connecting the ear phones, if not used it simply disconnects. which is annoying to reconnect before picking up the call"
Worth buying - good product,5.0,The product is amazing....with good price...Sound Quality is superb...rest depends on the quality of sound tracks..Bass is acceptable.. neither high nor very low.... Satisfying... üëåüëåCozy and compact...ear buds are very comfortable..
Don't purchase,1.0,Product quality not good.
Good earphone at this price range,4.0,Writing review after more than one year. Woked fine in the first year but now voice not coming in the right side earphone. Managing with the left side earphone. Easy to connect bluetooth.
Overall the headphone are good except for the built in voice audio is irritating,3.0,"Overall the headphone is good.But the headphone has this built-in loud male voice audio that plays every time you turn off/on, connect/disconnect bluetooth, min/max volume."
Compare to JBL in this price Boat rockz. Super and I recommend it,5.0,"Sound quality is good,  Bass is excellent, noise cancellation is little bit poor,  if u charge 1hr , no need to charge 24hrs even I talk more than 80+ calls,  music play time I don't know.. I dont have time to listen music ,Compare to JBL in this price Boat rockz. Super and I recommend it."
"Average sound, good battery backup.",3.0,"Overall build quality is good. Sound quality of earlier purchase 6 months back is much better. In this item, the Bass is good , but boomy and treble is less prominent. Battery backup is excellent. Overall sound quality is average."
Great Buy,5.0,Sounds very good whether you listen to music or place a call. Got it for 790 during sale and its total value for money.
Wrost experience ever.,3.0,If you are a music lovers don't buy this because sound quality is very low I don't know why they made this.
Wrost product supplier,1.0,"Worthless product distorted sound, nice basss, fatela avaj, battery life was good at starting but after some days you need to recharge battery regular, when battery percentage was 60% or below it's behave like 0% and you need to recharge it, also sounds not good the coming from that little hole is like totally distorted."
Good product,4.0,"Overall good product. Not for 2 wheeler ride.. Noise cancellation will not allow to hear rear vehicles horn. Otherwise another issue is when you receive calls directly from the headset, it will take 3 seconds to reach caller. No more issue.. Good product at good price"
Good for only 12 months,2.0,I have noticed that boat ear phones stop working after about a year.. This has happened 2 times cannot be a coincidenceThey just stop working.. So i guess not worth the money if you have to re purchase again and again
Not charging sound quality not good,1.0,Waste bluetooth I hate it...not charging and sound is not correct....if Im connecting to my mobile sound quality is slow once I switch off and switch on its geeting...but twicely I have switch on it charging fort is not good...waste boat bluetooth I hate it.not even 1 month I purchased it
Opened seal + Unreliable bluetooth,3.0,"I wasn't able to connect with Me note 4 and Note 8 pro.After multiple attempts, it connected to Note 4. But it worth the hassle since the box seal was broken before it arrived."
One of the best wireless earphones in this price range,4.0,"Writing this reveiew after using it for close to 2years. No complaints till now performance wise. Only thing need to be improved is the design of the in ear support piece, it keeps comin off. So deducting one star. One of the best wireless earphones that I have used in this price range."
Battery charging issue .,1.0,"Within 3 months having issue in Battery charging and within 2 hrs battery get drained.Now Battery charging stopped last 2 days, so worst experience regarding Boat rocker headphone to me."
TORN OACKAGE WITH EAR WAX ON BUDS. DAMAGED PIECE,1.0,"Recieved a damaged and a used piece from Amazon. Pathetically disappointed with this. Already it was difficult working from hime now have to wait longer just to get a replacement. The package was TORN, EAR WAX WAS ON THE BUDS LITERALLY FELT LIKE PUKING. specially when there is a pandemic going on."
Value for Money,5.0,"After using for more than 6 months, trying one other device at 200 bucks higher cost, bought the second one for spouse and recommended 3 to colleagues, I can safely say boAt Rockerz is the best in all aspects."
"Rocking bass, not so rocking fit",4.0,"The battery is impressive, but the ear piece sometimes pops out of my ear. Sometimes it hurt the ear on wearing it for long period. The bass is good. For a person who loves bass this is good but who wants to hear all the content of a music, this is not recommended"
Overall ok roduct,3.0,"Ok productAfter 100 it got to 80 and then 60% and then completly gone.Software seems to be not acurate otherwise sond, noise and Bluetooth is ok. Overall ok to have in this range."
Collapsed...worked well for only 4 months,3.0,"I had purchased this on May 2019.. now it's October.. collapsed.. even though it has no noise cancellation on phone calls and big disturbance on calls, it had performed well for other like listening musics and others till last month. Then problems comes..first voice breaking during calls then voice breaking on listening music too..now right ear piece is not working at all.."

I got it replaced but the replaced device was a 2nd hand product given to me as a replacement from Amazon. Got surprised and upset with the customer service approach from Amazon.

Good earphone in range of 1100,4.0,Good qualityFits perfectly in earBass is goodFast chargingBattery backup is for one day for normal music and call throughout day
Battery Backup is brilliant,4.0,The best thing about this product according to me was it's battery backup. Used for many days without charging it. It just littlr uncomfortable to the ears. Can't wear it for too long.

Pathetic product,1.0,"Putting a fancy audio message at power on and off doesn't make a product good. Battery life is pathetic, doesn't even tell battery level which is more of a norm now a days,and it just goes off suddenly. Sound quality isn't great either. Disappointed."
Good and comfort.,4.0,"It's better to buy wireless. There is no theater sound experience. Build quality is good. After a long usage ears are paining. Charging very fast. 10 hours playtime is true. Good magnetism. Neckband is stiff, good and comfort. But, expected more sound quality. No high bass."

Base quality good in this range,4.0,The overall sound was good as compared to other in this price range. As i like more bass it has satisfied me more than expected thanks to Boat & Amazon.But the I'm not find any noise cancellation in this Earphone dissatisfied with that...
Nice earphones,4.0,"Everything is good at this price range, just one thing I didn't like was the length of the wire, boat should provide more long wires for the earphones as it hangs on your ear and neck, rest everything is very good, happy with the productüòÄüôÇone more thing is the quality of calling is not so nice, you can't hear voices clearly..."
Worth,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I bought this back band in 999. Over all this neck band is good in all aspects . Sound is good. But I miss some functionalities which other brands give for eg tracks changing buttons , auto disconnect on when both ear piece magnetised with each other."
Tanky earphone with killer Bass,3.0,"Bass is great. Built quality also. But sount quality is not that much good. Anyway good for rough use. Magnets are not that much magnetic, it's magetic property is wearing off.I am Waiting for boAt to release a earphone with RHA level sound quality."

For Music lovers,5.0,I like the headset with bass.. And this is a perfect headset for that.. Even the noise cancelation is good.. Only problem I feel is that the mic is available little bit away from the mouth.. So the voice is not that clear during calls
Ok Product.. get's the job done,3.0,Sound quality is par.. and the magnet is super loose.. not like the earlier boat rockerz 255.. I got it for 1099 but not worth the price . Go for if it you get a deal for 700-800 range

Best Battery time,5.0,Never imagine this can be used for one week on a single charge. Very useful for my office conversation 9 hours per day. Can be connect mobile and computer at same time. So very useful to manage my zoom and mobile calls. Weekly once only I am charging this. ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫
Dissapointment!,2.0,"An unexpected product from boat. I have an another pair of boat rockers 255 neckband which I purchased earlier which still has much better sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality than this current pair. I am dissapointed with the product."
1 step back from excellent,5.0,"Not embarrassing me even after one year of purchase. Completing all my calls from 6 am to 9 pm without disturbing. Good battery and well connected to phone. But one con is that, to whom you call, he can listen other sounds loud and clear around you."
I strongly recommend this for music lovers especially bass lovers,5.0,"Good headset. Value for money. Bass and music lovers best choise. 2 mobile connection with the heatsdset at the same time is really a great option.After 9 months of use, oneside speaker was not worked.

The product was damaged within 4 months,1.0,"The sound quality is great, cheers for that. BT is fine as well.But the build quality is low.The C type charging pin got detached from the headset board and I was not able to charge it after that. It was a disaster.

Awesome earphone,5.0,The product is very good with loud and clear voice and also a great battery life.Good for long time music and movies.
I'll  give review after some days,4.0,It's ok... I got it today... I'll let you know after few days üòå but it's sound quality is good... I bought boat wired earphone that was also good but  within one year that was not working... I exchanged that but also new one was not working after some days...
Please dont buy!!,3.0,After using for 25 days straught 4 5 hours daily i can say that this product is surely a waste of  money. It gets disconnected automatically and sometimes even after connecting we cant hear the sound.My earphones stopped working and i am looking for a quick exchange
It Saved the day for me...ü§ó,3.0,"Good quality...strong build quality. It fell down on a train platform accidentally and got stomped on by kolkata crowd. I had lost all hope of over getting it back in single piece, surprisingly it took no damage except two little scratches. I am writing this review after this incident."

Dont come for popularity only.,3.0,"I already have boat 510. It is just amazing in sound. Bass, durable and battery üîã life too.So that i went for boat 255.But it is too bad in battery life. Sound nd bass quality is also not upto the level of boat 510.I just totally disappointed with this boat 255.Just go for another. Dont come to it for its  popularity. Cosider zook and Boult products in this price range."
Good but not better than Realme Earbuds,4.0,"Boat rockerz is good in sound quality, connectivity. But when it comes in comparision with realme earbuds, then the boat lacks behind. In Realme earbuds if bods earbuds are connected with magnet then the audio stops and it saves the battery of the earbud. But when the earbuds of boat are connected with magnet the sound does'nt stops."
Good for the price!,4.0,"For the price these are good, the sound quality is decent, not awesome noise cancellation, but at this price this is one of the best in Bluetooth. The battery life even after using it for 3 months is very good, i keep them on the whole day and recharge them at night."
Looks good and standalone sound is good,4.0,"Standalone music/sound is very good but in phone call, it's bad and more so after 10 days of usage, it not working and contacted boat customer care and immediately they taken for repair now."
Good quality headfone,4.0,"Sound quality no doubt best in the market under 1500/- headfones. Noise cancellation not so good. Average. But once you cross 50% or above then noise cancellation kicks in. Sound clearity , bass, everything is good.  One can go for rockerz 255 pro Plus without any doubts."
LOVE IT,5.0,"So I‚Äôve always hated bud earphones coz they hurt and keep falling off, but this specific model is amazing!!!!! The curve near the bud holds the earphone steady and no pain at all. Love the sound quality etc. Very easy to use and you‚Äôll absolutely love it! So go for it :))"
One of the best wireless earphones,5.0,Very good sound quality. Works great with my iPhone as well as android phone. Easy to connect and good battery life.
Charging is not working after 3 month. Bekar product hai.,1.0,Sirf 3 month baad bhi khrab ho gya. Charging problem. And connectivity problem. Chrage lgne se rh gya. Koi bhi na le isko. Bekar ka product hai.
Worst product from boat,2.0,"product unsatisfactory and of poor quality. Even if you have not put it to maximum use, the hardware gets damaged after few months. I had bought 3 of them previously and would not recommend anyone to buy products from boat. Waste of time and money."
"Good value for money, especially at a discount.",5.0,"The earphones come in decent packaging, with a manual, two extra pairs of buds. On the lines of usage, the sound is pretty loud and clear, with the bass being a little low. The feature for having them attach together by magnets inside also prevents any mess up. At this price, it's a great buy, but if your budget is bigger, go for something better, probably the Bullets Wireless."
Not worth buying.,1.0,This product is not at all worth buying.It's a waste of money.Sound quality is pathetic.Build quality is like cheap earphone.Battery backup very bad.Bluetooth connectivity is the worst thing in this product.
"Good quality earphone, best to be max ROI",5.0,"Been using these for the last month now, I am satisfied with the sound quality, even the battery life is good. I had read only good reviews about it and I must say, not faced even a single problem till now. Would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a decent quality earphone with an optimized price point."
BADLY DESIGNED ..NOT RECOMMENDED,2.0,"The headphone makes very  loud and unpleasant propmt sounds on switching on/off battery low etc..Also the battery life is low..The ear phone starts making continuous warnings once battery comes down below 40 peecent itself...Overall, a badly cocieved earphone..NOT RECOMMENDED"
Quality,2.0,The product was not bad.Sound Quality :- PoorNoise cancellation :- GoodBass :- Good
Good Sound & Backup,4.0,"Sound quality is good and playback time is also decent but earphones are not comfortable at all, just slip out without those supports attached &"
Awesome Product,5.0,"Wonderful Bluetooth Earphones for the price, the sound quality is equivalent to my wired LG earphones and the fitting is good too(my wired boat earphones used to easily slip out of my ears) and for the durability will have to test for at least a month, for now they look good"
Poor Power back up in 1400 cost range,2.0,I rise replacement of the product coz of power back up it works only 6 hour with call and 2 hour music..Let's see after replacement..... Coz there is no return option also... It's really not good
Battery backup üëé,3.0,"Not happy with the battery backup bcs as they committed 40hrs battery back I don't think It work 40 hrs, problem in connection between two devices and noice cancellation is not working properly, other wise design is good, like the feature of quick charging, sound quality is also good."

Third class product.,1.0,"This product is just opened now. Totally used one. Cheated...  No Charging cable,  Earphone missing a grip,only one pair spare earbuds. Totally waste. Avoiding is better."
Recommend product,3.0,Though it is a good shift from wired earphones to a Bluetooth earphone. And the bass level is also good.. but sound clarity is not very good.. but in this price point it is recommended product.I use it daily for 2-3 hours and charge it on every 3rd or 4th day.
Bang for the buck,4.0,"One of the best budget Bluetooth headset. It has a decent amount of bass, a bit lacking in volume. The passive noise cancellation is great. The product is definitely worth it's price. The delivery was fast too."

BoAt Should fix this issue.

Battery üî•üî•üî•,5.0,"Battery,üî•üî•üî•üî•üî• I can't work without headphones now I charged this 3 daysbefore I have still 40 percent left,best headphone in best price I have one plus even though I didn't buy one plus headphone because I'm a fan of boat"
More u use more u love.,5.0,Highly recommend. Battery  life is remarkable. Sound is also good. Passive noise cancellation little downside of this neckband
Boat Rockerzz real rockerrrssss.......,5.0,Worth for money. Excellent battery backup. I have been using it for almost 10 days still the charge is 30%. Amazing sound quality. Only issue is the design. Its not portable at all. silicon in place of rubber would have made it the best among all.
BATTERY BACKUP AND BASS IS SUPERB.,5.0,The backup quality is absolutely fantastic and guys believe me i do charge it in 8-10 days .Bass is also good. Those who are looking for good battery and bass I suggest this boat rockerz 255 pro plus. Far far better than oriamo bt headphones as of my personal experience.
Dont buy this from AMAZON,5.0,"DONT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON OF YOU WANT BUY FROM BOAT STOREI got used item not a new one after replacing item ., I'm not expected from boat very very poor quality., I think this may be from worst sellars ,Sound quality and bass quality is very worst .,"
It's superb,4.0,"It's superb in quality yet I returned it, for the weight of the product seems uncomfortable, going for oneplus. Still it is nice one, don't get confused, if u like bass then go for it, it's calll quality and connection is very very good"
Good Product.. worked 1 year..,4.0,Awesome Product.  Used 1 Year 2 months.Now stopped working...Bluetooth connects and fine. Both the side not hearing any sound. Buttons are working fine.1 year worked with no problems.
Boat 255 one side is not functioning.,1.0,With in few months one side of head set is not working.  I am not able to find service centre in chennai and in online centre green and black model is also not displayed for selection.
Nice product,5.0,"Product is very good but given charging cable is defective so using mobile charging cable, Bluetooth connectivity is good but anything like your hand comes between headphone and mobile, you may feel some disturbance in connection"
Noice cancallation is not good,1.0,Background voice is easily audible for other person its very Annyoing While talking...dont buy these product...only sound quality is good one so i gave 4 star..
Doesn't fit in properly,4.0,"I don't have any particular negative reviews on this, except the fact that it doesn't fit into the ears properly, at first, it kept falling off and even now, occasionally I have to press it to make it fit in there. Everything else is up to the mark."
Amazing Sound quality,5.0,Loved these bluetooth earphones from boat. It has amazing bass sound quality and comes with fast charging also it is so good for gaming experience it does not cause any lag in game. I loved the color and overall quality of this earphone. Totally worth buying.
Great Product,4.0,"As expected makes life easy with two BT pairings with a single device, Voice clarity is good but Noice cancellation is not as expected. Otherwise Great product for its cost & better then competition"
Worst & faulty product and no service,1.0,This is  worst product and don't buy it. Within 4 months I faced the speaker issue and replaced in warranty. But again in 3 months battery is not getting charged. I sent mail to imagine marketing id but no response. It seems that they have only faulty product. Also replaced product in warranty is used one. Worst product don't buy it.
Best in segment,5.0,"Best investment I have done in wireless earphone till now. It offers great bass with noise cancellation, pairing with phone is way too easyBattery backup is also good . If you are lover of edm and heavy bass music then this is for you go for it"
Value for money.,5.0,"If the usage is excessive don't buy it coz after a certain period, itching starts n feels uncomfortable in your ears, But if u r going to use while driving or just for calls then it's recommended, the sound is crisp n clear mic works perfectly fine in excessive clatter, the battery is also long lasting."
Worth buy,4.0,Boat rockers is good in quality and sound is also good and battery life is so good. This neckband is worth buy. But neckband is band shape is changed in after 1 month but they can't broke but shape has changed but neckband is good or good to buy..

One bud stopped working after 3 months,1.0,"I bought this headphone hoping that it would be sturdy. I generally use headphones while travelling listening mostly study related videos. So bass is not a selling factor for me. While it has good sound quality, it is really fragile. I kept this in my office bag  for my daily office travel ; used mostly while in commute. After 3 months one bud stopped working."
Waste of money,1.0,I am really surprised how can people can suggest this product. The sound quality is so poor that you can't even listen a song. The sounds quality matches with old music system with no bass and vocal clarity. There is absolutely no bass and sounds like I am in sitting in auto and listening to the music played in the same.I can't be priced more than 200-300. A third grade product.
Excellent product,5.0,"After a long search finally decided to go with this product, Getting slight distortion while receiving any notification and noise cancellation is OK other than that I love this product very much, it is too comfortable and audio quality is excellent, at this cost it is an excellent product, worth for money and highly recommended, Thank you all for the reviews and Thanks Amazon."

"The other side person will not listen you properly during the call, you have to lift up the mic.",5.0,"During the call, the other side people will not hear you properly you have to lift the mic and hold it till the time you're speaking. also there is no direct contact between PH and headphone so you can't play the FM. Rest is all gud. Sound quality is better."
Not at all satisfied,2.0,"cons:1. range is too less2. consistency is poor, sometimes work okay sometimes very bad3.

Go for a better brand."
Good product worth Rs.999,5.0,"Good product worth Rs.999. It has all the features I was looking for. Sound quality was good. The grip of ear buds was excellent. The appearance was good.

Connectivity problem,2.0,I purchased the product for 999 and I don't find it that useful as the sound doesn't come even when the phone is in the pocket.

great product but too long neckband wires.,4.0,"The product is great at this rate(999/-).Bass is awesome.Quite good noise cancellation.Battery backup is fab.But the wires connected to neckband are quite too long, it keeps floating left-to-right while walking(if u haven't plugged into ears & it's simply hanging by ur neck) and makes ur walk uncomfortable/weird.Still u can go for it. Company made no compromises on quality."
Mid performance,3.0,"Received scratched product, although didn't returned as it doesn't create any impact on product performance.Very poor quality in noise cancellation. It provides terrible experience while receiving a call.boAt should definitely improve this area."
Base rockerz,3.0,"I have been using it for past few days, sound quality and call quality is good. Sound is highly emphasized on base, so base lovers will love it. The only problem I give 3 stars is that there is a connectivity issue. When we play some videos or music the audio comes out from the speaker even though the earphones are connected to it. That's the biggest flaw. Otherwise it's a great product at this price point."
The best in this price range,5.0,"I go to gym wearing these earphones. Sound quality is good and they didn't stop working after a rough use in gym. Sweat and weight, they have gone through it all and still working. Adding this review after two months of use."

Overall nice product but..,3.0,Overall the product is good but quality of earbuds and ear holders are pretty average but comfort and quality wise it's good if u are okay with these issues then go for it!

Good bass and clarity,4.0,"Overall good product in terms of sound quality and bass. Though the cords a bit too long,  keeps on dangling , could have been a little more less in length for more stability."
"Short life, Heavy buds and Limited connectivity.",2.0,"This earphone is a classic example of discomfort in all the senses. Firstly, the plugs are substantially heavy and also bear a bad design which makes it painful to wear while sleeping on one side. Secondly, like any other cheap earphones, this one also suffers from the common problem of one plug going dumb in a short span of time. The cherry on the top is that it cannot be connected to Ipad."
Superb quality Indian product,5.0,This is good and Made in India  I bought it for my office purpose where I can hear conference calls on laptop or on mobile and it works very well however it works on only one device at a time.
Best earphone with mic,5.0,"Best earphone with mic nice sound quality, noise cancellation best other people notice that you talk on mobile or earphone....most important hands free if your long time talker or working in office then this is best option to do multitasking.Around my 5 friends using same product no issues 2 earphones are 6 months+ old no complaints."

Less value for money,3.0,I had ordered this before 1 month. After using this I realized that its sound is little less so I need to play the music on higher volumes.

Even battery is very average. Just not happy with product which I had huge expectation. Built quality is below average."
Duplicate product received in original packing...,1.0,Duplicate product received in original sealed packing...Plz quality check before dispatch...
Uncomfortable while wearing,4.0,"Its uncomfortable to wear,also very long  neck band sound quality is good otherwise"
Not happy worst Bluetooth device,1.0,I cannot hear the voice of the person clearly in this Bluetooth device. It was properly working at the beggining but now when I am in a call its frequently disconnecting so for that I need to restart the device again.. Similarly when I am listening to music.. Its disconnecting again and again. This is very irritating. So expensive things are not even working for 1 month. Dissapointed.
Bad experience,1.0,I purchased the product on 15th October 2021. Today that is on 10th November it is not working properly. Battery lasts only 3 to 4 hours. The company claims for 40 hours. Now I will return it. Very bad experience.
Sound Quality,4.0,"Some times sound lagsBass is good but could be betterIt gives u premium feelVery light weight,You have to handle with carebattery life is also goodNOTE: If you are purchasing it for playing PUBG mobile then dont purchase any of bluetooth earphones go for wired ones.You can see some videos to know more about PUBG gameplay with bluetooth earphoneAt last posting some pics do check it out.üòäüôèüôèüôè"
Facts,1.0,This product is highly disappointing. Please do not order this. They show some other pictures to us and in reality there's something else. Walk out and take from retail shops they are way more better even if they charge more. But they don't give us fake product like this. Highly disappointed. Never expected this from boat or Amazon.
Worst after 5 month and they don't giving warranty,1.0,"üñïüñïWorst products I purchased boat rockerz 255 active black after 5 it get defective..When I applied warranty for it then didn't reply my mail, call, and registered for pickup they said dilvery is not available at your area and no services centre available under 50 km.. they don't reply.. then what I do...üò§üò§ü•∫ü•∫ please help me.. anyone üò§ü•∫ü•∫üò§"
Worth the money.,4.0,Worth buyingPROS: Battery life is the best. Multi device support.Cons: sound is just loud on max volume so better use in mid volume. Some times there is audio lag  while watching videos so have to disconnect and connect again.
Good but not value for money,4.0,I did not find any noise cancellation...i can hear some external sounds when playing games..bass is comparatively good .not excellent
Backup time only 2.5 hours,2.0,"Product is just ok. Drawbacks: 1. Back up for only 2.5 hours only. Tested even it was just bought. Now after 3 months of usage coming to 2.15 hrs approximately.  2. The neck piece of the set is so thick and the length of wire is long then the need ,which overall looks not handy and flexible."
Poor Quality Headphones,1.0,The product is faulty and has started giving me problems in the 3rd month itself.The Bluetooth gets disconnected automatically and there are freequent disruptions while trying to use the head phone on voice call.Overall very bad experience and I would not recomment anyone to buy this prodcut.
"Only for music, not very comfortable for calls.",3.0,Soud Quality is Ok okBluetooth connectivity for single device is good.Cons -Connectivity with devices has problem sometimes.Noise cancellation is worst.I get robotic like voices when I am close to metal body even though my phone and earphones are just 1 feet away.Same happens if on call when connected to two devices.
Best product at this cost in terms of sound quality and bass. But not so handy in usage,4.0,The sound quality is awesome. Noise cancellation is also good.Battery time is about 6hrs. But there is a rapid jump from 60% to 0%.The main drawback is that it is not handy. The neck band is plastic like material so that it cannot be carryed is pocket. Carrying them in bag is difficult.
It's a decent product,3.0,"When you buy this product and use it for 2 to 3 weeks the overall bass,sound quality is good but when you use it for 2-3 months the sound quality gets badder and badder and its only 6 hours playback so that you have to charge it regularly and when compared to other bt earphones this is not good one"
Good sound quality bt low product quality,2.0,"Noise cancellation is zero. Call recipient always complaints that lots of background noise at my end whenever I use this earphones. I am using OnePlus 6t which has best noise cancellation feature.Today, post 19 days of purchase, charging nt happening, led not turning red or blue, heating up in a minute while charging.I don't know where to complaint and get this replaced."
No voice in one ear plug. Not satisfied,1.0,Very disappointed with quality of the product. No voice in one ear plug. Earlier I have also encountered with same problem. Plz take care it will malice your image.

Sure...,5.0,"Good one guys... Go for it. Haven't used much. Bt 1st impression is good, especially bass quality.Value for money"
Don't buy üòÇ,3.0,"Everything about the product is good , but the product won't last for long time , initially the left ear bud stopped working and then the right one. If you're looking for a device with longer run time then this isn't the right one. Though it's cheap and offers great quality in the beginning , it won't last longer than a year."
Over smartness of microphone is useless.,3.0,"noise isolation is good. But when we are in call or recording something, microphone catches even very small sounds from the surroundings. This will be very bad experience for the user at other end. I think this over smartness of microphone is useless.  Otherwise this will be a very nice product in this price range."
smart buy,5.0,The product as a buyer i am fully satisfied .. and if u ask me whether to take or not i will say go for it .. at this price i can say its the best you can get .. the sound quality is quite good .. Bluetooth connectivity is best part of it you can hear  around whole house so you don't need to take phone while you're in home .. and noise cancellation is moderate ..  overall  excellent product
Battery life,1.0,"I am using since last month battery backup not so good.At first I was getting good Battery backup but now day by day Battery is so much draining so fastly, If I speak only 3 to 4 hrs after that Battery is going to die,But sound quality is so good üëç"
Good product..,4.0,"Good for easy listening. Using it all the time, even during my evening runs. Fits well. Doesn't come out of the ears while running."
Mediocre,3.0,"Though the product has a standardized and pre-eminense, the 8 hours battery backup makes it a complete failure. Along with it, the unwanted noise cancellation feature and the inbuilt sound feature somewhat makes the product annoying."
Avoid this product,1.0,Used it for almost 1 month now it even doesn‚Äôt charge I don‚Äôt know what the problem is! Its under warranty but service centres are too far.It would cost me the whole amount spent this earphones to get to the service centre now.

Excellent though short lived.,4.0,"Somehow, the life of the earbuds is very less. While the company immediately exchanges the product, you have to take the pain of going to the service centre and do the formalities. Wouldn't want such additional stress."
Need replacement,1.0,"We had booked 3 pieces of boat Bluetooth devices 2 red and 1 black. Box which had black device was damaged and bar code label wasn't found. But found those in the red devices. We worried about whether the black was original or not. We have opted for the replacement and kindly replace with the new black one,if not we are ready to approach Consumer Court. Please replace the product as soon as possible."

Worst service,1.0,"It was good device, but charging point broken after 10 months , tried contacting boat no response on warrent tried calling them sent couple of mails no response did not expect this at all"
Good sound and bass.... But zero for noise cancelation,3.0,Overall good sound quality.... Delivered on time... Received Good product in good condition.... I bought it for 899.. But zero to noise cancelation... My family complaining that they hear more sounds in background clearly than my voice
Very bad  product Big disappointment.very bad customer Service,1.0,Very very very bad it's been only 3 months and it's one earphone is not working . One year warranty is useless no service centre service is there for help only waste of moneyLet me tell you that don't buy this. Yes it's true that it's the best product you can get for the price (I doubt that) but definitely it's not the best product YOU should buy.Big disappointment....0
overpriced,3.0,"Sound/voice breaks when you use it while brisk walking , running ...also voice/sound breaks when you keep your mobile in backpocket . Good to use when you use it at still position .Should come with aux point & cable so that can be used while it discharges"
The buttons are opposite placed...like volume - button is upside and volume + button is down side.,4.0,"The buttons are opposite placed...like volume - button is upside and volume + button is down side.Call quality is not good, i was using 255 and the call quality of 255 is better than 255 pro +."
Value for money,5.0,"Awsome.product but some hiw built quality is not so good got damaged within 1yr but sound quality was just awsome njoyed a lot, used this product like Bitch"
After 7 months of use Happy to become a Boat family,5.0,After 7 months of use i am happy with the headset. but when the right side ear piece was not working i have raised a complaint to boat site and they have replace the entire headset. It takes 3 weeks for the process. But they have replaced the entire product.
Average product,4.0,"Guys product feature are good but services related with warranty is worst. My product got some complaints and claimed for warranty, its almost one month, there is no feedback from their side. So dont buy this product if you consider warranty and services but product features like sound, bass, connectivity are good though."
Nice for 1 year,4.0,"I bought this headphone on the month of March 2021, till now, it's working well..............But, in sometimes, it's not connecting on laptops and phones....But I like this product...............Next, nothing to say anything......Thank you..."
Good earphones at this range!!,4.0,"Sound is good, Noise cancellation is good, some very rare time the other side of person is unable to hear my voice which may b due to my mobile network not sure. One thing designwise i wanna mention here which i little feel uncomfortable is the size of the earpiece which bulges out so much tat when wearing Helmet it gves a lot of pressure inside the ears from the helmet and it becomes air tight üòê If Boat can make it little sleak or small in size!!"
Best sound quality earphones quality of material is superb,5.0,"I used this from last 2 years best sound, boat is making for music. Best sound and also material quality is so best in 2 year no any complaint from this 6 to 8 hrs backup daily ,i love it value for money product thank you boat....üëå"
Best product in this Budget at 1500/-,4.0,"The sound quality, bass and in-built mic are awesome. But the only reason I gave 4 stars is because I was not satisfied with the packing service by Amazon. The product could have suffered damage in the way. So I advice to take care of the packing quality.Hope this review helps you. Have a Nice Day!!!!"
Sound Quality good but bad product Quality,4.0,"Bass is best. Noise cancellation is enough. Battery backup is also enough.But quality of this product is not that good.Within 6 months, one side of my earphone stopped working and after few days even the other one stopped. Custom support expects us to go at the nearest office for claiming warranty."
Worst product i got to replace it within a month,1.0,It's quality is some what good but it get distorted within 25 days and i got my replacement today which is not boat Rockerz 255 pro coz I can't connect it to more than two device and it's sound quality is poor than the first one and my money gets wasted.
Good,4.0,"I'm reviewing it after using above 1 month. It's very good looking, durable, smart looking Bluetooth headset I think. Connectivity and sound quality is good. not very good quality bass,but in mid range volume it is very clear and value for money product."
Good sound quality with decent built quality in this price range,5.0,Good product in this price range battery backup is decent good bass sound is clear noise cancellation is good but mic is not so impressive wire length are lit bit long bluetooth range is only 10 m
Really liked it,4.0,Overall this product is excellent. The quality of sound and earbuds are awesome. Really liked it. Only reason for not giving 1 more star is that sometimes it have disturbance in connectivity. I think this is some bluetooth issue. But that happens rarely. I'll still recommend this product.
Very nice product,5.0,Mauka milte hi khareed lo
"Too much bass, but rest is fine.",3.0,"I'm not too much of an audiophile but I do look for proper instrument separation, clear vocals and a good bass.The bass is really overpowering. If you're into that, then great but I honestly hate it for that.However, battery life is great! And seems pretty durable. Fitting is good, with 3 bud size options. Pairs easily."
Value for money,3.0,Item is as it is like in picture. The base is high. It is not fitting in years comfortable. It coming out. Sound quality is ok but not too good. It is not pausing on contact of both ends of ear phones.
Build Quality Is Very Poor,1.0,"Very poor build quality of the product. After just 14 days the left side earbud has stopped working. I have a other pair of Sony WI-C200 bluetooth headset, which even after 1 year and 3 months is still working fine. I am not buying any boat product again in my life."
Disappointed,3.0,For listening music it's good but not for calling because opposite person is complaining frequently for Distorted voice..
Nice Product Value for money,4.0,"I am using it since last year I must say worth buying it. I have bought it for @ 999. Easy to carry, I personally use it in the gym during the workout and all the time when I travel from home to office."
I like it,5.0,Very nice product i like it. They are working in proper condition till now. I am giving very late review but working properly right now
Cheap quality product üò≠üò≠üò≠,1.0,This is totally useless product. Iam unable to talk with anybody due to low sound quality. Please don't buy this cheap product. üò≠üò≠üò≠
Low quality,2.0,"Ear locks are easily fail out,funnest thing is its not available in market if you lost this ear lock.. i lost one of my earlocks.. tried to search online, local makets shops. No one is having this."
Dont buy this neckband.,1.0,"First received headset was used one, and so i returned and the replaced headset stoped working after 55 days of usage. DONT BUT IT.""POOR QUALITY"""
Bass Monster,5.0,"I buy rarely onlineWhen I buy I analyze everything thorougly and deeply.I am vey much satisfired from quality, and sound specially bass.Excellent piece.You guys rock.Thanks"
Not original product,1.0,Not original Productaftr 2 months its stop working.boat service center denied to give service as its duplicate product.Amazon customer care also denied to help as its not their responsibility after 8 days of purches.Such bad experience with this product and seller Payal.
Best Headphones with proper Bass,5.0,The review is written almost after 2 years but I would say One of the best headphones when it comes to sound. Nothing changed after usgae of 10 years product looks new now also.
Not up to the mark,2.0,"You can get a better other headphones in same price. It's hard to use , charging takes lot of time, overall not a good product"
go for it..üî•üíØ,5.0,Simply go for it with no 2nd thought. It's value for the money ...Sound is clear and loudness is enough even in crowded areas. Phone calls are good and no irregularities in voice reception. Overall satisfied with this product from BOAT üòÄ
Good product in this price,5.0,Giving review after using 7 months. Battery backup is very very good. Sound quality cannot beat other brands in this price
Product review,4.0,"I bought this product three months ago, and until now I'm satisfied with the performance. It's battery life is amazing, one single full charge can last upto days if your use is average hours per day.Sound quality is good bass is little on the low side. It has water and sweat resistance, makes it very easy for me during exercise, without the fear of damage to my product.It comes at an optimal range, buying it is win-win."
Overall ok but...,5.0,Sounds quality is very nice...it has a good bass and the build quality is also nice considering it's price but the range of connection is very poor... Even if it is very close to the device the music gets cut a little which is annoying sometimesEdit: I exchanged the one I received with a new boat rockerz 255 and this one has no issues. The one I received earlier was defective...Changed my rating from 3 stars to 5 starsüòÉüòÉ
This Earphones has no APTX,4.0,"If you are a gamer and want this Earphones I suggest you to don't buy this Earphones.Because this Earphones sound delays in games like Bgmi or Freefire.But the earphone quality is very good,the music quality is also good."
Good all-rounder.,5.0,Beat BT earphones go for it best sound and best noise cancellation. Good for students and music wow. Great battery life upto 7 hrs with 75% volume. Good remote control can take calls and and change the tracks. Good for calling also. Good mic I love it.
Average,3.0,Just bass Is good other that it was worse. It lacks of instrument separation & when we kept the phone in pant pocket song will breaks(it will play like a loose connection in the wire). If you are in outdoor and taking calls you had to put mic near your mouth otherwise outdoor sounds will be heard by another person instead of our voice.
not good not bad,3.0,Overall its a good headset.. but it have some major drawbacks.. as a music lover i felt that the bass is good enough but the other things are a bit low. and while playing pubg and using voice chat it automatically reduces the surrounding sounds and i can't hear footsteps and gunshots clearly.. so i think these two are a major problem.
USELESS PRODUCT. NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL.,1.0,Not worth the price I paid. I bought it looking at the reviews. But I believe it's useless.Sound quality is very poor. It's deep and not clear.No noice cancellation happensThe plug support are so very low quality that my ears started to pain because of its hardness and non flexibility.The string is too long which hangs out upto your tummy.Useless product. Do not buy it  based in reviews.
Buy a light weight headphone,2.0,"Please read it before you buying1. Sound quality is good but not loud enough2. Battery is good3. Bluetooth connectivity is good4. Wire is too longBut the main part, it is a headphone and you should put it on your ear, but believe me after using 10 min you feel pain in ear, frequently it fall from ear, it is not light weight so it irritating your ear and head. So please buy a light weight headphone to do the main job."
Sounds nice,4.0,It connects effortlessly via bluetooth..The response is also good unless you're playing pubg there's a second delay in response..Other than pubg the sound response is good..
"I bought it for 999, very good product",5.0,"Writing review after 9  months of usage. dont buy these headset go for mi sport. these are getting problema very frequently. one side not working. But i like the boat service. they are replacing the product. and one more annoying thing is it will take about 20-25 days to replace product. my head set got dameged for 2 times and replaced it. too bad quality. coming to sound quality,base, and battery its unbeatable for any other company."
Excellent Service from BoAt,5.0,BoAt is very trusted brand. I received genuine product but after 7-8 months of usage one side of earphone stopped working and I raised a ticket for the same within 7 days the defective earphones were replaced by BoAt. You can trust on this product it is goodüôÇüëç
Nice,3.0,Im buying this second time now.. it's good.. but my blutooth speaker got damaged in 8 month.. bcz it was in warrenty pereiod I replaced it.. but sound quality is good.. ya battery life is not good.. after some months battry becomes low soon..
No product support,1.0,Pathetic product. Charging port broke within 2 weeks of use. Customer care didn't reply to email. No one picks up the phone. Don't go against your common sense to buy a product that comes without any support system.
Very Poor Noise Cancellation,2.0,"Pros:Easy to useGood quality material usedConsNoise Cancellation is very poor. The person on the other side of the call will hear person speaking next to you in a public place, rather than you. I'm extremely upset with this and hence would like to return it.Ps: Doesnt make sense to save few bucks and buy a sub standard product, instead opt for some other brand"
Not Much As Expected..,3.0,"Not an disappointing product, but i expected more after reading previous reviews of this headphone ,Good sound quality and bass, good battery backup .But connectivity was not as good , it's randomly disconnecting and connecting.Bluetooth range could be better."
Unable to hear my voice other  on call,1.0,Unable to hear my voice other person on callI have been using this headphone for seven month even company says this headphone has 1 year warranty but I can claim my warranty even I have just use this headphone for 7 month please don't buy it's  waste of money
DO NOT BUY THUS PRODUCT,1.0,"I am not really happyI bought 2 earphones and both are defectiveAmazon and boAt both are unable to help and solve the problemWorst service from Amazon never expected this kind of service from AmazonPlease do not buy this productProducts are defective when you buy during  ""Sale on Amazon""I give zero rating for the service and product bought on Amazon"
Worth the buy,4.0,"Very decent quality and build is very light can't say 'the best' but still its a better competitor for this price range and sound, pretty much happy with the experience extended bass effect and to say in simple "" ITS A WOW"""
GOOD PRODUCT AS PER PRICE,5.0,"Sound quality is goodBass Quality is upto mark with price and passive noise cancellation is quite goodBeen 3 months using going smoothly40 - 50 min charge goes straight 8 to 10 hrs, if 2 devices are connected it drops to 4 to 6 hr"
Excellent earphone . Charging wire too short,4.0,Great earphones! Best one according to price IMO Excellent bass noise cancellation and Charging is quick and playback is long. Deserves 5 Stars. But! The charging wire is very short it is barely 4-5 inches long so keep that in mind spare ear plugs something also given . 4 stars
Low quality of mice & connection problem,1.0,"Disconnects frequently & magnets are useless. It won't pause the music, & finally mic qualite is worst nead to shout to hear our voice in call"
Value for money,5.0,"Got this for rs 999. Such a steal! Although battery life should‚Äôve been designed for more than 6 hours, I got no other reason to complain. The red colour looks really good. Go for it."

Audio does not switch automatically between calls,1.0,"The audio does not switch automatically between calls, when try to switch manually also it takes speaker as default, having bad experience"
Not sure if duplicate product was delivered,1.0,Product was having battery issue from the beginning and used to have unusual sound disturbance even when battery was more than 40% charged. Earphone used to get heated a lot while charging but I ignored this problem and continued to use the earphone. Now the product is melted due to overheating. Lost ‚Çπ1500 . Pathetic
Good,4.0,Overall good product
Right side earpiece is having 0 sound,1.0,"Overall product is good, but one earpiece is having no sound now, this is the main problem, not expected from boat such quality problem. Please change the headphones and give me another one as there is product issue within 2 months"
Good sound,5.0,Best in class bass and clear sound. Only drawback is charging of 6 hrs which is quite less compared to others in this price range. Apart from that product is awesome
Worth it.....,4.0,Pros-1) very good bass in this price range.2) Mic is working perfectly well.3) Easy to carry due to less weight.4) Easy to use in gym.Cons-1) Battery life is less than 6 hrs.2) Wire length is given more.
Little disappointed,3.0,I mean i gotta charge it for approx 3 hours and then for 6 -7 hours and the battery is low again üò∂üôÑ that is really annoying that u have to keep on charging for so long üò™u rather opt for other ones available ....
cheap product - cheap quality,2.0,"This product is not good for listening to music.  The sound quality is very poor. This can be used for doing only a phone call.As the price is cheap, the quality is also cheap. I don't recommend this to others."
As expected,4.0,"As expected nice product I'm happy with this product,sound quality and bass is not too good but ok battery long lasting is good noice cancellation is also good."
Stopped working within 15 days,1.0,This one does not work after few uses. I got exchanged and the new one also stopped working abruptly. Bass is good but what‚Äôs the use id you only get to use for less than 15 days.. very disappointing. I think it‚Äôs better to she‚Äôll out more money and buy from company that is reliable.
Paint is off. Received a used or duplicate one perhaps.,3.0,"The paint one of the sides of the earphone is off. Probably I received a used or a duplicate one. Unhappy with the purchase. Since it was a birthday gift and I have already gifted it, I can't replace it. Very unhappy. The birthday boy is not happy. Not good amazon!"
Battery backup is up to the mark...,4.0,"Battery is best ...Connectivity is best...Soun is also best......Only.....wire is weak than price...And Battery/Charging system should be good in neck band side not in middle of wire....for strongness of device.......,Over all good...."

A must for all 2 wheeler drivers to take calls and listen music on the go,5.0,"Excellent product with good sound quality, voice quality, call is clear with air noise cancellation while driving. Blue tooth connectivity is flawless. Easy to use."
Worst seller and product,3.0,dont buy it.. i have purchased this in may 2019. i was getting an issue in left speaker in september2019. i have submitted for replacement. it will take one month to come back. again now i am facing an issue with button like i am not able to pick up the call if i press the middle button then it is getting disconnected. so again i am putting for replacement. dont buy from this seller.
Nice product with great sound quality,4.0,"I have purchased this product 2 months ago now after using i can say this nice product in this range...sound quality is good, just need to improve battery life bit more,once you charge you will get 2-3 hrs maximum backup.You can add only one device at a time although there are other Bluetooth headphones comes with dual connection.There is no magnet or any kind of knot so you have to be very careful every time when you are not using"
Fake boat,1.0,"Fake product, don't purchase it.Connectivity issues are always there and no customer service provider from boat will help you or replace the product..Worst service, worst product.All money wasted in ads. By Bollywood celebrities no money invested in customer services..Fake boat products and services."
Comprising quality of product .,3.0,"Too Bulky, Cheap quality of plastic, Gap in case where battery is placed can lead to moisture penetration.Lacks balanced sound, Bass is too much which suppresses treble. Better to go with Dizo (charging last less in comparison but good in quality in every aspect)."
Bad one,1.0,"As a sports scientist and fitness trainer, I have started Started my online training sessions so I got my blutethooth earphones in the beginning I was happy with this but after a month suddenly it stopped working and I dont know what's the reason also... feeling veryyy bad about that... please help me with tis"
Worth the price,4.0,"The product is highly light weight, suitable for joggers & gymnasium freaks. Also since it is Sweat proof & water proof makes it highly compatible with the above mentioned users. The bass is terrific. The noise cancellation is up to the mark. Supports Google Assistant with a one second press of the power key.Got it for 1499 just a little over 24 hours of order.'v'"
Average deal,3.0,Overall its a good deal in the price given. I think the noise cancellation could have been better.Also if you use continuously battery doesn't last more than 4 hours. At times it becomes irritating as despite having headphones you wait until you go back and charge it. Did not help in long travelling hours. Keep a wired headphones with you if don't want to be bored when the battery goes off.
Don't buy. Worst product,1.0,"I am writing the product review after i got replaced. This product sound quality, bass is niceBut its range is worst. Sometimes it gets disconnected from device, its battery performance is pathetic. I strongly reccomend not to buy this product."
Try it in all way within  its return period...,2.0,Good but bass is not that good. I mean I hear it very clear but not loud bass...and it turns off at 20% battery . not showing correct % of battery charge left.Now its charging only 80%(8-3-20)

Very very Bad Battery life,1.0,Battery life sucks üòë.Works only for 1.30 hours after full chargeUpdate:Even after full charge works for only 15 minsSend product for exchange and it has been more than 20 days.

Not poor but good,4.0,I bought this wireless headset in great Indian festival ok for 899 but u can go for Boult good in sound quality 800 only. Boat is also good. The choice is yours.
Not so good,3.0,Not so goodI bought this before 2 months and it's working good but sometimes get problem with mic. We cannot hear the voice of person who has called us. So for that I disconnected it from device and again pair with it.  This problem i have face 4 to 5 times.
Charging port not working in the very first time. Doesn't supports any cable,1.0,Worst thing is it's not getting charged for the single time. Completely waste of money. I would suggest others to Dont even think of buying it. Cause you'll try charging first after 7 days and you cant return it so... Rather regretting better choose something else

Best budget Bluetooth headphone,4.0,Best sound quality and perfect one under budget just go for it.*Edited*Posting this review after one year of purchase. For one year it worked perfectly..after a year one side of the earphone stopped working and after few weeks another side also stopped working..you can't expect a small electronic device like this to work for 2- 3 years. So you can definitely buy it without any hesitation.
Worst product,1.0,I purchased it on 30 January and within one month it is not working properly.. Voice is coming very low from the earphones... Moreover I didn't get warranty card from amazon sellers Not received  any support from amazon so strong no to purchase this product ....
Does not connect 2 devices simultaneously and mic quality is poor.,1.0,Does not connect to 2 devices. Once it is paired with one device can't pair with any other device. Mic doesn't work properly. The other person can hear but with very low volume. Also when on call people can hear the background noise louder than the person on call.
Product usage,1.0,"Worst product every purchase, don't recommend to purchase. It stopped working within a month!!!I don't understand why the company is selling such a low-quality product. Zero durability and service centers are distant!!! I need to travel more than 1 hr to get it to change and even I don't know if it will be done so"

Rather buy Sony C200 than this one,1.0,"A sheer disappointment when it comes to connectivity and battery backup. At this price I don‚Äôt expect the sound quality to be that of Bose but oh boy, it‚Äôs a shame. The Sony C200 gives much better sound quality and battery back up than this piece of junk."
