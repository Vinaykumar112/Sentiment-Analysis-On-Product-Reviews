A big no from me,1.0,"1. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.2. Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.3. Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.4. No return policy, you will have to live with the phone you didn't like. Now you decide."
Put your money somewhere else,1.0,"Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn't support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE"

Worst camera quality,1.0,"Worst camera quality. It is like 2 megapixel camera. Photos are very worst. If you slightly zoom the photo,  you can see blurry...Previously I used 13 megapixel amera phone. Those photos are very good."
You get what you pay for!,4.0,"I've noticed alot of people pay Rs12,000/- for this phone and expect the qualities of an high end Samsung galaxy Z; that should'nt be the case, you get a reasonable phone at a reasonable price of Rs.12,000/- It got 6GB ram and 128GB storage, the display is large, the build is sturdy, the processor is octacore, it comes with side fingerprint scanning, has a amazing battery life, has Dolby for sound, its made in India, the only drawback would be the camera, its not great...but it's not bad...bad per se. I think a samsung in this range is fantastic...its user interfaces is amazing...better than oppo and vivo that come with hundreds of chinese apps that acess your data back to China. I've used a samsung for years...the phone never caps out,  if you have a good cover and screenguard...you can use one phone for over 6 years easily."
No 5Ghz wifi band,1.0,"No 5Ghz wifi band on this mobile, miserable in 2021 , even my previous mobile of Samsung which I bought in 2017 have 5Ghz wifi , it's a big comedy"
Dont buy samsung m12 mobile,1.0,very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon
Cheated,1.0,Don't received  handset ejection  pin  and manual.
Hitting issue,1.0,Hitting issue
Worst product with cheap quality material.,1.0,Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
Good one in this price segment.,5.0,Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it's very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation.
Below average,1.0,"Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price."
"RUBBISH PHONE, WANT MY MONEY BACK",1.0,"PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
Perfect phone with this price,5.0,"This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company."
Not recommended for Jiofiber users,1.0,"Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI."

 #m12,#m12unboxing,#samsungm12 ,#unboxing ,#Samsung, #Galaxy, #M12,#SamsungGalaxyM12M12 unboxing videoNot so impressive Mobile from Samsung, currently direct compete with LGK42, Moto G30/G10To All people who want to purchase mobile DO NOT go on Mobile Marketing and Actors endorsing Mobile.:Remember 5G is coming hence you are getting so much discount on all 4G mobile. Mobile manufacturers are clearing stocks, Need to inform 5G mobile support 4G band but all 4G mobile will not support 5G.Take example, if you purchase 20,0000 mobile today, after 20 months you may need to change to 5G mobile hence it will cost you 1000 per month (costing matters) and you will not get High exchange value (not even 50% cost), Currently 5G yet to come in India, may be yearend or come will be high cost.Points to Remember while purchasing Mobile:1) Mobile band support, Dual Wi-fi Support is better.2) Graphics PPI matter hence check PPI value of mobile. It directly related to Mobile display and colour quality, Higher is better.3) Check Mobile camera F value (lower value, higher picture quality) if less than 1.8 is best. Mostly camera quality depends on Focal Value not on pixel4) Android upgrade support. This is important as your mobile will useless within 2 years, remember you don’t want any mobile who cannot upgrade to Android 11.5) Item Weight and height of mobile. Lower is better, it really matter as you will get pain while holding mobile for long time, specially  old people.6) Mobile resolution, Higher is better7) screen refresh rate, Higher is better8) Clean Android installation. This is also important as manufacturers cannot force you to install or retain any app.M12 /Pro6000 battery (not fully tested yet)Android 11, v11.0 operating system, One UI 3.1with 8nm Power Efficient Exynos850 (Octa Core 2.0GHz)90Hz screen refresh rateSamsung Brand (Non-Chinese)Galaxy Store supportDolby Atmos support.

Very poor performance,1.0,Dislike
Value for Money,4.0,"I bought it @10,499 INRDisplay is TFT but not that bad irl unless ome is switching to it from an AMOLED display. 90Hz doesn't feel so good and I don't expect it to, for the price given.Rear Camera is excellent for this price. 48MP mode catches very good details. Dynamic Range is exceptionally good. Portrait mode is sometimes hit or miss.Front Camera is decent. Not too bad, but can't say good either.Battery is obviously very good as this is 6000mAh. I bought it for my uncle and he only use it for Calls, Banking Apps, Streaming Music(Wynk) and 1-1.5 hours YT. It easily lasts him 2 days on a single charge of above 90%.OneUI has all the useful features and very responsive. The UI feels so nice while navigating through. System apps open without any delay. Best thing is that it comes with Samsung's own Dialer. I used it for few days before giving it to my uncle and it never felt like it's slow or laggy(I don't play games). RAM Management is very good. I'm a rough user who doesn't care about closing apps and I use many Social apps at the same time. It never felt like it's being slowed down and never faced any lag or delay even when using multiple apps at the same time. For instance, if a system app opens in 0.2s when there's no background app and if there's a lot of apps open in recent, even after that that system app will open in 0.2s unlike other UIs which generally start to delay app openings. That's the consistency and stability of OneUI that I love.But not everything is good in OneUI. First of all, the setup process tries every possible way to push ADs & bloats, like hiding the option to untick recommendation and promotional services in such a way that one can't even imagine where it is if he doesn't know already. Then it asks to install some bloatware on the name of recommended apps. They all are already checked and the tick mark appears dull as if it can't be unchecked. One has to manually untick all and click next. After all this, the setup process is complete. Even after doing every possible way to avoid ADs & bloats, I got welcomed with a bunch of bloatware like Moj, Josh, Takatak PhonePe, DailyHunt, and many more already installed. After uninstalling them, two permanent notification appeared. One was from Samsung side and other one was from Google Play Store. They both were asking to complete the setup using wifi on the name of Configuration update. None of them mentioned what will they do. I clicked ""Use Cellular Data"" and they both started to install more bloatware. Play Store installed 9 apps (most of them were Microsoft apps like LinkedIn, Office, etc.) while Samsung again started to install Moj, Josh, Takatak, BYJU's and many more crap. Most frustrating thing is that there's no option to cancel it. If mobile data is turned off, they start again when connected to it. After half an hour, the notifications disappeared and I uninstalled them again. Next day, a Software Update was available to be downloaded (Security Patch). It again installed 3 bloatware. This is so annoying about OneUI. Initially, MIUI was known for ADs and bloatware and OneUI was clean. Now it is just the opposite. ADs are frequently pushed in the notifications through Galaxy Store which again, asks to install those short video apps.I'm rating it ⭐⭐⭐⭐ only because of this. Otherwise, it's really a very good phone in other aspects."
Very bad self camera,1.0,Self camera is just like 2 mega pixels.
Samsung UI/UX is the worst,1.0,"The user experience is pathetic on these cheap phones. Its filled to the brim with bloatware that you can't remove.You're better off getting the Mi phones as they have a far better UIAlso, I can't return this garbage of a phone as Samsung don't list this as a software issue.I'll have to look into installing lineage os and de-google this phone before using it but that's easier said than done."
Not a good budget phone,2.0,"Product specifications are not at par..Display is below average.Camera quality is just okay..It doesnt support 5ghz wifi, which is not mentioned anywhere so please make sure before buying.."
Good battery but average performance,3.0,Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn’t give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you’re choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you’ll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review
Poor from Samsung,1.0,Just for name sake Cam & Battery are 48mp & 6000mah. But coming to reality it is poor. The weight of the phone also almost 250gm so it is not a smart phone it is a hard phone. And the top menu bar beside front cam is not responding sometimes.
It's a budget package. A good phone to buy in the ₹ 10k bracket.,5.0,"A very satisfying  experience with the device so  far.Pros:1. Long battery life-  I am a moderate  user who does everything  except gaming. That said , the battery lasts up to 2 full days.2. Decent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.3. Very responsive finger print sensor.4. Good sound quality, although dolby's impact  is not much pronounced5. UI is great and snappy. Lots of customization options.6. The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate. It does make the difference.7. Fast charging works fine.Cons:1. The weight of the phone is on the heavier side @ 220 gms2. The display could have been a full HD+ @ 1080p3. No led notification light. All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screen.Overall, a good package."
Horrible product from samsung,1.0,Horrible product
Just a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached.,1.0,Look is average. Battery life is good. Only go ahead if you just need a good brand name otherwise 100 of options are available in market. You will definitely get disappointed with camera which is actually not more than 12 mega pixels.  This phone nothing but a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached. Samsung must call back these phones as it is definitely going to kill the brand name. I will highly appreciate if Amazon has the guts to publish this review. This is an open challenge to Amazon...
Disappointed,1.0,"Not a good mobile.Quite heavy in weight, you will obviously feel it. Weight is 220 gms which is far exceeding acceptable range. Can definitely be used as paperweight.Nothing special in screen, processor or camera also.Just a marketing gimmick by samsung.Stay away.. At 13.5k we deserve far better than this."
Worst Samsung phone,1.0,"This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information."
Everything is just lit at this price🔥 . No complains about anything,5.0,"It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it 😌. Once again no complains regarding anything."
Worst camera,1.0,Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
Samsung M12 Mobile Phone Problem,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I don't know why Amazon is compromising on its quality to deliver  product's,  its evident nowadays, Recently I have got Samsung M12 product on 7 April 2021 the exchange date is 14 April 2021 ,Now after 7 days this phone display is gone , there is a blur continously in the screen,"
"Disappointed with mobile, Gpay & PhonePay app has issue",1.0,"Disappointed with this mobile.... PhonePay & GooglePay apps are not working properly.... Numbers visible only half and getting overlapped....and we're end up typing wrong Pin numbers.... multiple times we have changed the Pin for these apps... now a days We regularly use mobile for online payments but this mobile is not useful for online payments due to app issues.We have tried to return this mobile, but Amazon return policy date was over by the time we found the issue."
Budget Samsung Phone,5.0,I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about it.Positive points -• Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it• Battery backup (6000 mAh) is amazing even after using it throughout the day• Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light• Large display having a size of 6.5 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings• 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth• The phone doesn't lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 (8nm) high-end processorNegative points -• Not made for hard-core gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics• The weight of phone is heavy• The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones• The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels• The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range• It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection .~ I am satisfied with this phone because of it's camera quality and battery backup √
Phone is ok but can lag alot at time...,4.0,"Camera - sensor is ok, ppl writing the reviews do not know how to take pictures (i have taken some sample pictures for proof).Performance- after an year of use the phone seems to have periods where they hang alot.Finger print reader:. Pretty good, i have not faced any problems so far(been more than a year)Ui- keyboard bugs alot where it appears over the writing bar... That gets inconvenient at time.Overall verdic- for 12k this is the best phone i have used... Don't expect too much extra crispy perfromance from it...😶 If u broke like me go for it"
Go For It,4.0,I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
You will be disappointed,1.0,"Amazon hid all reviews for first few days till most of the stocks are sold out. Then after that it is not allowing to write negative reviews. I wrote my experience with so many negative points and it rejected. Still I am writing the pros & cons again.PROS:▪︎UI 3.0 is amazing. I like it a lot. It is better than Redmi, Moto, Nokia UI. (Subjective)▪︎Amazing battery life. I am getting more than 24hrs of usage after fully charged.CONS▪︎Worst camera ever. True 48MP is all bulls**t. Low light pics are also worst.Front camera is also not good.▪︎Seriously??? No Slowmotion, Timelapse & other basic features in camera.▪︎It doesn't support Camera2Api which means I cannot download GCam.▪︎Worst Screen resolution. While everyone is giving Super Amoled display & Full HD display, what happened to you Samsung??▪︎90Hz refresh rate is just gimmick.▪︎8nm processor is also waste.▪︎While all others are giving Snapdragon processors, Samsung is stuck with its Exynos which is basically useless. Phone is hanging sometimes.▪︎Phone is a bit heavy and you'll have a hard time with its weight. It's like holding a powerbank.▪︎15Watt charger?? Samsung...upgrade bro.▪︎Wifi only supports 2.5GHz band and no 5.0 GHz bandFinally dont get decieved by True 48MP, 8nm processor, 90Hz refresh rate and other gimmicks. You will be disappointed. I am very much disappointed. The worst thing is there is no return option in Amazon. Amazon bro...you too planned everything so well. Good job."
This is my honest opinion,4.0,"Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that's what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad's 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called ""true"" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4☆"
PHONE NOT UPTO THE MARK,2.0,"The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box"
Better buy a brick!,1.0,Don't know if I could get more disappointed by a purchase!!The phone did look okayish in the spec sheet. But it is a very  stupid buy.The first thing you notice is  the IMPRACTICALITY of the phone.It is too heavy(220g) and too thick (about 1cm) to carry. The display is the worst anyone could get at this price point.The processor is reasonably slow. Face detection is a joke. Battery is 6000 mah but will take forever to charge. But the side fingerprint sensor was good .Camera was okayish. Add a few more bucks and buy a better phone with OLED display.
Regrettable purchase,1.0,"They have conveniently skipped mentioning it is not an amoled display while mentioning 90 Hz refresh rate. Touch response is faulty on these phones and SAR value is high despite having exynos processor, which also they have conveniently skipped mentioning."
Poor Quality..MONSTER FOR BUYERS??,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I had received this phone on 09th May 2021. For first two days it worked ok. (OK because this phone is very slow)BUT on third day, 12th May 2021, it was hanged very badly. It was neither getting switched off nor restarted..!!Immediately I have contacted the customer care for its solution. The Amazon representative has responded well and helped me to book technician's visit, which has completed on 15th May 2021.Amazon is ready for its replacement according to their 7 days replacement policy and hand to hand replacement.It was a traumatic condition for me as I have bought this phone in this COVID pandemic in very urgent condition and I badly need a phone always working 24X7 as my family was admitted in the hospital.Also, people who wish to buy it for its Camera then please beware as Samsung is advertising it as TRUE 48MP QUAD CAMERA but its result is like 8MP blurred one.Second thing is the phone is very slow and its UI is frequently NOT WORKING.Third thing is its speakers are giving old radio kind of noise.Luckily, there is no option for rating it ZERO or NEGATIVE star, else I would definitely give that rating to this product.There is ""No Return Available"" and only replacement option is given by Amazon.Only positive thing in this entire incident is that I have bought through Amazon and got their prompt support.I am very much thankful of Amazon as they have replaced this faulty device with new one on 16th May 2021, means within one day after technician visit.Now, I am only hoping that replaced SAMSUNG M12 mobile may perform to atleast ""OK"" level, if not to ""GOOD or BETTER"" standard.Dear Samsung, I will edit my review with positive points if I found the replaced product upto the mark..!!"
Blown away by M12 impressively,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Battery life has just blown me away impressively... A great screen and a good processor... I play heavy games on it. I'm just loving it so much. 90 herts refresh rate at this price... Feels even better than my one plus 7 pro and I feel no difference between this and my s21 ultra"
Pathetic customer support,1.0,"I bought the phone for my mother. Her usage is limited to making calls, the phone stays idle all the while. She had one more requirement that I shouldn't have to recharge it regularly. Hence choose this 6000 mAh battery phone. I was happy first few days, it gave 4+ day battery life but then an update came and spoilt everything. In 12 hours it would discharge completely. I approached the customer care and the customer care took remote access and checked logs and said, I see everything healthy in device. I told even though your log shows everything right, that doesn't translate to what I physically see. I probably had conversation for almost 10-15 mins but he was always coming to point he is not seeing problem. This was my first experience with samsung phone and this will be the last. And reason is not because product was bad but the customer support is pathetic. If I get into this kind of situation with their other products as well within a week or few weeks, I would simply waste my money. I am feeling lucky that I did not buy any of their exorbitant product and learnt the lesson at lesser cost."

One of the best value for money phones,5.0,Good- got it for 9999- decent phone for this cost with all the necessary gizmos and bling- finger print sensor is good. fast and sensitive. Haven't tried the face unlock.- display is top notch on any good Samsung phone for this price- quality pics/ decent ( note - I'm a normal user of camera )- battery is very good. its really a monsterBad ( depends on perspective )- slightly big for small hands- it has all the dumb samsung apps inbuilt ( you can uninstall a few )- slightly heavier when you have a good solid case ( read as spigen branded )Overall very happy to have a good ( more than decent ) phone for the initial offer price.
Not recommended phone. Do not buy,1.0,I recieved the phone today and observed that it is lagging a lot unlike like other Samsung phones. Considering it has 6gb ram it should not be hanging at all.Camera quality is terrible.Lots of heating issuesDoes not connect to 5ghz wifiOnly replacement option available for the product and not refund. So choose the product wisely only after reviewing the feedbacks.Bad network quality. Does not catch mobile network.

Average phone with bloatware : Samsung India forces to write review,3.0,"Good phone in decent budget .Display could've been better , 90hz is not true to my usage . Since i use op7T it's clearly evident this display lacks the precision which it is said it has .Samsung India : they call me daily to inquire whether i have posted a review and what star rating should i give to the phone . This has become a headache .Dear samsung team , please do not force customer to write reviews and try to reduce the bloatware and unwanted app installations . I am starting to think MIUI was better than this .Display : not that they said / averageCamera : average / specs doesn't meetPerformance : ok for normal useBattery : good .Call quality : goodUI : Poor ,  I will not recommend samsung , this is not the one UI it was when i purchased M30S . Now this is full of bloatware and unwanted apps are getting installed by samsung store . I am puzzled on how to stop this.Overall : Very average phone . Better go for redmi note 10 or any other better phone in this price segment .Not a value for money dela"
Best Phone @12499 for 6 GB RAM/128 GB ROM Variant,5.0,"Pros:1. Best Battery i.e. 6000mAh.2. Good Back camera.3. Good and very necessary features by Samsung One UI. (I bet you'll like it)4. Good Performance (I use a lot of apps in multitasking but I don't play games so can't review gaming performance).5. Supports 15WT fast charging.6. Display is good according to the price range. (Don't get confused on poor display reviews.)7. Side positioned fingerprint sensor is good. (In starting you can face problems if you are currently using a back fingerprint sensor)8. Low light image from the back camera is also good. One attached in the image.9. Currently(11/04/21- 15/04/21) this phone is available @11700 (effective price)using Indusind bank cards so it is a loot deal for now. (Lowest ever price for this phone)Cons:1. Very bad front selfie camera which is 8MP (If you are a selfie addict then avoid it)2. Phone is very heavy and big in size.3. Adaptive brightness is not up to the mark.4.Animations are a little bit slow.5. Contact searching speed in the contacts app is very slow.(Resloved after update)6. After every update they install MX Takatak, Moz like apps which you can uninstall anytime. ( I think to make this phone that much affordable they are trying few methods of Mi and other Chinese brands.)Result: Best phone with all the latest features in this price range. @ 11700 - 12500Important(For those reviews who are saying the phone is slow): Got to developer options(Search Google for how to enable it ) and then Set Windows Animation Scale to .5x, Transition Animation Scale to .5x, Animator Duration to .5x. (Earlier all 3 developer options are set to 1x that's why the phone seems a little bit slow).Update: After update Contact searching speed became very good."
Good buy in a deal,4.0,"The storage is huge 128 gb and double microphone is a plus . However the sound quality is a disappointment. Not sure if the speaker is fault or this is what is to be expected. If you run a fan in a roome and want to watch a video or listen to an audio, you need a Bluetooth speaker for sure."
Do not  buy this phone if u want good camera,1.0,Being die hard fan of Samsung it is very difficult to write this review.Camera quality:why say 48MP  when it doesn't even look like 13MP my Mom's Samsung  M10s  camera quality and screen quality are far better than this phone. Regret for buying this phone for such high price booked on first day of launch as it came from Samsung brand. Generallyi go by reviews  but first time ordered on  launch day becoz of the reliability.I regret for the decision i made. Do not recommend the phone for anyone.
Not expected this type of thing from samsung,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Tik tik soung of plastic coming from charging jack/slot area..may be because of not sealing the phone properly or their is a gap inside. And sometimes my phone is fully charged and and charger is not attached then its showing at the bottom charged 92 % and remaining time of fully charge is showing 24 minutes."
Very very Poor network connection,1.0,"Plz do not buy this mobile.. I am facing poor network issue. In my home others are using without any interruption.. Tried many things.. Asked colleagues, neighbors, mobile store person, google and tried all the ways.. But internet is very slow.. The same sim is working fine in other devise in same location. Even internet is ON it is showing you are offline when i try something. Also took nore than 45 mins to download 72 mb size app. Atlast i cancelled and came out due to intolerance. I am placing return order, will see what is gonna happen."
Why there is no slow motion,1.0,"Don't have slow motion, and to much leg."
Average Phone,2.0,The price of the product is OK as per the price bracket. However it was nowhere compared to my old VIVO V5. Made a mistake exchanging the phone.The phone is average...
It heats up within 5min of use and then touch doesn't work,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The touch stops working after 5min of use. This phone is really pathetic. I requested for return and amazon sent technician, he came and he agreed that there was touch issue but then he has filed that there is no issue, he even asked me to send the videos on whatsapp, which i did. I feel really cheated by Amazon, then when i call the technician again, he has actually blocked my number. I saw reviews from other customers who have faced the same issue, please don't buy this phone if you don't  want to suffer like i did.  After speaking 15min with customer care they have agreed to send one more technician. I hope this time they do the right thing."
It is USB 2.0 enabled device and not MHL compatible,2.0,I bought this phone mainly for my kids online class during this pandemic. We thought to connect the mobile with our TV through HDMI adapter so that our kids can see the class directly on TV. When we tried to connect this mobile with HDMI adapter we came to know that this is not compatible with the adapter since it's USB hub is 2.0 (Don't know why Samsung configures the old USB hub for it's new mobiles). We also checked whether this mobile is MHL compatible or not? but it's not.If you are buying this mobile only for personal use then it's a good mobile. But if you are looking this mobile for your kid's online class then PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS.
Phone 📱 overall review,5.0,Very good phone. Camera display speed very good. Weight is little heavy.  But worth compare to the price
Below Average product from Samsung,1.0,"Except battery life.. rest other options like camera, display , software are all useless. If Mobile size comes under 6 or 6'4 inch then it will be preferable for elder people(above 50 age). Over all it fails in all segments. Micromax in 1 is far better than M12"
mediocre laggy device,2.0,"I bought this for my dad who is currently using M21 1st edition. Let me list down pros and consPros:1. 6000 mah battery2. Branded device. Current M21 is already running in android 12 from android 10. So future updates is not an issue. Atleast we can expect 2 major updates.3. Charger included in box (15w)Cons:1. Lag lag lag. Even the UI transition every thing is lagging like hell. I dont know how it passed QC. Basic operations like going to contacts, app view , setting everything lags like hell.2. Device feels heavy due to 6000mah battery3.  very very mediocre camera. Okaish output. I am not expecting output like iphone or samsung premium mobiles. But atleast equal to the competitors like redmi at same price range.4. They should move out of 15w charger to atleast 25w qualcomm support. Due to large battery capacity takes long time to charge device to full.5. Loading web pages with lots of images is going to be a problem. For e.g., some people have google news as default home page. For them its going to be really slow.6. Missing amoled which is thr in current m21.Verdict: If you need a branded device at 11 to 14k budget then go to this device. If not go to redmi 10s or iqoo or poco mobiles as they offer better value of money. As soon as I held the device it felt little bit heavy."
Excellent Battery  and budget,4.0,"I have been using this phone for more than a week and below is my feedback.1. Excellent battery and its lasts for 2 days at least on normal usage.2. Phone performance is good for normal usage such as YouTube,  Facebook or watsapp and usual games.3. Look and feel is good, easy to use.4. Phone is quite I feel probably due to battery  capacity.5. Front camera is not good but back one is good. This maybe great for selfie  lovers.6. Phone doesn't hang when multiple apps are opened.7. Worthy product  for this price based on spec and quality.I have attached  the photos taken and also same pic taken using both front and back camera  to show  the difference.  Overall it's a good budget Phone with all nice features and excellent battery."
Good phone 🤳📱 at reasonable price .,3.0,Initially i given 4 star and after few months of usage can see the sound quality degraded and very feeble .. camera outcome is not that much quality as they promised in d specs ..Samsung average phone at average price to meet out china companies competency..My old reviewI have bought 6GB Ram phone as I am long time user of Samsung and downgraded from high end series to this M series. D main reason u need to go for Samsung compared to China model phones is the SAR .SAR for this phone model is 1.19W/KG which is within the 1.6 range .Sound quality okayPicture quality is okay and not badBattery draining not that muchEase of navigation good 👍Performance is goodThis phone comes with backside Matt finish and not glossy finish ..tats s only cosmetic changes compared to M31 series ..Over all okay 👌🙂 ..head set won't be there which they mention in the items that they will provide..Overall decent price 👌

"Never Buy by watching the image online, very bad experience.",1.0,"1. Mobile is heavy,2. Company has given 48 Megapixel Camera, but camera quality is very poor,3. Mobile is not slim, and it is very thick mobile,4. Screen size is narrower than image5. Never buy, this mobile it is the waste of moneyAs per Amazon Policy they are not ready to return the product, I have wasted my money on this mobile."
"Positively warning, Never buy it. Terrible product. Never gonna buy samsung again.",1.0,"Edit1: adding on after using it for a few months, the call quality is terrible and microphone is also not working properly, Please look after other ones, waste of moneyThough the battery life is great, the charge time is long. Don't buy it. The performance  drop is so exaggerated. We can't switch between  apps without waiting for 3 to 4 seconds minimum.  Camera quality is bad as well.Edit 2:Worst mobile I have ever bought. Never buy it. There are lots of bugs, wifi calling gets switched off automatically, Sim signal service are irritating. Bluetooth is of inferior quality. Lte settings change automatically."
"Slowest anf dumbest phone on phone, do not buy , don't go on it's cost",1.0,"Call button speed:Worst phone speed, it take at least 10 seconds to start dial once you touch the dial button.Face detection:If you put Khichdi mixture on gas , and simultaneously try to unlock phone with face detection, I am sure khichdi will get cooked faster than your face detection.Finger scan unlock-Lock button amd finger scan button are same, and stopped working within month.Camera quality:Sony Ericsson 2Mega pixel cera of 2006 had better clarity than thia camera.Working speed:This phone is winner in speed race, if you remember the tortoise and rabbit story.Moral of the story :Worst phine by samsung"
48mo camera a dream,1.0,Very bad product.I never think such a product will come from Samsung.It had 48 MP only for show.Photos are not clear .On checking the photo size I found that 12mp again I was astonished I contacted customer care of Samsung they told me to change the camera setting 48 MP then I got photo in 48mp the clear not better than previous one .It gives very low quality photo again.It was my experience.I had bought by dreaming photo clarity.Net work problem is usually Samsung problem here .The only better thing in this phone is battery and quick charging
Disappointed..Worst mobile ever,2.0,Genuine feedback after 1 week of usageGood things:Low PriceBad things:1. Battery drains very quickly..my old realme mobile was 3000mah battery but was getting me 1 full day and this phone is 6000mah Battery but drains by evening2. I am using 4GB ram and its very very slow and very lagging..very versatile very horrible3. Finger print scanner everytime i get error message could not detect correct impression try again4. It says 48mp true camera but i could not notice any difference from my old 16mp camera5. No cancelation or refund policy6. NEVER BUY FROM AMAZON IF NO CANCEL/REFUND OPTION IS THEREConclusion:Better to chose any oppo or realme mobile in this budget
Miserable phone. Don't buy it.,1.0,"Dear friends, believe me. Don't waste your money on this phone. This is the worst phone I have ever purchased. It is slow and hangs often. The network connectivity is very poor. My Jio 4G sim, which was working perfectly on my old phone is miserably slow on this phone. For watching YouTube videos, you have to wait for minutes for the video to load. I can't believe such a miserable phone can come from Samsung. And to crown it all, there is no option for return...! You can only request for a visit by the Amazon expert. I don't believe it will do any good.After two weeks I exchanged this rubbish with a Realme phone on Flipkart. I lost around Rs. 5000 on this deal, but it is better than suffering such s miserable thing. Because of this cheating I am leaving Amazon."
Such a worst service from Amazon,1.0,"Hi Guys, dont buy this mobile. Front camera is too bad although it has 8mp. Main camera has 48 mp. But still there is no night mode, continuous shots panorama options. I used to have all these options in my earlier samsung mobile which is a 3 years back model. Mobile gets heated very easily although I just use it for calls and little browsing . Display is not amoled so dont expect much quality here.Phone is too heavy to keep in pocket also. And finally amazon is not replacing phone although we complaint on the first day of receiving it, they simply arrange a technician visit in the last 7 days they arranged visit for 3 times . But no technician visits simply they call from Gujarat when mayne is Hyderabad and simply say we will replace mobile but to amazon they say everything is fine and close the ticket. So finally understand that these technicians are nothing but amazon employees only and Amazon I'd dragging till the replacement deadline ends . They never gonna replace mobile also leave about return.And finally this is my first mobile bought in Amazon. Till now I used to buy in Flipkart. I never had any issue with Flipkart. I decided not buy any electronics in amazon from now onwards. Finally I felt I wasted around 9k on this shit model from Samsung and buying in the great indian bluffing sale of amazon. Thanks to Amazon and Samsung for your wonderful committment to customer. You keep loosing for sure many customers during to ur bluffing stuff."
Worst Samsung for me.,1.0,Had some expectations. Worst mobile experience. I might be happy if I have bought this phone 4 years back. Such a bad touch screen slogging performance. Nothing is good in this
Did Not Meet Basic Expectation,3.0,"The phone doesn't meet the basic expectations from at a 10k budget segment and I was surprised to find that the MRP is INR 15499. The camera is a false 48MP and not at all true and the sensor has a very poor performance. There is no support for 5Ghz Wi-Fi which is strange to find at this age of mankind. The speed and performance of this octa core processor is sloppy.The only thing good about this phone is the battery backup and the storage provided in the higher configuration. If you are buying this phone for a standby purpose, then it is fine and worth the money. If you are considering to buy this as a primary phone, take deep breaths and look further for better options in the same budget segment.Always check the manufacturer website for specification details before buying the product."
Worst product from Samsung,2.0,"I bought this phone for reputed brand, 128GB memory, 6 GB RAM.But my bad nothing is working :- It buffers every 5 seconds in each and every audio, video including downloaded videos/audios.- Does not have 5GHz wifi singal acceptance. It shows only 12 Mbps for a 200Mbps fiber comnection for 2.4GHz wifi signal.- Mobile voice network is always low. Voice break always happens, where as all my other mobile works fone.- All applications are very slow and crashes. (Faulty software even after updates).- Sound system including ring tone is very low.- Hotspot goes off multiple times without any reason.- Battery backup 12-14 hours and takes too long to charge- No support from Samsung (Closed 3 tickets without responding)Please don't buy, you will waste yor money."
Not compatible with 5 GHz wifi,1.0,This phone is not compatible with 5 GHz wifi. I have JioFiber which is having 142 Mbps speed but my wifi network is not visible in phone's WIFI.I called to Samsung customer care and he informed that this phone will be connected to wifi which is having 2.5 GHz.I am returning back this product.
Record sale good price good specs...,4.0,I have Mo2s and this m12....better buy m12 you get better storage ram camera and finger scanner etc....record selling on Amazon...just checking performance...will give review after 1 month....overall good on specs....
Samsung phone are worst quality,1.0,Very worst phone. Just waste of money and time. I did not any support from Samsung team and Amazon. The battery and charger getting heated up. When I call Samsung customer service they said as you have purchased from Amazon they will not support. Amazon team say that as this a Samsung phone you can call them. They are playing games and I was completely cheated by them. If you purchase from Amazon Samsung team no warranty for this product is only 7 days from the day of purchase.So be careful before you purchase the electronic from Amazon you can get cheated them.I have paid RS 11000 towards this phone.
does not work with 5GHz wifi,1.0,Don't get duped by this phone. The description of the phone does not describe wifi support anywhere. Who makes a phone without 5GHz support in the year 2021!!! Apparently Samsung does. This pathetic piece of plastic does not support for 5GHz wifi.
Worst service provided by Amazon Don't buy this.,1.0,"Please , Don't buy this product ""samsung galaxy M13"" specially from Amazon.This product I have purchased from Amazon, I faced the problem  .....The mobile is being hanged continuously and after inserting the sim the network is not showing........This problem I have discussed with customer care and first of all I wanted to return this product and I wanted to take my refund back but the thing is what they started a process like to send the technician to delivery address and after that the technician called that and we told him to visit our address and he forced not to come on delivery address. According to technician he said he will resolved the issue on call.....one application we installed that he want for testing purpose after that he sent screen-shot on my personal mobile number in that he had selected hardware issue and said that now you can return the product. But the main thing is I am unable to return this because there is no option available for this ...I tried to call the technician again, he is not recieving my call....so called customer care again....... we talked with customer care and what they said we will send the technician again...but we want our refund back but they forced me to send the technician again and repeat the process again.....But why should I do this process again this is not our fault.....I want my refund back.This product I had purchased for my mother and I have faced this problem.I request you all please don't buy this mobile or any mobile from Amazon... You can all face the same problem as we have faced....In logo paiso ki koi kadar nahi he. Ek person mehnat krk paisa kamata he or ye logo haram ki khane ki padi he.Kl se inke kisi family member ko gift de rahe he or problem ho ink sath bhi....tb inko pta padega.Meri batdua he in sbko ink sath isse bhi worst hona chahiye.....inka paisa or kisi chiz me nikalna chahiye.IF YOU WANT TO THIS PRODUCT OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT I RECOMMEND TO GO TO  THE GOOD MOBILE SHOP AND PURCHASE IT.....DON'T PUT YOURSELF IN THIS TRAP.Thank you"

Worst phone ever seen from Samsung,1.0,"This is a sincere review after using this crazy Samsung mobile for more than a month. THIS THE WORST MODEL EVER RELEASED BY SAMSUNG AND MARKETTED BY AMAZON. The mobile does not charge properly and I raised a complaint on the same with Amazon on the 3rd day of my purchase. They said a technician will checkbit. The tech did check and co firmed this could get replaced, however there was no bledy action from Amazon. The charging problem slowly got rectified without anything done with it. Later since yesterday I see the same problem again. I don't a reason  why I shut bled spend 11k on such a crazy phone. I lost all the impression I had on Amazon with this purchase. DO NOT BUYTHIS MODEL AT ALL.On top of it this phone is very heavy in weight and circastically  can be used for self defense as a weapon.The retina scan is very very pathetic.....My older phone which is Realme 2 is far more better when it comes to device weight and the retina scan."
This isnt a smartphone with very good features,3.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The mobile looks amazing .The drawback is that the phone is huge and also heavy.Talking of camera clarity its average quality .The speakers are also not great .So overall thats a very average mobile ,but with the price it’s absolutely worth it !!"
wifi doesn't support 5ghz WIFI band,2.0,"Very disappointed, single band wifi doesn't support 5ghz WIFI band. My 5years old Lenovo k4 note mobile able to connect 5g wifi.  Future is 5g. But this mobile not even supports to connect 5g wifi network"
"Sir, I am really sorry however, M12 supports only 802.11 b/g/n 2.4GHz.",2.0,"""Sir, I am really sorry however, M12 supports 802.11 b/g/n 2.4GHz.""- This is the response from Samsung customer service when I inquired why not able to detect to my Router 5G. Even 6K Chinese mobiles have 5G detection - so before you buy think and check as the mobile has very limited features. The battery life is not great while it is 6000.... and camera is very normal standard. The mobile as a whole is a big compromise to the cost and is not a value for money product."
"processor,  battery are ok , Fingerprint sensor,camera and UI not good",3.0,"After a long span of time say 3 years, im back to Samsung. Now, Samsung realise that selling their name is no more working and reduce the price at the level of other company to success in the market . I bought 6 gb one and very happy with it now.However,  as before, many of the inbuild apps irritating me which are not uninstallable.After using it for 3 months plus, let me give my fair opinion:1. Battery life makes me happy, but fast charging needs 2 hrs plus is little bit annoying.2. Camera must not be more than 12 Megapixel. As compared to my previous phone MI Note 6 pro, I dont see any better snap here.3. Finger print sensor is absolutely annoying. Most time i have to enter my password manually as FP sensor do not detect my fingerprint. How my previous phone MI Note 6 pro nicely detects my fingerprint and easily open phone has been missing here.4. As MAH is more, thr weight of phone is bit heavy. I dont know why Silicon cover of around Rs 99 approx cannot be attached here in the package!! I bought silicon cover from Amazon but lately arrived which cause my phone screeen crack due to fallen from my bed. If it was in Silicon cover, the Lcd must have been intact till now. MI 6 Pro had come with one extra phone safety cover but Samsung cannot.5. After two years , I come to Samsung again hoping much UI improvement. However, i found Samsung do not compete with even MI in certain ways. I need to put Alarm clock on, i can easily go directly to all clock setting by clicking wall paper clock in MI while this phone need me to go to the clock in menu and so. When a turn on torch, i can easily turn it off by pressing power button in MI while this phone needs me to open screen and tap on torch icon in menu manuallyAs off now, i can point out these points to ascertain my judgement. I will comeback after using a year if get time"
Nice product,5.0,"Actually i brought this phone on focus to the 6 gb ram, 128 gb storage, 48 mp camera & 6000ah battery. Later on viewing the review of some customer i  was very upset & regreting myself. But when i received the item and my experience on the phone is 100% satisfy with the product. Awesome phone on this price range.Thank amazon & its seller partners, once more thank for courier partner too which help to delivery my item on time & safty.  Thank all"
Payment issue,1.0,Product is okayBut I cancelled order to get discount by paying for the same product by credit card.Disappointed that it was rejected.
Samsung m12 better backup experience it's excellent,5.0,"I'm writing this review after using few days I must say samsung m12 is great phone  in  budget segment  compared to vivid v17 and realme 6pro that I'm already using  samsung m12 better backup  is excellent after 12hr using only 30% 0f better  used but I'm requesting  samsung  to do some important on all cameras  in next update  actually need some improvement  but  I must say in Rs.10999/  this the best samsung m12 phone if anyone thinking to buy samsung m12 please go for it ...but befor that few things I'm not happy with phone is1) network connectivity need updated as soon as possible2) Amazon, Amazon prime, flipkart and eew more apps not working bugs is their.3) YouTube also buffering after connected 6mbps speed network4) In the software I think lost of bugs are their need updat as soon as possible. from my side I like it very much thanks samsung for this budget phone  thanks Amazon for one day delivered"
Not worth the money spent.,1.0,"I bought Samsung Galaxy M12. Initially, the mobile worked good but for the past 3-4 days the mobile is geting heats up even without using and while charging it hets heats up.Since this mobile carried 1 year warranty for manufacturing device and 6 months warranty for in-box accesories including battery.I request Amazon or Samsung(manifacturer) to replace the said mobile at the earliest."
Good purchase!,5.0,"Although i ordered this mobile for my dad. He uses it and i can't give my reviews.But i did setup the mobile app in the beginning and he is using it happily.One thing stands out here is that its 6000mAH battery, that means 8 hours of standby time.I would love to own a mobile with 6000-8000 mAh battery.And there is no easy way of replacing the battery, once it has reached its age.So its a good purchase, really good battery life. Good."
Performance & price,5.0,In dis price u can afford M12 ...no doubt...overall excellent performance
Worth for Money,4.0,"Good and worthy for the money, camera is not that much better, other features are good but too much advertisements in the phone which iritates users. Some mandatory features from Samsung which can't be disabled permanently."
"Good Features, okayish Phone",4.0,"I gave it 4 Stars for the features that do work and not because it's a great phone. Considering price I paid for It I am reviewing it.Pros: Good Battery Life, Great Fingerprint sensor placement, Speakers are good as well for the price, Widevine L1 support with Dolby Atmos too. Storage is plenty with Expandability. Form factor I found good Too.Cons: Performance; sometimes it lags and the 90hzs is a gimmick, the UI itself is too laggy to notice it's smoothness. They went wrong in cameras too, just because they can afford to put a 48 megapixel camera doesn't mean it's good. The ISP is bad and makes even the bayered photos look noisy. I would suggest to use a GCam mod, then again I didn't find one that works perfectly for Exynos 850. Also other 3 cameras are just as bad if not worse. Shooting raw helps if you have the time to edit it later on Lightroom or snapseed.Also Noticed that the software adds background blur that looks unnatural, at f2.0 this should not happen at all.Get it for you parents."
"Good phone for a great price. Not a snapdragon chip, but that is not an issue.",4.0,"Amazon did a great job with the delivery of this product. Ordered and received on the same day.On the phone: I am happy with it. Have been using this phone for 3 days. The battery lasts for 1and half days with gaming and binge watching videos.The screen is comfortable. No issues on the screen, though  it is not amoled for an average user it is not a big difference.For the price this is a great buy, of course there is no snapdragon chip. But the exynos 850 is 8nm and at this price point is comparable to most snapdragon 6series chipsets.Camera is decent. As long as you are not a professional photographer,  this will be good enough to take atleast average if not great pics. (Some  pics are really great).This is definitely not an iPhone or one plus. But for the price it definitely is great."
Great mid range Phone !!,5.0,"This phone is amazing for the price. Phone runs smooth considering it's a Exynos 850 Octa core processor. I like the 90Hz screen and I keep it ON all the time.  The fingerprint recognition is extremely fast and reliable. It has a decent camera, the battery is long lasting. The only deal breaker is that it doesn't support 5GHz Wi-Fi. Android 11 with One UI 3.1 is clean and very responsive and runs smooth without stutter or lag. One can avoid ads and bloatware if you setup the device carefully. I haven't seen a single ad on my device and I have been using it for almost 3 weeks.It's the best budget phone for the features you get. Doesn't look or feel cheap."
About Samsung M12,4.0,"Mobile looks good, battery is good,Camera better,Not good for gaming continue usage of gaming get heating issue.Normal usage of mobile is awesome"
Overall good product..,4.0,"Pros :6 gb ram128 gb storagePlus 48 mp back cameraHuge 6000mah batteryLooks are pretty good as wellFingerprint sensor is on the sideCons :Front camera is horribleScreen is not upto the markDue 6k mah battery it is little bit heavyOnly 15 watt chargerNo slow mo or other features in cameraConclusion:If you use it for general use, storage, binge watching it is a great phone but if u are gamer, photo addict, looks then it's not worth it.Although great phone by Samsung in this price range."
Highly disappointed,1.0,"I got this M12 (4 / 64 gb and 6000 battery) as an upgrade to the M01 Core (1 / 16 gb and 3000 battery) phone, in the hope that it would be better ... BUT:1.  battery despite being double the size does not last any longer ..... 50-60% after only1 day of light use (I dont do any social stuff, only 3-5 talks and 1-3 messages per day);2. the ringtone and message notification choice is very poor .... had to import from the old phone;3. could not download ringtones directly to phone, but this may well be more of a problem related with Google;4. software is not friendly, even after 1 full day of struggle, have not been able to locate / access storage card;5. was very happy with the 1 / 16 gb in my earlier phone and never had memory usage beyond about 60%, but this guy eats up more than 2 gb out of the 4 gb RAM even to start with even after i have uninstalled most of the ""apps"";6. one of the reasons of purchasing this was for its USB teethering, which works fine.Bring back the good old button phones (with proper software as 15 years back, and with some improvement in screen / pixels) and get rid of the bloatware.Think."
Awsome phone with brick size.,3.0,"Recently I bought this galaxym12 for Rs.11k. Overall ok. But onething have to remember thst is thickness of the phone. Its 10mm THICK. Just like a brick in your pocket. Overall dimension of the phone also big. Hight , width, especialy thickness. Before i bought i didn't noticed the sizes of the this piece. Thats my mistake too. But u guys please concern about this review before you buy. Otherthan size completly ok at this price."
Good Budget phone,5.0,"I gifted my mom this phone in November 2021 and got a better discount for 64GB. Overall it is good, even i feel the size is big but its not that broad while holding it in your hands. Screen quality is good, Camera performs really well in daylight, in low light it suffers a bit and pictures are not that clear and color is also not that accurate. Battery is very good, it goes for more than a day and half (As usage is off-course not that much) but considering the price i believe this is a good choice, Samsung has some bloat ware which you can avoid by unchecking the boxes while setting up at the first time, or delete the apps after your first setup. Rest no major complaints, charger is not turbo charge but it does it work as expected. Thx"
Budgetary Phone for Frequent Callers,3.0,"Look, feel and finish of the phone is good and up to the standards of Samsung. I am a frequent traveller and caller so was looking for a budgetary phone which has most of the features along with good battery backup. This meets my requirement.Pros:- Fit and finish is very good- Good battery backup- Performance is good with fast response- Storage and ram is sufficient as I opted for 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage variant- Responsive finger printing sensor- Loud and clear sound with and without speaker for calls- Clear voice callingCons:- Heavy weight makes it difficult to hold and use- The screen is HD only. Not even FHD but supports 1080 p video viewing- 4 K videos will never play in 4 K mode. Only can be played in 1080 p resolution- No gyroscope and magnetometer sensor which means, compass application and some games which use these sensors will never work- No Corning Gorilla class. Screen is prone to scratches without cover- Sound is below average for music listeners- Double tap doesn’t work to wake up the screenConclusion:Only go for this if you are using for phone calls with good battery backup. Not worth for entertainment purpose. I can still survive on this as I have an iPad for entertainment. Samsung is marketing it in such a way where none of the sensors specifications and entertainment features are mentioned clearly on the website as it is not having any of them. It’s a true calling phone !"

Worst camera phone ever and worst customer support from Amazon,1.0,Most third class camera quality . I had phone in my young days which was 5 megapixel it clicked better photos than this 50 megapixel camera . Samsung as well as Amazon is just fooling people by their publicity . I will request everyone never ever think off this phone absolute waste of money . And amazon is not taking care of customers grievance . Amazon has become one of the most  thirdclass in customer satisfaction  50 megapixel shoots photos like 5 megapixel or even lower quality.phone heats up during charging. Never buy product from Amazon I requsted for a return but amazon denied it. I am never going tobuy anything from Amazon in future .
Good for general use,4.0,"Bought this for my Dad. Its good enough for general use.Pros:1. Performance : Its fast enough for general use. Did not notice much lag in UI.2. Features : Has more features than my Samsung F41, like camera macro mode.3. Battery : Lasts long.4. Weight : Has some weight but it doesn't feels so when in hand.Cons:1. Software : Somewhat buggy. The keypads in Upi app doesn't show up completely.2. Camera : Average quality. Indoor photos have noise. Also, its takes a bit time to process the image after capture.Overall, its good budget phone for general use and not for extensive use.Recommended!"
Good phone but front camera is not upto the mark.,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Phone is good at this price. Battery life is long. It will lasts upto 2 days if you are doing simple tasks on it.Processor is good.But one thing here is to mention that, if you are looking for good camera quality phone this is not it. Its front camera is not good. Picture quality ruining when you zoom in. So Overall good phone 🖖 except camera 📷"
Average Phone,3.0,Cons-Camera is average.Display dosent feel as smooth as 90 hertz it feels just like normal display.Battery life is ok but not as per 6000 mah only last 1.5 days with moderate usage.Also samsung does not provide any back cover with this mobile so if u buy this mobile do purchase a backcover.Pros-Customisation of samsung is good...lot of themes to change the look of your mobile screen.Buit quality is ok.Sound quality is good.Fingerprint reader is fast.Don't trust Youtubers who are just marketing this mobile for sake of money....These people are biggest frauds.
Good for this price range except no dual band wifi support,3.0,"Camera picture quality not up to the par! But considering the price range, it is acceptable!But no 5GHz band support! Unacceptable in 2021!!90Hz screen refresh rate does not feel like 90Hz!Lot of lag is present! Don't know if that is a software bug!Battery performance is good!!Speakers are good, as expected.Overall, except the WiFi dual band support issue, rest is acceptable in this price range!!"
Slow loading of all apps and poor response even for making calls,2.0,"Received my M13 4G phone yesterday. This is 6 GB RAM/128GB phone but is so much slower than my previous Redmi Note 7 which is only 3GB RAM /64GB phone. I use only social media and calls. I don't use any games etc and uninstalled all unwated apps and games.  I am very dissatisfied of the long time taking to load even the Amazon app or time taken to  making a call. And the worst part is you cannot return it as they have only replacement policy. Redmi Note 11 is a far better, faster and lighter phone at the same price range"
Value for money....,5.0,"Superb..... Great speed.... and photos clarity. Loving ...... Battery last 100% charge, using since 2 days... Yet at 23% . Banking , payment security 👍. Camera 😘🥳, Speed ❤️❤️, All quality of phone , as name Samsung is Enough 👍❤️❤️❤️. Brand is Brand. Price range 👍🥰🥰. Finger print sensor 💪🏃⛷️⛷️⛷️superb. I will rate phone for this price range 95. As only 2 colour options available."
Sheer Jank + Maniplative Refund Policy,1.0,"Don't buy. I have no idea why this product has so many positive reviews, but it scares me to think that so many people may actually find this phone an improvement over their previous devices. What have y'all been using?The camera lags worse than a VGA. Camera quality is OK at best, but the stutter! Omg the stutter! Especially the front cam! It's worse than nearly all of the phones I've used in the past decade or so. Absolutely nacceptable in a phone released in 2021.Right out of the box, everything lags. Want to open your contact list? Lag. Your message box? Lag. Playstore? Lag. Camera? You know it. Lag. Swipe left, Lag. Swipe right, Lag. Unbelievable!And then there's the return policy. Which is to say, there is no return policy. If your product arrives damaged, they'll send you another one. But if you're unsatisfied with the level of jank this phone has to offer (like I don't know, maybe you wanted a phone that doesn't go through F1 racing levels of motion blur if your pupils so much as dilate), you're told we don't take back our clearly terrible product. You're stuck with it until you can find a decent phone, accept that you have to take a loss of over 50%, and exchange this thing for a much better phone. Samsung, what were you guys on when you cooked this up? It's bad enough to make me swear off your products indefinitely and find more honest purveyors."
"Good for average usage; no wifi calling, speaker volume very low",2.0,"Good phone for average daily use. I am slightly disappointed as wifi calling feature is missing. My old M30 had wifi calling two years ago. Also, the call volume is very low, I have to press against my ear to listen to calls."
Not as expected,2.0,"Samsung is cheating people with marketing big numbers for a product. All the specifications are just on paper.In reality, every specification is just sub-par.Camera quality is same as what you see in phones that released in 2012-2013, like Galaxy Grand 2.Battery is advertised as 6000mAh, but in actual, it gives the same result as a 3000mAh battery.Processor is just utter crap.Seeing a phone for the first where the initial setup itself lags like anything.Display quality feels same as resistive touch era phones.Screen shows bleeding symptoms.I wish they had a return policy instead of replacement."
Best Budget phone in last few years and it’s so smooth,4.0,"No need to underestimate exynos 850, with 90Hz refresh rate.it’s not disappointed me. I bought it as second phone(I use iPhone SE 2020).With normal use more then 48hrs still 44% battery leftFingerprint sensor is unbelievable it’s so quickCamera is decent enough to capture picturesDisplay Quality is GoodOverall I felt good for buying it for 9999/- with ICICI credit card offer.It’s worth buying, it’s far better than other MI with same price (10999-12999 in 4GB -64GB ) as Samsung don’t irritate with adds and also more secured"
Good phone at budget!!!,5.0,"Samsung M12 has a good battery life, average charging speed with type c and moderate camera quality. Side mounted fingerprint scanner is fast and responsive.While setting up for first time do not accept optional terms and conditions, otherwise it will show ads and load unnecessary apps, watch YouTube videos on how to disable ads and stop apps from installing. A good backup smartphone if you already have costly smartphone."
Do not buy this Adware phone!,1.0,"This phone comes with a ton of garbage Apps pre Installed. Samsung appears to be partner with IronSource which is a mobile app advertising company and they will keep bugging you to install tons of non sense apps. Over 10 apps were installed on my phone without my permission or without me asking or agreeing to anything. I did not expect this from Samsung phones, I know this is the case with most chinese phones such as Xiaomi but figures even Samsung comes with such Adwares. I wouldn't have bought this phone if I knew it was an Adware phone. You have been warned."
Monester battery back up and great product from Samsung,5.0,"I had procured this phone for my Dad, who had a 5 year old Motorola G5Plus phone. He was adamant that he dont want to replace the phone, as he got so used to the old phone user interface. Thanks to Samsung's better user interface, he was able to adapt to an easier to use phone. Let me get to the advantages and disadvantagesAdvantages1) Ease to use Samsung interface that is self intuitive for senior citizens. I was a bit apprehensive but Dad himself said it is easy to use2) Monester battery back up, one of the reason for shifting from the old phone is that the battery backup offered from a 3500mah battery v/s 6000mah batteryDisadvantages1) It has only a 2.4Ghz wifi connectivity, which is really bad. However for my Dad, he just uses the phone for Whatsapp and basic purpose and the incremental 5Ghz band wifi would have been good. The earlier phone had it.Thanks to Amazon for shipping the product express fast to a tier 3 city and delighting my Dad i.e. ordered placed on Sunday early morning and phone was received by Monday morning... super fast. The associate who done the exchange was patient as well (Dad did not allow me to remove the SIM and the SD card until the new phone arrived). Had to go through the Amazon device validation etc.  Highly recommended."
Worthy product 10k,4.0,"Purchased and used for almost +3 months.Overall review is good. It's a best phone if you purchased below Rs11,000. I purchased on Rs10499Pros-Camera 4/5Battery 4.5/5UI 4/5Cons-In-Hand experience 3.5/5"
Por quality of parts and an overall disappointment,1.0,"The build feels flimsy and cheap, I got one with a bent display. Unfortunately I never realised this defect until I went to pick up a back case and it wouldn't fit.Back at the Samsung service centre they said it isn't covered under warranty, and I should've returned it at the time of delivery.Camera is nowhere close up 48MP as claimed, pictures clicked with it are mediocre, to say the least.The only saving grace is the decent battery life.It's a good phone to stay away from though"
Good device with some major issues.,4.0,"This phone is mostly suited for multimedia, video, internet, office work.Pros-1. Good battery, 2. Connectivity, 3. Knox Security, 3. Design, 4. Price(because samsung mobiles are costlier), 5. Camera, 6. Durability, 7. Side mounted fingerprint, 8. Quick finger print reading, 9. Display (although it's a tft panel but picture quality is quite impressive), 10. Type c, 11. Fast charge, 12. Ui.Cons-1. Heavy weight, 2. Quiet thicker, 3. Processor (heating issue, sometimes heats up without any reason maybe because of background process), 4. Ui lags, could be more optimized, 5. Display (samsung could have given atleast ips panel), 6. Charger(15w charger is not sufficient for a 6000mah battery) 7. Because of ui and processor the battery service becomes very bad which could be good although."

 🤡Good camera, 🔴Nice Build Quality and Excellent Ram Management. 👀Performance of 6000🔋 Mah Battery Life For 2 Days Enough With Single Charge. Its Really Monster. 🗑️Overall It is Perfect 📱Smartphone for Every One. Finger Print Senser and Face Lock is Very Fast. 👍🔴Excellent work by samsung in 2021.🎱"
RAM PLUS FEATURE NOT WORKING,1.0,"Im not able to expand the Ram memory using Ram Plus feature...as promised in the phone description by Samsung.Only 2 options are present in Ram plus: 2GB and 4GB. In website it is clearly mentioned, that the phones Ram can be extended to 8GB. Dint expect this type of FRAUD from Samsung"
Good phone but could have been better. Rating 4 stars,4.0,"Although the overall experience is good but few basic things missing:1. You can't take screen shots by swiping on screen. You have to juggle with volume and start button which is not user friendly.2. You don't have option of ""always on display "" to just tap the screen and see time.Good things:1. Back cover is good. Specially the blue one.2. Light weight and sleek.3. No lag while playing games.To summarize, it's a value for money."
"Good value for money - (12/12/21) - Samsung Galaxy M12 (Blue,6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - .",4.0,"16/12/21Re-review, after one week of usage, ( learning the product better). I recall my review on12/12/21.Good value for money.  After learning the product and it's  features, I find my choice is worth.I have no idea how the picture quality is coming different & good to first few pictures.I am happy with my purchase.Thanks.__________12/12/21 - not the value for money - Samsung Galaxy M12 (Blue,6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)Review is based on first three days use.Reason for this purchase - switching from MotoXForce, due to irreplaceable exhausted battery & incresed ROM need.Rating for Amazon as market place - 4/5. (good display of available options, window shopping, product information, product comparison, communication)Rating for product - Samsung Galaxy M12 (Blue,6GB RAM, 128GB Storage):One star out of Five - Utter poor camera quality - 48MP quad cam image quality is damn inferior than my previous 24MP MotoXforce image. So unimaginable from Samsung. I find Galaxy S3 images are so fine quality.Battery charging not as fast, as the listing claims.Battery life (6000mAh) - not in tune with expectation, ehausts sooner.Fingerprint reader -  not always recognising. (perhaps the narrow finger print sensor limitation)This is disappointing.I encourage you go for a better option than M12.Thanks."
Worth the price!,5.0,"1. All calls can be automatically recorded without announcement to the other person.2. Images, videos from dual WhatsApp also can be downloaded on laptop.3. Battery lasts very long.4. Phone cleaner app (like Redmi) is not available. It is essential.5. Network speed (like Redmi) is not available. It is essential.6. Fingerprint reader is ok type.7. Overall value for money, as I hardly play games on mobile."
Great phone ...great value,5.0,"You won't regret buying this phone, unmatched quality. Quality of calls, screen and sound is superb. No annoying pop ups or apps. Safe and secure for banking and transections, no spying or peaky apps pre-installed.  Unlike other, no fake marketing or unessassry promotion of featuresThis is a great phone, looks premium, offers more then value, and very promising.  don't even consider other phones, specifically Chinese brands."
Overall Basic Phone by Samsung,5.0,"Its like a pure Samsung stock Android phoneEverything is customisable ,its easy to use no lags or glitchesGames run smoothly COD , Asphalt 9 etcCall Quality is goodThere is no wifi 6 feature ( not everyone has wifi 6 at home yet)Overall a great simple phone must buy!!!! Just Rs 10,000/-"
Worth buying product from Samsung,5.0,"Apart from all the negative reviews, still I bought Samsung M13 . Everything is perfect in this price segment. There is no doubt  when it comes Samsung and Apple.Good mobile in this price rangeTrust worthy sellerAmazon service is always bestGenuine seller with genuine productBattery life is goodOverall worth buying the mobile."
PERFECT FOR DAILY NORMAL USE,5.0,"I am writing this review after 5 month usageI own the version with 4gb ramI use for daily normal work(internet email whatsapp music twitter etc).  it runs totally fine , no hassle. also battery life is good, it is enough to run 24 hours after 1 full charge.I like the user interface as there is minimum pre installed app, also samsung now allows to remove pre-installed apps, thus making the phone faster.so for normal daily usage, just go for it without a second thought. it is a perfect budget phone."
Faulty device,1.0,"The phone delivered had issues with connectivity.The mobile network would abruptly go out of reach and you can then not send, receive calls or use mobile data. This started happening after 2 days of light usage. ( I still had my old phone intact).Amazon customer care support was even worse. They imposed having an engineer visit to diagnosis the phone and that never happened. Someone just connected with me over phone and told me to install some app and then run some tests of touch, sound, etc. I mean I never complained about the touch and audio.The issue was with the network connectivity...Later they said that they had no way to check the connectivity issue of the phone and hence marking the phone as  ""Ok"". Now I am being offered a replacement. But I don't trust this model anymore and I am being denied the refund. What a mess !The other cons with this model:1. Very heavy2. The display is very very dull3. Have lagging issues (it's still just 4-5 days old)Update:Amazon customer care acknowledged the device fault and have initiated the refund process."
Good for the price but unwanted apps installed without permissions,5.0,"I got it for 8999 with bank discount, very good phone for the price. Battery is awesome,it lasts for 9 hour continuous video Play and 1.5 day nirmal use.15W charger charges fast.Fingerprint on side is fast and it's easy to unlock then phone on table. Other phones have fingerprint at back side which is useless.Camera quality isnt that good but it's okay.Only problem is Samsung installs unwanted apps without permission. It installed the paisabazaar app without my permission. The ""paisabazaar"" and ""policybazaar"" are the biggest scammers in India."
Already opened or used,2.0,"So far I ve no issues regarding the producr quality and delivery,it was gud...further comenting after using the product for a week or so...but as revealed above in the pictures,I think I ve got a used or already opened product,I mean whenever I ve bought the product from the store,I ve got it well packed and sealed(in a transparent plastic cover)but here....it is without any covering or seal.Thats why our family never likes to buy such stuff from amazon....flipkart is best for electronic items and gazettes"
Good one with powerful battery,4.0,"Good one. Serves the purpose. Good phone in budget. Powerful longlasting battery. A bit bulky and a bit slower (compared to higher mid range phones) considering 6GB RAM but you can turn off the animations (by activating developer mode) to make it faster. Still very few apps r a bit slower but that is quite acceptable as it doesn't irritate. Getting 6GB RAM for INR 11500 is awesome. It is not that slow also. Camera is good but shutter speed is slower. Hence, u need to be very steady while clicking pictures in low light else they turn out to be shaky. Nonetheless, a very descent camera in this range. Very difficult to get 6GB RAM Samsung in just 11500. Overall happy about this purchase. Good if u want a phone around 10K. Much better than simply spending 20-30K for few added features. Good if u want a secondary phone for office use (checking emails, etc.). Good for kids online classes. Sturdy enough. If u want non Chinese phone and r getting 6GB RAM in 11500 nothing like it. Just go for it. No regrets. Loving this phone."
Good budget phone,4.0,"I got it delivered yesterday. So these are my first impressions after initial setupSize:This is a huge phone. So if you have small hands this phone cannot be used single handed. If you need to use it single handed often, better go for a grippy case with a string or a ring case so it doesn't fall out. Or go for a small phoneSpeed:It is a bit slow, but you can get used to it. For the price range, it seems to have a decent performance.Audio:This phone is advertised as supporting Dolby Atmos but that's only for bluetooth or other audio devices. Not for the phone speaker. Which is kind of a shame. But the audio is not bad.Video/Screen:Blacks are not exactly black. But again, for this price you shouldn't notice those things.Colors are bright***The phone is country locked. So to activate any other country sim you must first use an Indian sim for 5 mins cumulatively.I have not tested the other features like camera, fingerprint sensor etc. Will update as soon as I do"
"I have face the problem with audio after 10 days used,",1.0,"The cellphone is good built quality,there id some problem in camera quality and the finger sensor,Most biggest problem that ihave faced in decice in 10 days th calling quality and the audio its not working well,Ex- Your device volume setup in 1 to 10 ,1 is lower and 10 means higher, i have set on 10 but volume listing like 4-5 the same problem in calling if we are on call the same issue i m facing with device."
Privacy Concern,1.0,"The phone is preinstalled with some useless annoying apps which collect personal data and no guarantee that these collected data will not be misused. Some apps, you can not delete like Samsung Pay Mini, Samsung Free and Galaxy Store etc. I think, customer must have right to delete or uninstall as per its own wish without rooted the phone and these type of forceful use of app is not justified. After all, customer is paying full payment for the phone and not for the annoying useless apps which collect personal data even without consent."
"Very nice phone, great value.",5.0,"I am Samsung user for longest time and despite some negetive reviews, I say best value for money. Only downside are its heavy, but you get use to it and the screen quality. Yes, side by side my other Samsung its a let down, but of its own it's absolutely fine. So, if high quality OLED is must for you then get the one of the other models.Rest no hang issues, does not heat, brilliant battery (as a backup phone on extreme power saver mode it lasted over 5 days!)."
"Don't Buy, No Exchange",1.0,This phone is not listed on Exchange models while buying a new phone which means Samsung has delisted its own product. That's how Junk this product is for Samsung. Amazon says exchange is listed by seller. We buy from Amazon and not Samsung. Add some more money and buy better products then electronic junks on Sale especially Mobile Phones.Sale period defective and faulty units are rolled out otherwise a new product cannot have problems within a month. There are only 2 buttons in a smart phone and that also most important one goes bad or was missing parts. You will waste money even in warranty - they charge pickup drop as travelling 10kms during covid and wasting half day in queue is a disaster.That's why Samsung sales suffer in Mobile phone markets------------------------------------------within 20 days the fingerprint scanner button stops working. initially looked good. it seems they are reselling used phones which can work until return window is closed. Amazon has zero liability post return window and they dumped junk
Worst product from samsung and worst services from amazon,1.0,"Do not purchase this phone. This is the worst product from Samsung. I have been trying for a replacment and amazon is simply wasting my time by sending different technicians. Their technicians are fruad too. They detect the issue in front of you and mark issue as resolved in their app. I never expected this sort of services from a brand like amazon.Coming to the issues with mobile, my major dissapointment is with the camera quality. The pixel quality is poorer than ever. Phone doesnt connect to 5hz internet frequency. Amazon should look into this seriously and priortize their customer needs"
Defective Product,1.0,It's very bad that the sound in my phone is not working in just less than 1 month of purchase. We have warranty and Samsung may rectify the issue but who is responsible for the trouble we faced for two or three days. Samsung slowly going down and they can lose market share if they do not take an action on sellers who are selling defective pieces. 1 is the highest score that I can give but this phone is deserved for 0 or less.
Battery life is Good But not the camera,4.0,"I gifted this smartphone to my Dad. He doesn't use smartphone that much so i was focused on large battery backup category. I found this smartphone and the reviews is very bad about camera and speed.Definitely this isn't the phone if you're looking for gaming or making videos on it. You have to pay more for that but this is good smartphone for parents or children's for study.I didn't like the camera and it doesn't support 5Ghz band in wifi and it also doesn't support Full HD videos because of HD Display.Colors are good and overall my dad is satisfied with the performance. So, if you're thinking about to gift this phone to your parents the you are good to go but if you're buying for yourself and you can expand your budget then go for Better processor and storage type."
Just Go For It!,5.0,"( I have the 6GB/128GB variant and this User Review is on this model ) If you are a NORMAL User like me....who does not play any Games or doesn't use the phone camera much......and just use it to phone call, binge some movies or TV Shows or listen to some quality music, then this phone is EXCELLENT for Usage. Go for the 6GB/128GB variant as some of the RAM and STORAGE is already occupied by the system. The display is good for viewing too... not too bad. PROS I FOUND AFTER MY USER EXPERIENCE:1) Android 11 out of the box, ONE UI CORE 3.1 is awesome and simplistic.2) It has DOLBY ATMOS for headphones which definitely gives a difference.3) The weight and thickness is AVERAGE and you won't even notice anything.4) Fingerprint Scanner is working well and good.5) Some of the Motion and Gestures settings are really cool and useful.6) The HIGHLIGHT of this phone is the Battery, and for me it lasted completely for 3 days straight on normal calls and some youtube.The charging time is worth it for the battery duration. This phone will get updates till android 13 or 14, which is great. The Exynos 850 8nm Processor is working well in terms of speed and smoothness. The 90Hz Refresh Rate is great and I felt the difference in smooth animations. A GREAT FULL ON PACKAGE FOR A NORMAL USER."
Dont Buy this or any samsung device under 20K,1.0,"Dont buy this phoneI bought 4gb 64gb in jan 2022 variant but doesnt match the performanceit doesnt show real time internet speed i had to download extra app for itit has no app lock unlike all the other smartphones. you can only lock the phone.face recognition not very fastno efficient call recording feature, it only saves call when you cut the call, if the other person cuts the call it wont be saved. call recorder also records calls in dont know which quality and are of huge sizes.problems while file sharing.gaming - basic games hang when internet is on.some apps run differently than other android apps.annoying apps like samsung market place which will download unnecessary data from you mobile pack.only 2.4g wifi band.camera takes 48mp photos but only size wise, no good quality. portrait mode is not at all good blurs everything.UPI transactions UI is not optimised.many other software bugs.buy any mi realme device within the same range it has more features and you wont have to bang your head on the wall."
Okay phone,3.0,"Packaging - Bad (Though the item was fulfilled, Amazon?). After few days of usage; okay phone. New software.The battery does not feel like 6000mah; last 24-28 hours on low to just mid-level usage.A heating issue with 20 mins of YouTube watch and a notification is displayed that the device will be automatically turned off due to heating (while charging).The overall company wants to earn with this without much bothering about the value proposition."
If you are a MI user....& travel lover...read this.,3.0,"No doubt it is a good smartphone but I was a MI user before and now facing some problem and some features are missing.here are my reviews on M12:Bettery backup is best ,camera quality normal but front camera is good. Screen size is very big for your pocket,Brightness is harmful for eyes in night eyeprotector is useless, you can add only 3  fingerprint for lock and sensor is wrost place at a very odd position, silence key is missing, 4 camera is a myths, 48mp camera also a myth,  for MI user: no magnitometer it means no compass for North South,  working.  When put earphone no icon show at above you can't know plugged in or not, power button doesn't off the flash light, 3 finger screenshot not working here, C-type charger so you have to take charger everywhere. OTG not supported,  heavy weight, Camera have very limited features like no timelaps video option, no grid view, no screen focus option.  It is a good phone if it will your first phone then it's OK but if you are MI user then in my opinion don't go for this ......."
Don't buy pathetic phone,1.0,"Don't buys it doesn't support LTE plus , it doesn't support 4G plus , it doesn't support 5HZ.Worst phone ever seen.And major issue is that you can not return it.No use at all even you can not book OLA or UBER with mobile sim network internet as speed of sim internet is in very old technology."
Defective Product,1.0,"Purchased mobile on 12th April 2021. IMEI number blocked on 20th April 2021. Enquired with Amazon they just simple told, replacement period over, not able to return the item.Again enquired with Samsung authorized service centre, they told it's a defective product, please discuss with amazon customer care, they only able to replace the item.If this product is purchased from Shop (offline) , maximum 14 days validity for replacement.Now need to change the mother board, it will take minimum 15 days. myself helpless from amazon. Please try to avoid the purchase from amazon."
Awesome Battery and Finger Print sensor,4.0,"Bought it for my mom, she uses it for only calling and basic stuff. It's battery is awesome and easily goes around 3 days. Display is also of good Quality. I really like the side mounted finger print sensor, way better than buggy on screen camera based finger print sensors which merly have suceaa rate of 70% and less. I am using S22 Ultra and I found mine as buggy who doesn't work always, this is 1/12th the price of flagship and have much better finger print sensor on the side."
Decent phone for someone who doesn't use too many apps.,4.0,"Overall the phone is good...huge screen size and battery life is superb! However, I have been facing issues with the performance of the phone. At times it runs slow, inspire of having just the basic apps installed. There are also instances where when I have to click the send button which in some apps is located on the top, it automatically takes me to another app!The only way to solve this issue then is by restarting the phone...and this happens on a daily basis. I have tried reformatting the phone to resolve the issue but it still remains. Also the colours of the photos arnt as dynamic as compared to the Samsung S10."
Good At this Price,4.0,"I'm writing this review after 1 month of use. here is what is faced in this 1month span.cons :1. Auto-restart sometimes without information.2. Messages app having every time.3. Battery is average.4.90 Hz refresh rates stuck your phone.5. Charging Takes 2 hours. the charger is 9w, not 15w.6. Video Quality compromised.7. No App lock inbuilt.8. Installing Google Apps takes a little bit of time.Pros:1. Good and stylish Design.2. smooth User InterFace3. Animations while calling are very descent.Last but not Least At this price This is the best I saw. I know it's so many complications but it's the best mobile at this price.Thanks."
budget king is samsung,5.0,Gifted this samsung m13 for my dad as his birthday giftas he prefers non chinese mobile which is samsung obviouslyand he kind of liked it because of samsung software which can be understandable to senior citizens as wellperformance 4/5camera 3/5battery 5/5 because of 6000mah
Average phone performance. The things said in specifications are not true.,3.0,"There is slag in action at every time you touch the screen so you can feel that it has low quality processor, Touch control is average, camera is average. You will have only 2 benifits for this price (1) Big screen size (2) 64 GB storage."
Totally disappointed,5.0,"Totally disappointed....After 8 monrhs2PROS:▪︎UI 3.0 is amazing. I like it a lot. It is better than Redmi, Moto, Nokia UI. (Subjective)▪︎Amazing battery life. I am getting more than 24hrs of usage after fully charged.CONS:▪︎Worst camera ever. True 48MP is all bulls**t. Low light pics are also worst.Front camera is also not good.▪︎Seriously??? No Slowmotion, Timelapse & other basic features in camera.▪︎It doesn't support Camera2Api which means I cannot download GCam.▪︎Worst Screen resolution. While everyone is giving Super Amoled display & Full HD display, what happened to you Samsung??▪︎90Hz refresh rate is just gimmick.▪︎8nm processor is also waste.▪︎While all others are giving Snapdragon processors, Samsung is stuck with its Exynos which is basically useless. Phone is hanging sometimes.▪︎Phone is a bit heavy and you'll have a hard time with its weight. It's like holding a powerbank.▪︎15Watt charger?? Samsung...you need to upgrade▪︎Wifi only supports 2.5GHz band and no 5.0 GHz bandFinally dont get decieved by True 48MP, 8nm processor, 90Hz refresh rate and other gimmicks. You will be disappointed. I am very much disappointed."
"Got more than expected, at this price point.",5.0,"Much better than expectations and that too a brand like Samsung at this cost. Rest time will tell. But so far everything is just perfect. Was not aware that it had face recognition and finger print read. Though the phone is not that sleek and on the bulkier side, but I think that makes it even more durable and solid. And Rs. 1000/- off on ICICI credit card was icing on cake. Forget other brands. Need not say anything else. Totally impressed. Bought another one in black for my daughter and she too is in awe, even though she was using an IPhone 6 S. And it has been mentioned on the box, that it is manufactured in India. Another plus point. One can go for it with eyes closed, if budget is around Rs. 10k approx. If one is ok and satisfied with the features offered. Happy shopping."
Worst product waste of time and money,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I totally dislike it, please don't but it, this is worst product, it is rubbish,Worst product, totally waste of money, it was a mistake I ordered this item, this is totally rubbish, I was wrong about this, now I want to return this, this is hanging all time, actually it hangs minimum 2 hours, I had buy it on 4th May 2022 but there is worst product I think"
LAGGING PHONE,3.0,"It took me an hour to set up the phone as all the pre installed aps were updating one after the other, making the phone lag. After setup, I had to uninstall all the unnecessary app in order to ensure smooth running of the phone. Each time I try and install a low graphic game the phone starts lagging. The RAM is incapable to handle any low end gaming.  The phone is very bulky and the hands start to hurt if you're watching any video content. All in all, its not what I wanted it to be. Thumbs down!"
Defective phone was sent,1.0,The seller has send the defective phone since many time whenever the call is made  the receiver couldn't hear. Incoming calls too can't be heard. Have contacted the Samsung customer service and they have made ready and have asked to come again. In a day the same problem arises and have to contact again the customer service . Really feeling horrible to have purchased online. Amazon as well as Samsung should ensure the quality and new phone to be delivered to the customer.
Display went dead in 1 Month after purchase,1.0,Bought on 9th March 2022 The display went dead on 23rd April and to my shock when I went to Samsung galaxy they said the phone was activated in 1st week of ja. by some one else before you bought from amazo.
A budget phone for normal users not for Gaming,4.0,A decent phone but not meant for heavy tasking..Screen is  decent..Samsung UI is working good.Sound is Decent ..Charging time is little bit Higher due to huge battery ( Approx 3 Hours for 0-100%)and charging wire is very small.Camera is good.Fingerprint Scanner is decent.Phone is little bit Heavy but its easy to handle.Phone is for  normal user not for gaming as sometime phone feels that exynos 850processor is not providing full power.
Everything works exactly as it should,5.0,Purchased the phone with an exchange offer provided by Amazon.  For the price that you pay this is a good stable device and does its job exactly as it should along with all the app features that comes along with the device.  Though Samsung loads too many bloatware in this phone some of which you won't be able to uninstall and that is frustrating.  If you are a fan of slim and light phones or intend to do heavy gaming then you should look elsewhere.
Disappointed with performance,2.0,"After having used an Mi A2 for about 2 years, this phone was a step down. The prices are similar, and both phones are 4G/64GB.Found this samsung phone thicker, heavier and slower. UI is a bit sluggish. Clear chat on whatsapp is almost always slow (it was very quick on Mi A2). Googlepay PIN keypad does not render properly (some numbers are cropped). A2 has dual speakers with better sound, and a qualcomm processor.The pros of M12 are : display is nicer, the battery is better, and the camera quality is better (don't like the auto play of videos in camera app, haven't found a way to turn it off yet).If I were to choose between the two, would go with Mi A2 (lighter, sleeker, faster, better sound)."
Meets my expectation of battery and strong performance,5.0,I was looking for a phone which had very good battery backup decent camera and strong performance that was my only condition I purchased M12 with 6 GB RAM and other than slow battery charging compared to M 50 and m51 I don't see that there is a huge difference obviously the quality of camera is not going to be as good as the higher range phone but I am happy with the LCD screen to conclude I am very happy with this phone as the battery backup is very good
"Basic smartphone, no frills",3.0,"This phone is a temporary arrangement for me, so my review will be based on that. I don't intend to use this phone for more than 6 months Max.It's a basic smartphone with a decent camera and a long lasting battery. I never liked the heavy samsung UI and the heaviness is felt more on a less powerful phone like this. It takes time to load apps and even basic things like contact search.It's heavy physically too, but I guess it's a trade off for a long lasting battery.Honestly, except for the battery there is pretty much nothing else that I can say good about the phone. For the price I guess it's ok, but the redmi I think does a better job in these prices points.Serves well for me, since this is temp phone and now I am more than anxious to change my phone due to the poor performance of this one."
It's a ok ok phone. Packaging is pretty bad from Samsung.,4.0,There are 3 main things which I was looking for.1. Camera2. Processor3. Looks of the phoneCamera quality is ok. But with wide angle the outer pictures are getting disturbed. It bends on top and bottom side. So not very happy with it. So my rating is.Processor is good. I had gone with 6gb ram so the processing is good. Want to see for few more days.Looks of the phone is ok. The SIM card holder qualify is very poor. I was worried it may break or get stuck while inserting inside the slot. It's more of plastic. I have used other phone's they have a very strong body. It looks more of plastic. Samsung should work on this. Not very impressive with the built.Doesn't give ear phone. Packaging from the company is really bad. Realme or Redmi or vivo covers are far better. In the name of made in India they shouldn't provide such bad quality.At the same price you may find a better phone with similar configuration.
One of the great Samsung 5G phone under 20K,4.0,"If you ask me, the phone worth it if you are looking for 5G in Samsung brand. With a couple of great specks like Samsung's #FastestMonster equipped with the blazing fast Snapdragon 750G processor. It comes with a long lasting 5000 mAh battery and a versatile 48MP Quad camera for capturing stunning photos and videosCons: though Super AMOLED Infinity-U 6.6” display gives a true-to-life to mobile, indeterminately display clarity would not that great since it is just HD one. At last even I don’t like the in-screen security as it would not work as expected, that maybe I have not used to it since I am trying 1st time and I am blind person though."
Awesome phone,5.0,"Wonderful phone from Samsung. I have purchased for my sister and she liked it very much and very excited after getting the phone. Specially time of delivery was very impressive, received it within 24 hrs after placing the order. Thanks to Amazon for delivering smiles."
Again Disappointed with Samsung phone quality,1.0,"I purchased the product on the launch day, got product delivered yesterday. Phone looks decent but the camera quality is not worth a penny. It was mentioned 50 MP. but photo looks blurred both in rear camera and front camera. In case it's a manufacturing defect , I think company should come forward and revert. But one of worst camera phone so far."
Great phone pocket friendly,5.0,"Got this phone for my dad who loves YouTube and watching news.Pros: Great battery life (need charging once in two days with moderate use), Supports fast charging, No Androidware thus very smooth UI and no lag, excellent 4 camera in rear and brilliant front facing camera, Runs on latest Android and processor is quite peppyCons: Slightly bigger in length and little heavy compared to others, Future Android upgrades not clear, Not 5G enabledTips: I got this phone under 9.5K so wait for the right deal."
Read this before you buy,5.0,"I purchased this phone few days ago because it has got a good rating. But I forgot one universal line that - SAMSUNG PHONE ALWAYS HANG.The fingerprint is in the side button which is not that good and the biggest con of that is if you press the side button just to see the time and notification on lockscreen,. It will automatically unlock the phone. Again you have to click that to lock it and if by mistake you double click it, it will again get unlocked."
Economic but great to have,4.0,"Pros1. Big display phone2. Very good battery life3. Not heating on usage4. Good sound/audio5. For my usage,  good processing speed and good RAMCons1. Touch screen is not very accurate- I am having to click on a button multiple times to get it clicked2. Like, MI, Samsung has Samsung apps that though useless to me constantly keep running and updating and occupy memory and cannot be deleted3. Brightness control is not good - max brightness and min brightness have less difference4. Camera is ok"
Good in budget mobile,4.0,"*Screen refresh rate is good.*Camera is not like premium but good in budget.Camera is decent, more * features are there.*Able to feel weight and after screen guard and back cover it feels so bulky.*Side Fingerprint sensor is not comfortable with back cover slot.*It was difficult to choose perfect back cover and screen guard for this mobile.*As in all other samsung, mobile getting heating up on more app usage."
Timeless Budget Warrior !,5.0,"After usage of 6 months, I'm satisfied with the smartphone. In this budget, this is possibly one of the best offerings. In the world of Android,nowadays Samsung possibly has the best offerings in every price range.Camera is OK enough. At least OK for a 10k phone.Sound quality is loud and clear, with display of good quality. Ganes and consumption of multimedia is enjoyable.Interface is clean and multitasking is smooth. Charging is fast enough. Obviously, the best part is it's massive battery and power usage. With moderate use, it can easily go past 2 days and that is a big plus for people always on the go.In the 10-11k category, this is possibly the best I've used so far. This is a phone for ages to keep.Thanks to Amazon, delivery was in perfect condition.P.S. Before buying, even I was skeptical reading some of the negative reviews. I'm a common user, and my understanding is if you're expecting top of the line performance from a budget phone, then your expectations are to be blamed. Or most of the bad reviews are sponsored ones.If you want top of the line, you gotta spend top of the line.This phone gets the BASICS right, and that is what matters in the long run. And no phone in this category will offer a truly top class camera; even if they do,they will compromise in some other areas. Whereas, M12 with its 8nm efficient structure along with a Trusted Chip Set gets the job done in a smooth manner. Overall, if you want Smooth operations with Reliability, trust Samsung M12."
Awesome phone,5.0,"Samsung Galaxy M12 features a 6.5-inch HD+ Infinity V display with 720x1600 pixel resolution. The smartphone display comes with a 90Hz refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 is the only smartphone in this price range to come with this high refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 comes with an adaptive refresh rate which means that the panel cannot be locked at a high refresh rate. The high refresh rate display functioned smoothly during scrolling through Facebook and Instagram. For some reason, the refresh rate on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is locked at 60Hz for the notification centre. Also, the 90Hz mode is turned off while using apps like YouTube. Despite the high refresh rate and HD+ resolution, the display on Samsung Galaxy M12 is not that sharp and vibrant. The brightness is also not great and you might face some struggle while using the smartphone under direct sunlight. The display is large enough for you to enjoy movies and also play games. The display also comes with an eye comfort shield which reduces the blue light from the screen and prevents eye strain. The display on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is decent but it is definitely not the selling point of the handset."
"Battery, overall performance is really awesome.",5.0,"Good buy within the price  range, this thing is powerfull, the one's looking for performance this is the product, 6 gb ram with 128gb to access with is worthy. The system has variety  of settings to choose from, this might get slow when google drive is being used for contacts and other things as it directly fetches data from drive but there are other settings you can play with and enjoy games at a very good speed.. And the charger is powerful.Recommendation for games: try games from ppsspp emulator."
Will not purchase anything for my self now from Amazon,1.0,"first of all the delivery of the phone was late.Which timeline does Samsung is living in?No Magnetometer (Compass app not working)The phone seams useless to my Wife,as she needs compass on regular basis.We thought that it must be there in the phoneAs you guys do not show all the exect features of the phone.even auto brightness is not working properly.Not getting any massage for second sim.Now we are stuck with this phone.We can't even return it because of your policy."
BLOATWARE BY SAMSUNG,1.0,"I bought Samsung to get less bloated OS but Samsung has gone shameless like it's peers MI and realme. OS is bloated and I hate the skin. I'm going to install a custom rom after a year.I bought it for my mom, she doesn't know how to protect her privacy and data and Samsung is exploiting it. Shame.I disabled these apps(in photo), I use micro g services instead of Google, but I can't disable some Samsung apps."
"Battery, Camera and Screen",5.0,"Awesome budget phone with all the features that is required for daily use like 6000 mah battery which last upto 1 day after internet serving, watching videos, listening music and lot more.Screen resolution and screen size is really well in this budget and you can't expect better than this within this budget.Processor is also good for normal and average use, its not made for playing heavy graphics game like PUBG, COD, Asphalt etc. You can go for it if you are looking for something with a decent spec and long lasting quality.I'm a samsung user, I am using samsung since last 9+ years and I can claim that samsung gives the best quality product amongst all the other brands except Apple.Camera perfomance is really well as per 48 mp. The only thing is its bit unstable in night time. You may require some extra light for taking pictures in night."
It's not even had 5ghz wifi connectivity.its a worse phone ever purchased.,1.0,"Never go.for this phone. It will make u frustrated just after 1 day of use.No 5ghz wifiNot even good camera (no multiple features)Not good fingerprint sensorNot good speakerNot at all good micIn short total waste of money.After use of 6 months- very low range of wifi,Bluetooth and now it started to hang.Worst product ever to buy from samsung."
Very Nice,5.0,AfterUpdating  Play Store appsSamsung softwareGalaxy appsWorking Very NicePreviously  I face Lot of Hanging Problem with My Phone 6gb / 128 gbButAfter Updating  ......Working Very NiceThanks to Amazon and SellerCamara is very Nicebut I sawso many Negative  Reviews on camara...it's 100 percent WrongEvery thing is Very Good in this PhonePurchase it ...Blindly.....
Just fine,4.0,"Good--Battery runs for 2 normal days--Fingerprint sensor on power button is more convenient--Video experience is goodNot good--It is not detecting 5 GHz Wifi channel. I can't make use of my high speed internet--Fast charging is not really fast in charging. It takes 1.5 Hrs to fully charge--I checked performance using benchmark app, this is scoring half of realme 3 pro--Heavier than realme & redmi phones with similar battery power"
Best Affordable Phone from Samsung till date!,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It is best at this cost from a brand like samsung. Display resolution is HD but it's 90 Hz. Battery life is awesome lasts 2 days. Camera is disappointing though. There isn't any gcam available yet. No silicon case in box. One UI is the best UI I have ever used yet. Fast updates. 15 Watt charger included takes almost 2 hrs for full charge which lasts for almost 2 days"
Totally Recommendes,5.0,"I bought this smartphone for my mom where my only requirement is good battery and a decent camera. I must say it satisfies my requirements pretty well. The battery life is really great that my mom's usage is quite common like watching youtube and scrolling through whatsapp. The battery sustains for two days with her usage pattern and I'm happy with that. The bigger battery makes the smartphone bulky but thats worth compromising. Totally a decent camera, fantastic battery life and a 90hz screen feels smooth. I'd totally Recommend this if your necessity is pretty basic."
Really wrost product,1.0,"Within 6 months Speaker of phone got Damaged and now getting the WROST SOUND, CRACKLING SOUND WHILE GETTING CALLS, PLAYING MUSIC, WATCHING VIDEOS.I SPOKE TO SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTER OVER THEIR OFFICIAL WHAT'S APP CHAT NUMBER ALSO SEND EMAIL TO SAMSUNG INDIA STILL THERE IS NO SOLUTIONAGENT DIDN'T RESOLVE CONCERNS AND UNABLE TO RAISE ESCALATIONS.TWO OF THE AGENTS FROM SAMSUNG GAVE ME WRONG REFERENCES NUMBER MIS GUIDED ME AND ENDED THE CHAT."
Only for normal peoples.,4.0,I prefer this phone only for normal people. In some times there will be small hang. This is not a Gaming phone. We can play candy crush etc. But this is not capaple to play pubg etc.
Battery performance improved after latest update,4.0,I took this mobile for the battery performance.. and it was one of best phone i ever seen.. last month it was taking upto 2 days to drain the battery... then after one update.. it became worst it is taking only 20 hrs to drain complete battery.. and during night time also it is taking around 25 % battery. before update it was taking hardly 1 % battery in night times..worst part of the software it is not even showing which app takes more battery..With the latest update the battery and phone performance got very good..Camera is improved a lot..auto brightness setting is still take lots of time to settle.. sometimes it does not works need to adjust manually..Overall best phone with price point..
Overall a very good phone at the price,5.0,The overall look of the phone is good.The features available at this pricing is excellentThe camera quailty is a bit disappointing specially the front camera.There are very few button option and many are missing which is available in the button menuLot of features are also missing in camera.Battery life is very very good listening to music watching movies and day long games .Overall a good phone at the given price rangeHappy to be a SAMSUNG mobile Fan
Not worth it,2.0,Simply you better to skip this phone I break my old screen so suddenly I need to buy I brought this because I get it in good price but after I receive I realized it's simple useless 🤣 my old 3gb ram phone (I brought in 2018) 100 times better than this it's easily struck most of time touch doesn't working screen just break because I sleep on it you can't play pubg in it no games you can't use much outside in summer or do work much it's easily shut down phone easily over heat many problems .. people who need phone for simple thing like calling watching YouTube better to buy this
Terrible connectivity and network both mobile data & hotspot & also UI not user-friendly,2.0,"Having trouble with network connection for mobile data access & hotspot also.User interface also not user-friendly. Heavy to handle for prolonged usege.Call recorder toggle switch also not found during call screen buttons.Not even gestures available for emergency torch light on & off. Only available in notification switch panel.Connection issue faced while browsing, YouTube thumbnail not showing, Facebook buffering to play video & scrolling got struck repeatedly and even browser app update also could not complete even after several attempts in playstore.Battery backup performance was also not satisfied even when 6000MAH capacity configuration with 6GB RAM / 128GB STORAGE available.Very embarrassing experience with this new Samsung Galaxy M12 after 3 years smooth usage with my present device(redmi y2)."
Review after agressive using for 2 days,3.0,"To be honest i was totally skeptical whether i should buy this phone or not,  seeing so many negative comments, I took the risk and bought it..After using the phone aggressively for 2 days i must say as i read from the reviews that this phone Hangs on operation which is totally FALSE .Phone totally works fine. Having a refresh rate of 90Hz the phones doesn't show any delay, the UI is smooth battery is quite strong . Using aggressively at max only consumed 46% of battery in two days (discharged from 100% to 54%).The only thing that will disappoint you is its Camera Which works like a 6-8MP camera.Macro shots are not that detailed either.Front camera is just like having a 2-3 MP camera.Samsung should have uplifted camera quality when they mentioned it with 48MP camera.This phone will disappoint you in terms of camera quality.Rest the phone just works very well in terms of other configurations."
A good mobile,5.0,"This is my second Samsung Android after ON7 Pro and third smart phone in 8 years. I like to continue with my existing device for a long time until it no longer supports essential apps like Banking, Cabs, Utilities etc. I'm not a photographer and hence camera quality doesn't matter to me and neither gaming. Smart phone for me is a device that satisfies my professional needs and household needs. This is a fine device, quite fast and lots of space to keep my essential apps. Touchscreen is good even after having installing a thick screen guard. I am using a thick transparent backcover with extra security at 4 corners and no problem in charging after that. Battery is great and for my kind of usage one full charge is good for 48 hours usage. My bluetooth headset works fine with this device. Hence I'm 100% satisfied and hope to continue it for atleast 4 years."
Battery drain on using internet whether wifi or mobile internet,1.0,"I don't have any games on my phone and no sm app apart from twitter. My phone usage about 98 % comprises of reading my mails and attachments i.e. pdf, doc, xls files etc. and voice calls. Overall my phone usage is less since I work from home mostly from my laptops. But the battery drain is visible within just 3 months of use. The use of mobile internet is also low and I usually work with wifi but the power drain is significant while using internet. I have checked if any app is draining battery but didn't find anything. All this claim of 6000 mah is disappointing. I will probably take my phone to the service centre soon."
Smooth Experience with this phone,5.0,"I ordered the phone for my uncle, he is very happy to get the 5G phone in a very good budget with all the features he needed to rollout his day to day activities. We do the migration from old phone to this new Samsung phone for him, everything seems smooth and working as per the expectations so far. Also, we got 2K additional discount through SBI card. It was a good deal and worth it."
Pathetic Product.,1.0,"Samsung refused to replace screen citing physical damage. As the entire phone is already covered under warranty for any factory defects, there was no need to mention 6 month free screen replacement separately. Had I known this, I would have taken an Insurance. This is clearly a very bad customer experience from a well known brand like samsung. In my eyes, it has already tranished the high brand image for samsung I had. I feel deeply cheated."
Best batteryPretty good deal .Luv Samsung and Amazon for fast delivery and deals,4.0,This phone is the best in this price range with best battery and camera performance. I would have more pleased if it had an amoled display . Surely Samsung had the ability to imply an amoled screen but they didn't . They could have used Snap dragon 600 series chipset instead of the exynos. But still this is the best phone under this budget. Better that A21s of Samsung . It's the best 10k budget phone now. Don't get confused with f12 it's just same as M12.
Good phone in budget range with almost all necessary features,5.0,"Good phone in budget range with almost all necessary features .It would have been a great experience if they would have given S secure support in M12 as well ,like M21. Due to core UI you will get basic version of Knox without secure folder and all.Camera quality is decent , good battery backup though the phone is little heavy ,Display also good except I can see some flickering effect while scrolling down webpages with 90hz refresh rate. I did not face any issues with processor or ram for the daily use. USB type c port supports OTG .Speaker is also ok , but it is not sterio.Network quality also good .Overall I am satisfied with the purchase ."
Samsung cannot make good quality cheap phones!,1.0,"I bought this phone along with the similar priced Xiaomi Note variant and the difference is absolutely noticeable.The fingerprint does not work, at all!The wifi calling feature of the phone is worse than the actual mobile network (which is pathetic in itself)!WhatsApp will not work, all throughout the day.I suggest ya'll go with the usual competitors and ignore Samsung in the cheaper range, altogether!"
Good phone but disappointed with camera,3.0,Everything is good in this phone camera is okay in daylight means if your facing the source of light your photo will be good but at night the photos are poor and there is no other problem but I was disappointed because the company says true 48MP camera and it has quad camera setup but the photos are not up to mark the photos of my redmi 9 prime which has 13MP QUAD Camera setup are excellent far better than m12
Samsung's worst phone,1.0,"This is by far the worst phone from Samsung. I upgraded from old Galaxy on7 pro to this one because it promised better OS, better screen refresh rate, better storage and better camera quality. But to my dismay, none of these is a wow factor in this phone except for battery life. The phone hangs every 5-10mins with only 2 apps running. The screen response rate is pathetic and camera quality below par, not sure what they mean by 48MP camera. Don't take this phone even if someone offers it to you for free. It's a headache more than a utility. I would urge Amazon to bring down such a pathetic product from their website because it will spoil their brand name as well."
4 stars,4.0,"Samsung M12, Generally speaking a standard phone. If you've used Redmi phones before, you might feel this one is not that great. Not that fast compared to redmi . Camera is ok to this price range."
"Price Reduced, So Quality Reduced",2.0,"Samsung boasting 48mp camera but really cheated may be due to price reduction..The 48mp camera quality is like 5 mp. Front camera 2mpIf you want to just have a Samsung for namesake it is OK.Battery backup boasted 6000 MAH. But like 3000 mah. 20 minutes photos+10 mins video - battery drained superbly from 92% to 65%.My old blackberry Q10, i thing 8mp rear camera-so so accurate and high quality pictures.Those who require good quality camera better look for other choices."
It's been month Amazon has not paid my refund.,1.0,"I bought this mobile in second week of Jan, received on 18Jan. Noticed mobile has issues. Contacted CC they scheduled inspection which they rescheduled 3 times then last time inspection guy called and asked about the issue and said we can replace or refund. We called CC &raised return request . It's now a month we have received our refund and Amazon CC promise always they will help us return the mobile and get the refund. However from a month Amazon has kept my 10000. This is pinnacle of frustration. We have been calling CC to get out refund and all we get is false promises. This is really disheartening 😒. Amazon has lost trust of a customer. First they sent damaged mobile and now not giving us our money and taking their mobile back. Such shame"
Poor performance  M13 4G 6GB RAM 128 Gb variant,3.0,"I got this phone 6GB AM 128 GB 4G Variant, I didn't install any games or high end software. I used only intagram, it started hanging in the middle performance is very poor. Not good if you use your phone for more time.Maybe you consider gifting for elder people who use minimally.Camera is fine for the price range.Battery life is okayFingerprint reader works fine"
Detailed review,4.0,"Its a budget phone and I'm using it from this January, phone is bit bulky but its battery life makes it invincible. Look the name samsung is enough to describe its reliability. You will get good camera i just said good don't make any kind of expectation which can fullfill your camera desires. Good screen , huge storage (go for 128Gigs ) and RAM is also helps you to do multi tasking. I never played any game on my phone but it will help you to feed your hunger for gaming. For me thums up for it. You can get M12 if you are considering my review helpful."
Battery is the key,5.0,"I bought this device for my mother, and she loved it. It’s great device considering the price at it was available for me.Pros:1. Great battery life.2. Decent display (90Hz is a plus point)3. Decent processor for general purpose.Cons:1. Cameras are not that great.2. Only 720p display. (1080p display could be the best option)3. I hate samsung security updates because they install lot of junks apps with update.Note: I don’t prefer this device for gaming. The processor in this one is not a gaming one.  Also, the device may face heating issues even if playing small size games."
Not good model from Samsung,1.0,"Unnecessary apps automatically download on their own. We can't control them. Any number of times you uninstall them, again, they will download and install without our role. There are no settings in phone to control them. Very nuisance.Screenshot is not working.  Overall working and performance is not up to mark even for this price level. Some other model from Samsung or other brands or honor are best alternatives."
Value for money,5.0,"The features offered by this device at the price range are fabulous. There is no lag during the usage. The display is good for watching youtube, netflix etc. The camera is decent w.r.t. the price at which you get it. For gaming, it is optimized for no lag.Perfect optimized performance at this price range. Call quality and speakers are good enough."
Never buy. Samsung has disappointed. Amazon must have check on spurious products,1.0,"I had bought m21 and m01 before. m01 is better in performance than this one (m12).Either the product is substandard from samsung or from STPL seller.Camera quality not as per specs. Touch is not responsive. phone lagging.This time both amazon, samsung and stpl have disappointed me. Feel like cheated by this spurious product.No return policy either. even replacement has been made cumbersome. Beware now to buy online products from amazon. Recently I have been having very bad experiences."
Great budget smartphone from Samsung,5.0,Great budget smartphone from Samsung.Got a bit worried after reading all the negative reviews about the phone's display and camera but they didn't fail me or Samsung. Great battery life and display looks awesome. Camera is normal; neither extremely extraordinary nor disappointing. Overall camera is satisfactory at this price. RAM and Processor give very smooth performance. Don't get worry about the bullshit negative reviews (by people who want gold at the price of brass).  Go for it.
Best budget phone at this Price,5.0,"Writing this after 4 months if heavy usagePros:-1. Very very big battery life. This battery is so big that you can easily use it for 2days with moderate use.2. Very beautiful screen even though it is LCD. Samsung has not used any cheap screen. You can enjoy your Movies and Web-Series.3. Very good camera ultra wide mode is just so beautiful you don't need panaroma mode in this. Selfie camera is just awesome .4. You even get headphone jack.5. The screen is pretty big best for online classes and binge watching.6. I have played games like BGMI, CODM, NFS with ease.My final opinion is that you should buy this phone if you want to do online classes, play games, or if you want a phone with big battery or if you are a binge watcher. You can download almost 70 movies with ease."
Too much heavy and performance is not as expected.,2.0,Good budget phone but not for youngers suitable to low average user.As a multitasking purpose please dont buy.Problem in wifi speed .When wifi and bluetooth both are running the wifi internet speed is slowdown.Screen resolution and quality is really like MI cheap phone not like samsung .This is my 5th samsung smartphone and this time i am really disappointed.
Average phone considering price range,3.0,"Average phone considering price range.1. Camera quality: average, no slow motion or time lapse feature available, no zoom when using 48mp. Front camera, below average. Sometimes I take a photo that doesn't get stored, quite annoying.2. Weight: quite heavy, you feel the difference when you take some other phone in your hand.3. screen type: lcd not led or amoled4. Batter life: looks good with normal usage.5. Phone body: back panel looks like of plastic, it would have been better if matelic had been used.6: user interface: sometimes very hard to do something, like taking a screenshot. Could have been given some better option to do that. Also, I use night model, where it gets better into grayscale in night, I can't customize some options like what apps and what type of do not disturb I want, also if had turn it off in some urgent cases I have to go back into settings and then disable it. Not an easy option provided.Face recognition: not fast and accurate."
Decent performance. Faulty battery. Poor touchscreen,2.0,"Product is below average performance. Battery is horrible. Takes 5 hours to charge from zero to 100This is unacceptable considering its a a new phone. Seems like used parts have been put. Amazon is sending old phones now apparently as this isn't the performance of a new phone out of the boxEdit- have got a replacement and this works fine, much better in all aspects of performance"
Wonder phone one must possess for multiple usages.,5.0,Wonderful product. Power packed. Very handy. Easy to operate. Light weight. Value for mon ey. Excellent phone I have ever come across. Powerful battery lasting very long between recharges. I used it for whole day still battery dropped very little. Amazing. No heating  up of battery even after long continuous usage. Very sleek and thin design. Large RAM  and ROM. Delivery by Amazon was on time. Overall five stars without any hesitation.
Jailbroken mobile was sent.,1.0,"while installing certain software form goole play store, it says mobile is jail broken. if possible please ask your customer care to contact me. even if not possible, please dont send such devices to customers. please dont buy samsung."
Not a great product,2.0,"The phone fails to match up the performance with my previous phone which I bought 3 years before unfortunately the same maker had started focusing on different segments of smartphone. The most honest let down of this phone is the response  when you click on screen, Time taken to open a app, movement between pages and many more latency issues which I can connect to processor of this phone. I had bought 6 gb ram model still the performance is not upto basic expectations from this segment phone. NOT A GREAT CHOICE.. REGRET EACH TIME FOR SELECTING THIS MODEL WHENEVER I USE."
Dabba phone not even supports 5g,1.0,"Samsung is hiding the details and selling this dabba phone. Not a clever move. It's not 5G phone and no where it is mentioned, battery life they claim It's 6000mah but I don't see it as great. Camera quality is not upto the mark. Phone is very much heavier. I am surprised to see that it doesn't have a 5g even 2022 where now we have all the is providing 5g support and you can't even connect to 5g wifi. I am very much disappointed  by this phone and it doesn't have a resale value as well. Stay away from it. I do not recommend this phone. Rather I would suggest you to go for reminders note 10 pro"
Ok product,3.0,Overall 3star.. very bulky and a slightly heavier phone. Could work on the bulk and weight of the phone. After a few updates the phone slows down. Samsung needs to work on the performance of the phone. I have been using the phone for 2 months now (6gb ram 128gm rom) and I feel that the performance has slowed in just 2 months. At times there is lag and the phone screen stops responding completely. The pages get stuck and the screen touch also gets weird.Problem areas to sum up1) heavy 2) bulky 3) touch screen is not that great4) slowness of the phoneGood things1) battery life (as of now) 2) camera 3) finger print reader 4) ok phone for basic usage
Worthy Mid Budget Phone,3.0,"Pros:1. Looks elegant2. Camera is good3. Budget Friendly4. Battery is really good, stands for days with minimal usageCons:1. Bulky and really heavy for smaller hands2. Bit of heating issues when playing High end games3. Too many bloatwares. I wouldn't expect a Android One experience. But this is flooded with so many preinstalled softwares . but some of them has uninstall option."
Value for money product,5.0,"Samsung Galaxy M12 can be a good choice for customers who are looking for a Samsung smartphone under Rs 15,000. The smartphone offers a quad-rear camera, HD+ display and is backed by a 6000mAh battery which can easily last for two days. Camera quality is real good.  Fingerprint scanner is fast and responsive sound quality is betterHowever the phone is on the heavier side ,Does not comes with the clear case and headphones and you might want to add a good screen guard and case .Thank you"
Great option for general long term use,5.0,"A great device (on the heavy side) for general usage.Ordered for mom who uses WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube. Battery lasts for at least 2 days easily.The camera quality is good enough for this price range and good to see the latest Android 11 onboard. 4 years of updates makes it worth the investment for long term usage."
Samsung Galaxy M12 is a Grand mobile phone,5.0,"Purchased Samsung Galaxy M12 mobile phone to replace an under preforming mobile. Have been using this phone for the last one month.It is lovely in appearance. Has decent storage capacity, quick data retrieval capability, good Battery life. Camera performance is commendable.I recommend Samsung Galaxy M12 mobile phone for those who are looking for a good mobile phone with decent performance."
Total Waste of money,1.0,Product is not working properly got replaced but the issue is still presist and will not be rwolved in near future.I do not that how may buyer are receiving this issue bit I am getting that issue.In phonepe when I enter upi pin that keyboard number are cutting in half size.That is the issue and heating so on..Sound tones are changing automatically.Loud speaker is not working on call. No voice come out in laud speaker on call..:(
Worth it.,5.0,Its a good product.Battery: it last for an entire day. in my case it last for around 36 hrs.Camera: Main camera of 48 pm is really good.Fingerprint: works like a charm.It's a very good budget phone and best thing is the design. It's same as other samsumg phone. Phone looks elegant.
I think Best ever samsung phone in lower Budget range..Too Good than Xiaomi.,5.0,"Excellent Battery life, for normal use upto 3 days..Camera Quality is too good, finger print works very fast...No preintalled unwanted apps... Also have option to disable system apps...So u can fully utilise ur RAM...With single speaker Voice Quality is too good... Display quality is also best..Body structure - feels strong and tough.Charging time - 2 hr 40 min approx.I got this in ₹ 10.5k.As compared to Xiaomi's phone...If you are planning for long term use.. then this phone is best for you..... with rough and tough uses.I think for normal user just go for it....👍👍👍👍👍👍👌"
"Latest Android 11 device, as expected in all respects.",4.0,"Good quality Samsung phone for general use (6gb ram/128gb). Android 11 out of the box, which is important for security and software compliance/updates for a londer time. Good camera. Excellent battery life (2.5- 3 days with non gaming, sparse content viewing). Better than cheap chinese wannabes in quality and comes with Samsung reliability amd latest Android 11, even though it may be nominally behind in a specification or two.."
Not expected from Samsung,3.0,"The phone is excellent. The call quality is good too. Everything is satisfactory or much better than expected.The major glitch, however, is non-operational USB tethering. It simply doesn’t work.So if you want a phone that needs to be taken to the service station the minute you switch it on, if you cannot live with a faulty phone or if you must have USB tethering, keep away from this Samsung."
"At this price range, it is very good but the features get compromised at some places.",3.0,"I expected a better camera UI from Samsung. You don't get any option for slow motion or hyperlapse. It is a very ordinary camera UI. The phone is quit thick and heavy than other phones. It may cause a hindrance if you are used to with light phones. I have to say that the battery life is really massive! With normal usage you can easily operate it for 2 days. The 90Hz refresh rate of this phone is very captivating. At this range, it is really a good deal but make sure you put a case and a screen guard in it 'cause it doesn't have any gorilla glass protection."
Service center is saying it is open piece,1.0,This is really irritating that I ordered this phone as brand new and within few months now the power button is not working. When I took out to the service center they r saying it is open piece and blaminge that I have opened it. They need money to replace the cap inside the button. Never expected this from Amazon to give me a used piece or Samsung service center is playing a game for money.
Pathetic product,1.0,"Undoubtedly this has been the worst mobile phone of my life till now. Writing this review after 2 years of purchase. The processor used in m21 handsets is cheap and has heating issues. Then phone started switching off after 1year and few months. Motherboard needs to be replaced. I mean that is simply fooling people. Hand them a handset of 17k and within a year ask them to replace the motherboard worth 7k. So, please don't buy any phone having the same processor. Check news articles on the same. Samsung m series is a failure."
Slower than 2GB RAM mobile phone.. Don't buy,1.0,"Too slow, touch response is very slow. Camera is poor.. Ram plus is a scam.... Hangman lost to M13..... Not worth 10k...... Tecno, Realme, Mi are better options....... Don't fall for brand and buy Samsung........"
Good mid-budget phone for elderly people,4.0,"I had bought this phone for my father-in-law. He is pretty satisfied with the performance. Battery life is amazing for him (he does not use phone much, apart from occasional calling and receiving calls, and checking whatsapp twice daily), and he is getting 3-3.5 days of battery-life after one full charge.We know that we can get better phones from other brands in this range, but for elderly, the ease of use of Samsung OneUI is really a tipping factor for deciding on this phone."
OK PHONE BUT CAMERA QUALITY IS WASTE,3.0,"Pros:1. Perfect battery life...lasts you till 1.5 day with heavy usage.2. 90Hz display is smooth.3. The software is excellent...everything just flows..from school through settings to multi-tasking is smooth 👌Cons:1. This phone is very heavy and thiccc...2. Phone lags while doing heavy usage.3. Camera is just below average 🙄 at 11,000....4. Phone heats up very quickly.5. Display quality is just OK because of HD+....better to buy Redmi 9 Power OR POCO M3Verdict: It is better to buy REDMI 9 POWER IF YOU WANT AN 1. BEST BATTERY2. FULL HD+ DISPLAY3. BEST CAMERA WITH 48MP4. FAST CHARGER IN-THE BOX...22W FAST CHARGER5. 4GB+64GB  -OR-POCO M31. BEST BATTERY2. FULL HD+ DISPLAY3. BEST CAMERA WITH 48MP4. FAST CHARGER IN-THE BOX...22W FAST CHARGER5. AND WITH 6GB RAM 😱+ 64GB"
A good option to consider in this price range,2.0,"Everything about this phone is good but there are some problems also like processor is bit slow so you will see a very small lag b/w input and output. Too much heavy and width is also too much and it definitely don't looks like 2021 model phone bcz of weight and width of phn specially when technology has so advanced that there are too slim and light weight phns available in the market; it took like phn is from 2015 something. Screen's performance is definitely not upto the mark.I'm a student and I  generally use laptop for much of my work and uses mobile very little, so can't give that much detailed review about everything but yeah I can say one thing that  if you are a student than it will definitely serve the purpose for which you will buy it."
"Awesome phone, very long battery life, great feel",5.0,"I am writing this review after 3 days of usage. I have upgraded to this phone from a Redmi 5A. Looks and feel are simply amazing. The usage experience is also superb. The battery life seems to be v v long, when compared to my last phone. Overall, I am very happy and satisfied with this purchase. Seems like a real upgrade from my old Redmi 5A... and, to top it all, Amazon gave me an exchange offer worth Rs. 2500 on my 3 year old Redmi 5A... I have nothing to complain.Last but not the least, the delivery experience was also superb... delivered within 2 days !!! And the delivery guy was also very helpful and patient as it took more than half an hour to reset my old phone before handing it over to him.Overall a 5 star experience... However, I would have loved to give a 6-star for battery life as well as the delivery experience."
Display issue with in 10 days of purchase,1.0,"Had a display issue and screen lag immediately within the first week, but the return window expired, can't get a replacement told amazon customer care, forced to take it to the Samsung Service centre they got the phone and asked me to wait a minimum of 20 days or more to get the display fixed to cover it under warranty. no options.  even a new release phone doesn't have a spare for India's leading market share mobile company."
phone not working,1.0,"i bought this phone from amazon with in 6 months of my purchase , one day it just got heated up in my hand and went blank i went to samsung auth repairs and i was told that its mother board has corrupted and needs to get changed but it is not covered in warranty then what the warrenty is for they asked 9000 to repair it so i have no choice but leave it that way lost 110000 rs will never buy samsung product ever"
Good,5.0,My usage is mostly emails n what's app and a few apps sometimes. Have been using it for over 4months. Is a good product. Happy with the battery life till now. Camera is ok types. Good product in this price range.
Best budget phone,5.0,"This model has similar features as other Samsung mobiles. The camera quality is not that great but I don't mind I don't click much pictures anyway, it's not the best camera but it's not that bad. In this price range, I think this is the best deal I've got 6GB RAM, 128 internal memory, expandable up to 1TB with 6000mAH battery and I must say battery life is amazing.Since I trust the brand I always go for Samsung."
Amazing battery backup. Last 2 days,5.0,"Amazing blue colour,If you need battery backup phone and have extream use of phone stock market trader like me, go for it without second thought. Superb battery. 100% would last 1.5 or 2 days.Processor is not good enough to handle game. So it's not gaming phone.Screen refresh rate is quite good.I returned my third class POCO F1 in 8k by cashify and bought this one. I got good deal.Camera quality is not good enough.. you need to on 48mp always."
"Good in this budget, but things could be improved",4.0,"Although its a good budget/entry level mobile phone from Samsung, but build quality could be improved, you can also get full HD resolution in other brands in this price range, but this comes with 720 resolution only.If you want to use only youtube, whatsapp and basic smartphone function, then its a good phone."
Awesome phone,4.0,"According to me this phone worth for money, each and every money worth for it. It's been 10 days I'm using this phone.. really impressed me a lot. It's camera quality is amazing, but remember it only works properly in well enlightened region. It doesn't take such good quality images in dark beacuse night mode is not present. It doesn't support slow motion. But on an average we can give 4/5 rating to camera. Coming to performance, it lottery so good. You can experience some lag of about 0.5 second in between your work. But it doesn't affect so much.  It has so good refresh rate, which make it looking smooth while scrolling. But display is not so good. According to me I can give only 3/5 rating to display. Not so good and not so bad, it can be in between it. Eye comfort shield in the display settings is really so bad, worst !!! Dark mode in the mobile is quite amazing.. you can experience the darkness level similar to Amoled display. Fingerprint sensor is really so fast. Audio is not so nice and loud as expected. But can be heard if you get used to it, as you use it in daily life. And apperance, looking is really awesome. Even when the weight of mobile is 221 gm, it doesn't make it so much heavy.. you can easily use it.I really finds it really awesome, this phone is good option to buy in low price.. I don't think any phone will be better than this at this price."
Average mobile,3.0,"After using this mobile for 2 months I would say its an ordinary mobile for adults who are average users.As i said its an average mobile, good call clarity and user interface.Overall mobile is quite slow (you wont feel like its 4G RAM) even the contact search will take few seconds.Camera is below average 48 mega pixel is not upto the mark (I have used 48 mega pixek redmi note 7 pro) video clarity is very bad, selfie camera is the worst.Macro lens is not clear.Irrespective of the apps you use it will be slow. I don't play games but for sure its not suitable for playing heavy games.Battery is good will come for more than 2.5 days with normal usage. Best for elders.Display is okay.Side mounted finger print sensor is cool.Price is quite high with the above drawbacks."
Solid Battery Backup,5.0,"I was looking for solid battery backup phone.. and I found one. M12 is awesome in battery backup,  display is great. Finger print sensor is flawless..Overall a good second phone for my needs..This is going to be a great,Samsung budget phone..I had one incident too , I slipped the phone in a bucket full of water,  I took it out immediately and its working fine..."
Good product but laden with bloatware,4.0,"In this price range it is a good buy. However, not only this but Samsung in general have a bloatware issue. The phone won't work unless you sign in to all the unnecessary bloatware apps built in the OS skin.. apparently the company knows much more details about its consumers than necessary, and this can pose serious privacy issues for some."
"Battery good, price is good.",5.0,"The honest review could have been 2.5* considering, performance & camera quality, yet I'm giving it 5* because : when i was about to buy this phone i was on a budget and this was the best option for me, a 6/128 model of a top brand at 13500RS was a good deal and my top priority always was battery back and this amused me with its battery back up. If you are looking for a phone with strong battery back up with limited budget? Go for it... Otherwise you'll disappointed."
Was not expecting this.....,3.0,"What would you expect witha battery of the size 5000, that it should be great. Well it okay not that great.I think due to the size of the battery the phone feels quite heavy.Camera: let me say this bluntly that the camera is not great it okiesh time. Didn't expect this from the Samsung company.I know the prize is less but didn't expect the camera to be that bad.If you are going to buy it for battery performance then you may go for it."
Samsung's trust and Amazon's support is the only reason I bought this product,5.0,"First, Samsung's reliability and second, I ordered this product by combining them with so much emotion that even if I don't want to understand, then I will return it because I will definitely be heard here and when I ordered it, I understood that I have got a very good product and I am very satisfied with it, I gifted it to my brother, he used it regularly, there is no problem of any kind, you guys must also take it"
Damage product reshived,1.0,Damage product reshived hua hai or koi help nahi ki ja rahi haiअमेजॉन से प्रोडक्ट मंगाया था यह अभी तक 20 का कोई सर्विस नहीं हुआ है कोई नहीं पिकअप भी नहीं आर्डर पेंडिंग में और जो अमाउंट थी वह भी कट गया है 20 दिन हो चुके हैं पूरे
Incorrect information- Blocked for foreign sim cards.,3.0,The product detail mentions unlocked for all carriers but I cannot put a foreign sim card in this phone. It means that when I travel abroad I cannot use the local Sim card but need to use an Indian sim card and pay for roaming. It is an error in the description and not very happy about it.
Outstanding,5.0,Great product for the money. Thankfully it's not Chinese and there's peace of mind when using banking apps or other apps which warrants security of non Chinese servers. The camera to screen everything is as good it can get for the money and software is way above what the Chinese offers.
Waste of money. Not expecting from Samsung,1.0,"Dear all. I am writing this review very honestly, may other user get benefitted from this.I used this for 3 weeks and I would say it is clearly waste of your hard earn money .Pro.  Only batteryCons. 1.Heavy  and bulky2. Not adjustable in single hand for selfie4. Camera front. Worst quality all time grainy pic, no beautification5. Back camera also produce worst quality6. Processor is not much for heavy user7. Many time screen lag and hangDear it would be batter you purchase resume, dalne or opportunity in this price segment.If you use zoom app then go for snapdragon process over 700 it will be you option of virtual background in mobile . Media tek processor will not do much.I wnna to back this phone but window close by amazon and I purchased it's glass and guard and covers. So no option left. Pl don't buy this phone. Samsung create waste product in camera  In. This phone."
Only 2.4ghz band wifi is supported.,2.0,Except a single band Wifi rest all is fine. I see the product description doesn't say much about its wifi band support. It should have said that it supports only 2.4ghz band.I have no complaints about the others stuffs except that samsung should not bloat the software bundle with so many non essential packages that I can't uninstall.
Worst mobile,1.0,"The samsung and Amazon both fooled people.This is the first time I have tried to return a mobile and had worst experience with Amazon.Key Issues with mobile: Quickly device getting hot. Very much irritated during calls Battery drainage quicklyWorst Amazon support When I reached the CS support, they asked me to wait for a technical agent visit.  But the assigned technical agent left Amazon for more than year and I ended up co-ordinating with  CS support and that person.Again the next person avoided a personal visit and put me on a Minspect app and verified for few min. (Worst app at all and they promised for a personal visit but ended up on-call check)Again after a new call to the support team, they have agreed for a refund and asked me to update my pan card. But Again a new CS person refused that policy 🙄 🤔I don't know whether the intention of CS support is yo solve customer query or to time pass with us to feel irritated"
50-50 happy,4.0,"Maine ye cell 17 ko order diya aur 19 ko mujhe recive hua. 3days use karne ke baad mera review-Phone ka Camera aur battery super hai, screen size bhi pocket friendly hai, battery backups almost 2days.Mujhe isme kuch basic kamiyan lagi jo is prise range me nahi hona chahiye, jaise aap net ka speed screen me nahi dekh sakte kyunki setting me option hi nahi hai, isme net bhi slow chal raha hai. Speed show nahi hone se pata hi nahi chalta ki problem cell me hai ya sim network me. Mere likhane cell me idea 4g ka speed achha tha leki. Isme nahi hai. Overall mujhe bahut jyada khushi nahi hui is cell se, jabki maine Samsung ka naam dekh kar m12 purchase kiya. Please Samsung dhyan de."
Except for Battery Samsung M12 not worth its price,2.0,"Samsung M12 is not worth it's price due to various shortcomings faced by me. (1) FINGER PRINT SCANNER DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY Position of FP scanner on right side (unlike backside of phone in Samsung A21s & other models) fails FP Scanning. And if mobile has a backcover if the one recommended by Amazon at order stage, then FP scanner will fail you. (2) FACE RECOGNITION ALSO DOESN'T WORK Most of the time Samsung M12 doesn't recognize my face. (Looks it doesn't like my face with which no problem on Samsung A21s). (3) CONTACT PHOTO IN RECENT CALLS FEATURE REMOVED Recent calls appear without Contact Photo. With Recent Call feature in other models it was easier to search & Call numbers from Recent Calls List. (4) STORAGE 4.94 GB of Internal Storage & 7.13 GB of SD Card being shown as Used by OTHER details of which no where. No way available to scan this storage usage & remove unnecessary OTHER consuming Internal & SD Card Storage. (5) NOTIFICATIONS NOT APPEARING ON LOCK SCREEN Despite trying my best Notifications from various apps do not appear on Lock Screen. All settings, including of Lock Screen tried without any success. Think before finalizing Samsung M12."
Above average phone,5.0,Phone proformance is above average u can play normal graphic game without a glitch. The drawback of the phone is its too heavy and its display is not eye friendly you can't use the ph for hours ur eyes will pain. Front camera is poor at night time and rear camera is above good so if your budget is low as say 14K then go for it otherwise increase budget and buy other samsung phone. I will also resell it soon.
Good Budget phone if not best,4.0,"ProsExcellent Display for the price even if it is LCD (Samsung Expertise)Face ID with Fingerprint sensorOne UI is nice, smooth and feels modernUSB-C chargerLong Battery LifeConsPhone weights too high (more than 200 g)Samsung bloatwares are present and makes continued attemps to trick you for installation.Camera is fairly average, should have been little improved.No fast charging supportOverall good budget buy if you are looking for non Chinese budget smartphone."
Mediocre phone,3.0,It serves the basic purpose but advance features are lacking. Camera quality is too low and not as per given specifications of 48MP. Pixels spread up when you zoom in. Storage space is so low that you'll need atleast 64GB memory card. I'll suggest wait and gather money and have better smartphone than this.
WORST BUY FROM AMAZON,1.0,Bought SAMSUNG M12 after a lot of research from Amazon. Worst Experience I have after using 2 weeks. The phone is getting unresponsive and the buttons are not working. Contacted Amazon and Samsung Service Center. Samsung service center formatted my phone and I lost all my contents. I repeatedly told this may be a hardware problem but still they removed all my data and my phone is still in the same condition. Doesn't deserve this from Amazon and Samsung. I don't know what to do next.
Great budget phone 📱👌,5.0,In an affordable range this is a good phone to purchase. Loved the way it performes with its special features like 90hz display speed 6000mh battery and decent camera quality. If someone compares it with high budget phones and criticize then for them better to go expensive. Overall it's a great budget phone 📱..
Phone screen not working properly,1.0,I have received a beautiful phone but with screen hang problem. I have even used the 7 days replacement policy but the technician suggested me to go to service centre and update the phone but not replace the phone as they means supplier will send you old or used phone. I went to authorised service centre and upgraded the software but in vain.So never trust the technician not will buy a phone or electronic items from Amazon.
Very good at this price,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Very good, Don't dwell on the negetive review. Camera is pretty good, UI is very user friendly, Fingerprint sensor is at side on the lock screen button so no back side look is clean & the sensor works perfectly and flawlessly. Long battery life."
Good smart budget phone under 10000.,4.0,My review after receiving mobile..Dont think that samsung phones are hang every time.. the thing is how you dealing with the phone is matters with any brand...Rear/ selfi Camera - awesome performance (daylight conditon) 4.5/5Battery - 4/5Display- 4/5And unexpected features comes within it in this price range bcz it comes with android 11 latest version...90hz refresh rate👍working good.Side fingureprint sensor - fastIt support dual volte network...Awesome productThank you samsung for this monster reloaded smart phone...Don't worry guys go for it...
Best in this range,4.0,I have used this for a week now.So here is the detailed reviewPros1. Good battery life3. Fast processing4. Nice sound5. Good fingerprint  scannersCons :1. Average display(video quality sucks)2. Big on hand3. Screen is very soft it will break in a 2-3 fall4.Average camera.Go for m21 2021 edition for better camera.M12 quad can camera is if no use
Samsung No way,1.0,Very very poor customer service though my handset was under warranty screen cracked by itself within 4 months.But no way my screen was replaced. Asking for 40% cost of the handsetNot worth as Samsung screen is very delicate.
overall normal phone,3.0,"I didn't want to write a review because it was ot of stock for a long time and I thought this phone will never be back again. But as now they're giving huge offer I thought I should share my experience. This phone is a plan to capture people seeking ""good"" phone in low budget. Don't be mislead by the ads or offers.Display- you were using amoled display this display will be frustrating. But it is actually good kind of IPS Display. At daytime outside it is hard to use without full brightness.Battery- Not so fast charging. It takes 4 and half hours to charge fully. but Battery initially changes in 10 minutes upto 25% then slows down charging speed and battery life is awesome. you can go 3 days with full charge And morning to afternoon with 25%.processor- slow processor. forget games it is too slow.camera- front camera is junk, hazy. But rear camera is good. with no auto focus.no heating issue.overall good phone for those who doesn't use phone too much, needs for normal calls, whatsapp, payment etc. can buy it."
Phone is good for mid level range,4.0,Overall phone is ok. I have 6GB and 128 GB variant.Some advantages are there.1. In this Price getting good phone.2. Till now no heat or not hang.3. Till now Battery backup is good.4.  Video quality is also good.5. Good processor.Some drawback is there.1. Data cable is so small.2.  When charging no notification light is showing. When charge is full you have to check manually.3. Camera is not to the up yo mark like true 48MP.4. No notification light is there for missed call or anything.5. No Return policy is there.
Screenshot,4.0,Cannot get screenshot. Pressing the two keys does not help. Internet says that I can activate the side of palm movement but which option is not shown in Settings- Advance feature. Lacked pre installed Bluetooth and some other features which is available in a Xiaomi phone. But main issue is the screenshot
Big name & Feature but not worth to Buy,1.0,"I brought initially and that's mistake made,Pros - Good Display & Memory and even body built-upCons -Very Poor Camera , did not expect thatPhone getting heated while charging and UsePoor performance in spite of huge RAM and  projected  high end CPUI Also brought M02s , which was quite good and no issues at all but this one is highly disappointmentchecking if replace or return possible."
Alright smartphone,3.0,Have used this for 3-4 month's. Camera is very poor. Also this phone response is slow when you open multiple apps. Sound is okay but not like some other phones out there who provide better sound quality. Even though it is Samsung Mobile which is a big brand name but in M12 they have not done a good job as I had expected.
Not worth the money.,3.0,"Been using this device as a secondary phone for my office purpose. Camera is not good, comes with bloatware every time there is an security update the bloatware apps are reinstalled again, have to delete them again and again.Performance is disappointing, the phone is slow.Display is Ok but there is a noticeable light leak from below panel visible on screen.Device is very heavy, thick and long in length making it hard to use with single hand.I am using it as secondary device, I only use for office apps like MS Teams, Outlook with office admin portal app which gives my company complete root access to device so I am using it only for office communication purpose and I am glad it’s not my primary device.Save your money go for other device not this one. I would not even recommend this to gift to elderly as this is heavy thick and slow phone."
Good phone,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I use this phone last 3 days.I happy last 3 days camera quality is good ,battery  life is good ,built quality  is awesome.This price point  value  for  money.One point company not providing, back cover, screen guardsOver all 10 out of 8"
Good buy,4.0,Recently I have purchased this mobile device.it is working as expected with all the given features.It is an medium budget phone for some extract features.
Good Phone but performance is not smooth,3.0,I liked the phone battery last long even I tool 6GB ram version but the phone is little sluggish in performance may be the chipset is not great in performing daily task. But one UI is great even 120 he refresh rate I found phone performance not upto my expectations while comparing to my old redmi phone but I liked that unnecessary apps are not getting installed like redmi. Camera is great and battery life is awesome.
I am very unhappy with this mobile due to some technical issue,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Hi issue regarding networking in galaxy m12 this is very disgusting with the new product today 21st i open the box and try to connect wifi it isnot connecting it is showing like  “wifi connected but without internet” i tried all options like reboot, reset all settings , reset network settings and what else everthing i tried lastly i tried to contact samsungs support they said same what i did like reboot reset and finally they requested me to visit samsung store on tommorow  22nd at hyderabad kphb, if samsung center says there is technical issue, then i want a replace with another mobile galaxy m12 after trying all sorts of trouble shooting i messaged on amazon support you can find pic and video uploaded and i am expecting a swift reply on thisThank you"
It's very Worthy with lovely battery backup,4.0,"It's very worthy within a good range. It's Battery backup is good, camera quality is also good. finger print sensor is good but face lock sensor does not work properly all time. Overall it's a very good product from Samsung India within a very good price range."
Don't fall for 90Hz on Budget,3.0,"This phone does it job, but don't fall for 90Hz,It's gimmick, higher refreshing screen are only good if phone works smooth. This Amazon app don't even work properly, while scrolling these apps stutter,And junk! It automatically downloads unnecessary apps and makes phone even slower.Please go by other smart phone in this range.And if you are reading this review in 2021, please never consider phones below 20k for this brand. Go but mi, moto, realme, OPPO, vivo, you will get what you want."
Worst phone ever used,1.0,It's the worst phone I have ever seen. The build quality is really poor. And speakers of the would will give you a night mare. We can't hear the phone even if it's in your pockets . Speakers are toooo low. I would definitely not recommen this phone. Instead opt for mi or anyother brand where you would get tons of features at this price. I feel regret buying this phone.
Worst phone don't throw your money,1.0,"Very heavy phone. Peculiar problem of Samsung phone always in hung state .if you want to use in outdoor in day time you can't see anything bon screen.  For screen shot you need to put an extra floating menu on screen which is very irritating. No compass app you can run on phone as it lacks the sensors. Friends don't buy it, Chinese phones are far far better than this. I also purchased it just to avoid Chinese phone and now I repaint it. Since sep 21 I am using it and this is worst phone I have ever had."
Good one at this price,3.0,"Samsung m12 gives smooth performance. Its 48 mp camera is good but the quality of image it captures is low quality.It has a long battery of 6000 mah. While charging phones heats up. But within a few minutes,it cools down.Overall it is a good phone in 11,000/-Update: 6 may 2021Now its one and half month is over and it has started to heat up  unecessary during charging.🙄Update : 4th July 2021The phone is not taking charging instead it is draining the battery. I does not expected this type of issue with #samsung."
Feasted by Amazon and he's customer service,1.0,"Amazon se pareshan ho chuka hu 16 January 22 se lekar ab tak (25/01/22) mere return kiye hue product ka amount refunded nhi kiya hai.  10 baar customer service ko call kiya wo sirf aur sirf date age badhaye ja rhe hai.  aur 25th jan ko bolte hai refund amount 2th feb ka return hoga.  pareshan ho chuka hu yaar inse aur phone itna faltu ke (camera quality bekar upar se over heating, sim kar dalne pe net work he nhi aa rha tha."
Brick! Not worthy,1.0,I just bought a brick!The phone is too heavy as brickSlow as snail.Camera quality is worstInterface seems oldPrice : avg.Amazon return policy won't allow you to return that is biggest disadvantage.I insist potential buyers to avoid going for such tempting offers on this device n go for MI /Realme for way better features n feel in this price segment.
Overall the best smartphone under 10k,5.0,"I know people might say that this smartphone isn't good enough or something but under 10k it is the best smartphone Exynos 850 is much better than unisoc or Helio g80 which comes in redmi or realme under 10k.. battery is stable and long lasting, UI is clean it does not have that much bloatwares as it's a core version of one UI.. Camera quality is average neither good nor bad(have included some samples), so if you want a smartphone and your budget is 10-11k then go for this one, even gaming performance is better than Redmi 10 Prime and Note 10T."
Best budget for this phone.,5.0,"I think mostly buy for this people no need heavy work like gaming, editing. For Business purpose this is the best phone and it's your choice1. Build Quality is good2. Finishing is good3. Fastest Fingerprint4. But camera quality is low according to price5. Mostly you buyexpensive phone purchase samsung company6. Little bit hang in BGMI"
New to exynos chipset..but experience is fantastic,4.0,"Iam not a gaming user...so first of all this review is only for normal users...1.Very importantly  the battery stands so strong from its competitors.2.Display though lcd HD+, is so good from all viewing angles.3. I just love the side mounted fingerprint and power button but may be difficult  for some new smartphone users4.camera though  not great, at this price point it stands stronger than  its competitors with all four cameras5.colour variants of phone can be even more optional for users (as of now only three courses two usual colors and one slightly different colors.6.speaker is usual loud but not so great since it's competitors atleast gives surround speakers at this price point. But clarity of sound is great,but bass lovers wouldn't  love these speakers.7.Actually the expectation  and reality  of Samsung  exynos processor  changed my opinion  on their processor...it was great 👍...u will definitely  love it...8. One UI stands apart from all its competitors(especially mi ui ads on mi phones)It was my own experience and review with the phone...If iam wrong at any points peoples can comment me with correct ones so that users buy a better smartphone...Tq"
CAUTION : Does not connect to Wi-Fi 5G,2.0,This model's Wi-fi connects only with 2_4G. I get max download speed of around 15 to 25Mbps with my Tataplay fiber 200 Mbps broadband connection. Tata play technician who visited to help me expressed his helplessness as the problem is with M12 model. My other devices like a 9 year old iPad mini connect to Wi-Fi 5G.
Good budget phone!!,5.0,"Been using this phone for Last couple of months.Reception is good.Camera is average at wide angle, good at close range.Battery is awesome with over 3 days standby.Weight is little heavy.Performance is questionable on heavy apps.Overall a good budget phone with all features."
SELLER CHEATED. GAVE ME THE PHONE WITH REPLACED DISPLAY AND MOTHERBOARD,1.0,"Being a lay man, I don't understand if the mobile has re-pasted display. I believed the phone is as original as purchased from the samsung store and started using it.For the first 4 months everything was working fine and all of a sudden one day, the display was turning on and off on its own. And the next day display died.I contacted the Samsung original service center and they said that PHONE's DISPLAY and PBA have been replaced somewhere outside.I am attaching the Samsung's copy stating the Defect Description.Will also lodge an FIR against the Seller if not received the new phone in return.Don't worry for a Mobile worth 8,000.. I am Manic enough to spend 16,000 to teach a lesson to the seller."
Worth Price,4.0,"(Review it after using for a month)It's battery backup is quite impressive, camera is good but could be more simpler interface, I am not a gaming person but as per my Experience it's working smooth, but yes sometimes for a sec you will it might be slow but overall it's a worth Price product as of now."
Unsafe and not a privacy free and a laggy phone,5.0,"I also bought m32 5g model Samsung phone. In all samsung I noticed that location turns ON automatically while we switched to wifi which feels unsafe and also while in driving and walking, drive mode turns ON which blocks all calls sometimes important calls too. Cannot be able to disable both the modes.Also phone lags for every screen."
"Waste of money, Poor battery performance",1.0,"- Phone becomes hot on using for 10 minutes- Poor battery performance, in around 8-10 minutes 1% of battery is consumed while browsing some app (no music or videos were played)- Phone is thick and heavy to hold and it brings pain in fingers and hand (this cannot be blamed as weight is already mentioned in case description)- Never expected such product from Samsung"
Sorry Don't buy,1.0,"First time i am faced the problem online purchase, after 10 Days mobile display nit working, the acko insurance party not collecting, he told go to service center and  repair it we can reimbursing the invoice amount, but when i am going to add bank details these is A difficulty in IFSC Code. Till today my mobile not ready and not possible to online Update,"
NOT 5G COMPATIBLE,4.0,"It was not clear that the M12 is not G5 compatible. I bought it thinking it was. On April 6, is when I realized my MISTAKE, APRIL 2, being last return date. I shall appreciate if delayed return is acceptable and I am allowed to buy a 5G compatible Samsung Mobile.I cannot rate it on various parameters as I haven't used it. But as it is compulsory to enter the RATING, I PUT 4☆."
Samsung Is Hurting their fans Nowadays,1.0,"I am big samsung fan but nowadays samsung making the phones which are not capable for compete with other phones in this price range and mid range. WIFI 5 is not here , they can give only amoled screen , nowadays amoled is normal. Camera is not good but it's ok for this price range. Only battery life is good. Giving preloaded apps which are uninstallable. Buy in your own choice if you can add 1-1.5k more then go for other company phones coz nowadays these samsung phones getting hang problem  6 months later, I had m20 which had the same problem"
Great phone in a budget range.,5.0,"The phone works rather smoothly has a decent battery life where it lasts the entire day with the charge being at 47% by midnight. The camera performs well for the price, except the camera quality in the dark is grainy, and could be better. There is a weight to it which adds to the build of the phone. There is one speaker grill on the right side of the phone and has excellent audio. Would recommend 10/10"
DONT BUY IT,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 IT HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED TWO MONTHS SINCE I BOUGHT SAMSUNG GALAXY M12 FROM AMAZON. IT STATED HUNG AND REBOOT EVERY 5 MIN FOR 4 DAYS. WORST PRODUCT SINCE I USED MOBILE PHONES."
Not As Good As Advertised,2.0,"- My contact book is not too large, around 700 contacts, yet it takes a couple of seconds to load it. It didn't happen in my previous mobiles even though they were less powerful than this device.- Although it has 4 cameras at the back, the portrait mode is completely nonsense. My previous phone had only 2 cameras on back yet it's portrait mode was a thousand times better.- Fingerprint sensor is on the power button and a real pain to use when you have a mobile cover."
"Battery, Touch, Display and Camera",4.0,"Writing this review after using this for complete 1 month..1-🔋 Life really good I can say it's awesome which lasts long for complete more thn a day watching videos/movies, playing games, connected to WiFi and Bluetooth all day long..2- Display is big enough to enjoy watching videos/ movies, playing games same as Sony Xperia's lates variants Sony Xperia 1 ii, 1 iii, 10 ii, 10 iii and all which is 21:9 cinematic view3- Touch is also very good it's very smooth and an actual feel of 120 refreshing HZs..4- Though it comes with quad camera 48, 5, 5 and 2 MP it's not up to the mark, camera quality is very poor as compared to other phones which comes under 15K."
Avrage mid range phone📱,4.0,"I would say seller needs to do work with packaging 📦 and. phone delivered to me in good condition but over all its goodAbout phone it is a mid range phone if you are avrage phone user so it is good choice for you 1.Camera is ok 2.Phone performance is ok according to this price 3.Build quality is ok its fully plastic material 4.about display do not expact supper hd displays its ok not so good not so badMy opinion if are buying this for kid, mom , dad ,go for it"
"No dual band wifi, only 2.5ghz, very much disappointed",2.0,"What benefit we will get if I have 6gb or 8gb ram. How come this mobile will not provide dual band wifi, means I am getting low Internet speed with that single band wifi feature. Very much disappointed with this big drawback. Even lower price mobiles are giving this feature but not m12. Samsung smartly avoided by not mentioning this in the product description."
Writing this post after using the phone for one week,5.0,"Camera quality is awesome, no compromise on the quality.Battery life is excellent, for my usage of approx 20 nos long call of 5 - 20 mins average, and corporate emails.... Usage the battery is lasting for almost 3 full days. Battery is seriously a Monster.Fingerprint reader is an average one... No comments!!!  Overall for the price of 10k (i got 2k discount from amazon and 1k for using icici card) this is an excellent product from Samsung. Also to mention the Android v11 is loaded... No compromise in security related flaws. Excellent phone... Go for it!!!!!"
Worst phone.. and in top of that pathetic Amazon support service,1.0,Worst phone.. and in top of that pathetic Amazon support service . Had ordered the phone twice but wifi not working in both the phones.. above of all that Amazon tech team service is worst.. while returning/ exchange of defective item amazon will tell the follow this that process. It took us alost a month to get our refund
Budget Friendly phone by samsung,4.0,"My earlier m31s stopped working suddenly, and in order to have a backup during lockdown purchased this one. It is budget friendly if bought in sale. Same as other phones in size (which are being launched lately). speed and memory in sync. However, camera and finger print scanner a big turn off. Dont go for it if camera / pics are main purpose or you use that often."
Worst Mobile,2.0,Seems like Im using 10 years back mobile. Its super heavy. Resolution is no good and I have eye pain. Camera is very bad. Yes they have given 6000 mah battery but it takes more than 2 hours to charge fully. And battery does not work like a 6k mah battery.Does not expect this from Samsung as they have huge market nowadays compare to Apple worldwide.
screen replacement issue's solution,4.0,"6 months screen replacement for prime means, third party is providing replacement for prime members only within a certain prime day offer period.In case anyone want replacement, have to contact or raise a request through for replacement. Third party will do the needful accordingly."
Couldn't meet my expectations,3.0,"I expected a lot about samsung mobiles in this price segment, but after buying it I totally regret myself.. But as a reviewer, I would like to post the pros and cons that I observed in this mobile..Pros:-1. Long Battery Life.2. Advanced features which are only available in Samsung ecosystem (like ""do not disturb while in driving"" etc.,)3. Can fastly unlock the phone using Fingerprint scanner.Cons:-1. Total Weight of Mobile.2. Camera quality is not seems like a 48MP Cam.3. Display quality is also not good.4. Face unlock is just an useless feature in this mobile.5. Last but not least, the worst thing is the processor. A walking turtle would be better than the performance speed of this processor..If anybody like to buy a mobile in this price range, just go with either Redmi or Realme.. Those brands will really satisfy you a lot (I were a Redmi user and I fully satisfied with the features, that's why I recommended this brand). 👍"
Worst processor ever in a Samsung phone !!,1.0,"I bought this smartphone for my mother as I knew there would be no large applications used, so the phone would not need much processing. But this phone started to freeze and lag even when applications of size 10 -15 MB were installed. I have been a loyal Samsung customer for nearly 10 years, but now it's time to move on I think.I will not suggest this phone to anyone. You can get far better phones at this same cost."
Hanging issue and Lags a lot ...,1.0,Now I understand why they are offering 6 / 128 GB in these rates...I was using Samsung A9 2018 with the same configuration and I thought that it's time to change my mobile so I bought this Samsung m 12 and you won't even believe within a four days I claim for return and I ordered oneplus mobileI am also a Samsung user but after using this Samsung M12 I am really disappoint
Touch not responsive gotbstruck on setup screen .Didn't expected this thing from Samsung India.,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Got struck on the setup screen due to touch is less responsive . Amazon  seller had delivered a malfuncted phone to me.Disappointed by Amazon atleast you should do quality check for the product your selling. Complete waste of time and waste of money.If there is option for negative star I will definitely give that also.Disappointed"
A short review........,5.0,"This mobile has got excellent battery backup it's a beast.The display is also best 👍.The camera is ok-ok quality i.e Average quality as if u zoom a little the pixel decreases.The face regonization is very bad it doesn't work at all, you have to move ur face to 1-2 cm distance from Phone than only it works.No complain regarding fingerprint, it's works smoothly 😌.The sound through the speakers are quality sounds 👌.Overall except the face regonization this mobile is perfect👍.I gifted this mobile to my maa and she is happy with it 😊. Mobile at cost of  only ₹9999 is perfect for me 👌."
DOES NOT SUPPORT 5GHz WiFi BANDS,4.0,"Such an awesome phone ruined by a biggest lack of a most important and basic feature, GREAT battery life, camera, UI, lives up to its reputation;Great specs all round, only thing to be vary of is that it DOES NOT SUPPORT 5GHz band wifi “5G wifi”When you buy a phone with such great specs, it’s a real shame that the only thing slowing it down is a lack of fast internet speeds due to hardware limitation. Not having support for 5GHz in 2021 is 🤮🤮"
Below Average phone,2.0,Below average phone.Heavy in weight.I missed to note it's not a dual band wifi supports only 2.4Ghz.Camera is just average 48 MP is just for a sake .Phone is slow no doubt about it.Sound just below average.I will suggest if u have couple of thousands budget go for other brands.

Just ok for a budget phone not made in china,3.0,"Purchased in June.What I like-Battery power. I charge it only once in 2 days. Being a medium-to- heavy user  it's a big thumbs up.- Storage capacity- Navigation speed- Not made in ChinaWhat I dislike- It's quite heavy!- Eyes hurt within 3 hours. It never happened with any of the phones I have  used so far (more than 10 phones ) . Some of them were really cheap too. I  don't know why this phone makes the eyes hurt. I am not a particular fan of  Eye Comfort Shield feature so this is a big minus point for me.- Camera here truly is just an accessory. Well, anyway, I didn't buy this phone  for cameras, my expectations were already low but the quality of pics are  even lower than what I expected.- Screen resolution.If you have other phones and want a budget secondary phone not made in China this one is good enough. I was sceptical about the performance of an Exynos processor , never used one before, but it seems alright so far."
The worst phone i ever met.,3.0,"Battery quality is beyond my expectations .It drains too quickly and when I got the phone only 47% charged shows that samsung company is not aware about his customers.There is no features of screen recording and object remover in this phone i have to install app from playstore.Hardly a week passsed of brought this phone it started hanging and heating + Poor touch response after i put temper on the screen .Overall i suggest you guys please go for another phone in this range samsung is worst .You can prefer vivo ,realme at this range will be better than this one."
Not worth. Very slow phone. Waste of money. Do not Buy,2.0,As a phone just bought and from Samsung it was a complete let down. Phone is very slow without any App itself. Installing an app itself takes ages. Screen resolution is pathetic and so is the Look of the phone. Very very disappointed!!!!! Anyway thanks to Amazon that somehow managed to return it.
Affordable Phone with Great Features,4.0,"Beyond expectations, an affordable phone in this budget with great features loaded. This phone has the latest android 11 with a great camera, very good battery life, Exynos processor, IPS display with 90Hz, and is well built. This phone is easy to use for gaming and has a lot of memory to store all your media files and documents. Timely delivered and thanks to Amazon for such fast delivery."
6 MONTH SCREEN REPLACEMENT,1.0,I HAVE PURCHASE WITH PRIME AND GET 6 MONTH FREE REPLACEMENTTHERE IS NO OPTION TO APPLY ITPHONE SCREEN BREAK BEFORE 1 WEEK BUT I AM UNABLE TO APPLY AND NOW IT IS 6 MONTH OVER SO WHAT I NEED TO DO I DONT KNOWTHERE IS NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT SYSTEM IN AMAZON
Worst mobile I have ever  seen,1.0,"I brought this phone for my dad.everything was good at first but after some 4 months the phone is not at all working.when I reach to Samsung service center they are telling like ""the motherboard is not working if I go for service also its waste of money"".but there is no physical damage from our end not understanding wt the hell going on.and still 2 months emi is pending for this and they r not taking this for exchange also....and also I have brought Samsung m32 at the same time...that also not working properly nowadays...its always hang. So finally my suggestion is not to go for  Samsung products."
Don't expect much. Just a basic low end smartphone and does justice for this price,2.0,"For this price - Nothing great to be expected.It's a low end phone. So everything about this phone is below average - except battery.Bad ambient light sensor, decent camera, decent amount output, cheap charging cables - bad quality.Excellent battery!Expensive phones - outstanding performanceCheap phones - you get what you pay for"
Value for money,4.0,"It's been good so far..and for sure value for money...good battery almost coming 3+days, nice UI, touch is good, decent camera, browsing speed is good...Issues..Some times app gets closed automatically, when u try to open...esp youtube, google maps...might required Some system updates"
No support from Seller,1.0,"Had a mix up Galaxy M21 with M12 . Both comes next to next when you search for M21 . The price of the 6 GB varient of m12 and 4 GB of m21 is also the same . Only problem is M21 is Super amoled , Full HD with latest processor .  No comparison with both . Realized this only on unboxing when the screen looked very ordinary on running the phone .The lag to move from one function to the next is glaring ( even when it is brand new ). Reported this to amazon . They could not help as the seller support page is just a computer generated one which just runs you in circles . Basically no way to contact seller. Only a postal address - in todays world how is it even going to work?  Tried seller website .No reply . I was more than willing to Pay more since it was partly my mistake . Feel cheated with price of a decent phone which starts off slower than my 4 yr old current phone . If only the seller could help ."
All featured Samsung smart phone In this budget .... Pocket friendly,5.0,"It's budget phn with all facilities plus Samsung brand... It's a good choice... You can buy it without doubt if you want a good battery life,  good picture quality,  good camera, also its not lagging in game, good processor and ram with no overheating issue... In this budget it's the best budget and pocket friendly phone. You can't expect more in this budget"
Non slippery Surface👉👉,2.0,"👂Do not waist your money on this mobile..👍Mobile is good as secondary usage, non slippery surface is the only good thing.👍You can change video quality in apps like u-tube, Amazon prime etc.👎Worst display👎Camera, display and touch quality not good👎Heavy weight 220gmNote✍️Go for another mobile with latest configuration."
This is the second time I have faced an issue with the Amazon on buying a electronic product.,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The phone is hanging and goes off on its own. Not even a week the phone was used and started giving problem, video attached for your reference....Due to lock down I was not able to return the phone as the site was not functional and gave me an error currently we cannot pickup or drop any product at your mailing address due to covid-19 restrictions...."
It's battery lasts for 48 hours,5.0,Pros:Great Battery which lasts for more than 24 hours even if i watch Amazon Prime for whole dayBig displayGreat cameraDual VoLTEDual VoFI (Normal calling through broadband internet)Cons:Compass is not thereAbsence of GyroscopeIt has some good weight (222 gm to be specifically)Overall its a good phone for the people who don't play games like Pubg or CODM. In my case I needed a phone with great battery and it works perfectly for me.
"Not Good, Not Bad",3.0,"Hey so this is an honest review from my side. I thought Samsung phone would be great for my dad but it isn't so great. The battery life isn't good. Once the battery goes below 50% it drains really fast. Talking about camera quality, it isn't as good as expected. The pictures look grainy.. finger print reader doesn't accepts your finger sometimes, and if you put a cover on your phone then its even harder to use the finger print reader. This phone has good features but ya if I talk about the price it was good for 11k but not perfect!"
"Battery backup very good,",5.0,"Battery backup very good. Some features are very helpful, that is tap to wake up & screen off, eye comfort shield, dark mode, Dolby atmos. Transfer massages, contacts, settings, notes, app data are very easy from my old Samsung phone. Overall experience very good."
Worth buying,5.0,"Battery is good, though it takes almost 2-2.5 hours for recharge.. camera quality is good. 128 gb rom and 6gb ram is good for any application even for big sized games..Only shortcoming is the fingerprint sensitivity.. its particularly bad mainly because of its position on the side..But all total its a phone worth buying in this price range"
"If you got few extra 1000s, go with upper models",3.0,"Giving 3 stars because1 - It only have got 2.4 ghz wifi card, 5 ghz wifi will not work on this. So if you have modern day fiber internet wifi, chances are it won't probably be compatible with this device.2 - It says 48MP camara but it is not the best camara regarding the specs. I don't understand why it got 4 camaras when other 3 are barley average in terms of quality.If you can have few extra thousands, then go with m30s series.I understand Samsung has to do stuff to do cost cutting and marketing, I also own a m31, that one is better. Also random apps will download from samsung app store until you dont force stop samsung app store."
Review depends on beholder,4.0,"1. Price - Bought during GIF, was one of the cheapest in this config range.2. Camera - Average at best.3. Battery life - Very good.4. Sensors for touch - Good.5. Batteries are heavy and the mob as such is heavy in hand, don't keep them in loose pockets!!6. Browsing - Good, remove all unnecessary apps during first opening and setting up the device.Overall a good device if purchased within 9k."
Very poor performance compared to specifications,3.0,Fingerprint sensor often doesn't respond. Without any reason phone goes in deep sleep mode and go for 3-5 cycle of restarting automatically then start working. Updates are available but not getting installed properly.Called service centers several times but no response received. It appears a faulty product.Camera appears good but if you compare the quality of pic with other models of Samsung it's quality is very average.
No after sales service,1.0,"Charger stopped working after 2 months of use. Local Samsung service center denied to repair or replace it since it is purchased through amazon.. So many emails written to Samsung customer care, they always reply with same answer "" our executive will reach out to you shortly"". But They never do. Shocked with this kind of support samsung is providing."
Perfect budget phone for non gamers,4.0,"Fingerprint reader is really good and quickBattery life is good tooCamera quality is decent, since I m not much into photography I am goodProcessor isn't powerful enough to run heavy games , but it don't play heavy games, so this mobile is perfect for meAbsence of secure folder is kinda heartbreaking but nothing that we can't manage"
Great Phone!,4.0,"Pros:*On the internet, some found the phone heavy a little bit, but for me, it looked like a sturdy mobile*Great Rear camera quality, Good front camera quality*Ultra quick fingerprint sensor*Descent battery life indeed, suggest you use the phone mildly and charge the battery only up to 85-95% for at least 1 week. I use the phone mostly for YouTube and social media and with that using its battery last for about 2.5 - 3 days or sometimes 3.5 days as wellCons:*Face Recognition is slow, but you won't need that if you use fingerprint*Not meant for high-end gaming cause sometimes frame dropsBtw purchased the phone for Rs 9499"
"A very poor quality camera, memory",1.0,"Firstly amazon cc is very inefficient in handling my queries, series of wrong communication from chat support, phone support. My email is not yet answered since 8 days. Now, samsung m12 phone - out of 64gb only 50-52gb is available and remaining 12-13gb occupied by system. Out of 4gb ram 1.8gb approx is occupied by system. Camera quality is very very poor. Phone hangs too much like if i unlock the phone it takes more than 10-15 sec to display clock, navigation icons, notifications panel etc. Phone heats up if we use gdrive, maps, hotspot. Screen and body is very delicate. Plz think much before you go for this. An upset frustrated Amazon cusromer, Sameer!"
Average,2.0,"I had a lot of doubts before purchase on seeing the negative reviews lying here and there but my experience with the Samsung m12 was really exciting. It has good battery backup, the display, even though 720p is not bad to look at, screen brightness is optimum. RAM management is good for day to day apps. Haven't found any lags.  Haven't tried playing any games on it. The battery last for 2 days on normal usage and 1 day on heavy usage and takes about 3hrs to fully charge.  Over all it is a great phone. The true monster. Update: After using it for nearly 6 months I'm facing proximity sensor issue, which I found is common in midrange samsung devices because of which I'm planning to change the phone and never am I going for another Samsung device. There are minor stutters here and there even while using light apps like YouTube. The battery life is still awesome."
Not so great. Regret my purchase,2.0,I bought this for my mother. I ll just list what I don't like.1. Too heavy. Don't buy this for old people2. Camera is shaky and output is not great. I don't know why they have given four cameras.3. Too much of useless Samsung apps and galaxy items interrupting in between. I cannot able to disable these.
Processing speed  very  slow and internet  working is very bad.,1.0,Battery life is so good  and camera quality  is average  like 13 mp. Front camera is like 2 mp. Fingerprint reader working without touch finger. When we hold in hand then finger  print reader trust to read any part of hand so it was problem. Processing system is very low. And in this mobile internet speed very slow. And in low network  it's  internet  not worked. Only show processing.
"Awesome battery life, satisfactory screen",5.0,"For my use case, a single charge lasts me around 6 days (charge 100% to 40%, after which I recharge again). Actually it should last me more than 10 days I think, if I allow it to drop to 1% before recharging. My use case is: office related video calls, email, WhatsApp, online shopping, connecting to chrome cast and watching YouTube videos on tv, sms, phone calls, reading kindle books, etc. Screen ON time, about an hour or so a day depending on video call duration. I do not play games on my phone. I keep it on battery saving mode, and 60hz screen refresh.Been using the phone for more than a month now. Very satisfied with the performance. Only slight issue was the slightly heavier weight of the phone compared to my previous phone. But I have gotten used to it and it does not bother me at all now.Regarding the screen being non fullHD, I thought it would be something I would notice. Nope, I feel no difference when reading books on kindle. Maybe teenagers with better eyesight will notice, but I definitely cannot.In summary, I’m very happy with the purchase. I just hope Samsung keeps pushing the updates till at least android 13, and security updates for at least 4 years. That would be perfect."
User friendly Indian phone,5.0,"Overall a very good performance phone with good call quality, speaker quality, screen quality, battery life, handling, ergonomic & feature full. The only drawback I faced is that the head phone connector is placed at the bottom of the phone which prevents me from keeping it in standing position on my phone stand. It should have been on the top side like my old Lenovo phone. Otherwise, overall it's a 5 star from side. Samsung, please consider this feedback if it reaches you."
Think twice  before buying,3.0,"I am using this phone from past 3 months and I never played any heavy games in this phone. I use it to attend calls and social media, watching videos,  listening music and for clicking pictures.I'm using Vodafone and jio Sim & I'm facing issue with Vodafone signal, whenever I'll get call it use to disconnect in-between.Camera performance is not bad, but I'm not happy with battery performance.  It has a 6000mAh battery but I have to charge my phone everyday it consume lot of battery.And phone is little heavy you have to buy additional cover and screen protector.Only charger and type c cable is available along"
Samsung display issues,1.0,Within 45 days display damaged. It's in warranty but asking 3000. Worst decison for buying samsung. I would never again buy samsung phones and will never prefer anyone for the same. I am using another phone of redmi from 5 years no issues as of now. Withing 45 days it's damaged and no warranty on the display too...I am very unhappy with Samsung services. Bad product and customer service too.
Decent device,3.0,"Overall, it's a decent device. In one year time however the performance has come down in terms of response. The biggest problem I faced was the loose connection of the finger print module. One fall the finger print cable+power button cable would disconnect from the module and then its a headache to open the backpanel and fix it. My mother's realme c11 was much more sturdier and a better performer even now (bought at the same time). Buy it only if you need a Samsung branded phone."
A good battery life phone with Average camera,4.0,The phone is no doubt a good choice at a given price point. Along with the trust of Samsung brand. The camera quality is average but you will surely not be disappointed considering the price that you have paid.The best part is its 6000mAh large battery. It goes on and on.The only con that I feel is that it is bit bulky but that too is mangeable.Attaching few clicks for those who are wondering about the camera quality.
whatsapp is not compatible and camera is low quality,3.0,"I have faced at least 2 bugs while using this phone in whatsapp,1. after capturing image send button was not available on the screen2. I was not able to send messages to anyone while my other apps were working fine which uses internet connectionsamsung and whatsapp developer please look into thiscamera quality is average or near to poor"
Mobile hang frequently,2.0,It was very happy when I received it that I haven't spent money on China mobile but within 10 day I started regretting as it has started to hang very frequently and that's annoying. I haven't added extra memory card and using phone with only one SIM. Return policy was 7 days and it started hanging from 9th day :(
Average or below average,3.0,Camera  :  Not Good (not up to mark  48 mp)Battery  :  GoodDisplay  :  Not good (like local )Charger with phoneNo back cover with phoneNo ear phone with phoneMany  problem  with phone  you  can say poor quality  of  product o r  below average Mon youtube and  others  they  are  making foolish  about  phone review
Delivers at its price - Highly Recommended.,5.0,"Bought this for my parents and they love it. As I am using A52 myself, I feel M12 delivers at its price range and then some. The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate. Having 90 Hz Adaptive display is wonderful.Camera is decent as well, with options for Macro (attached) and Wide Angle being good as well. Haven't experienced any lags on medium workloads.Android 11 with updated UI, Smart View, Dolby Atmos, Good Battery Life are some highlights.Very satisfied with the purchase."
Pro and cons,3.0,"Don't expect high from this phone its  camera not good, gaming you can do at low settings and medium on high settings it gonna heat up and this improve network connection sometimes you don't get signal in basements of jio vi airtel but in this i got network in basement to and display is avg battery is perform normal as usual on dual sim it give 10hr battery backup performance on donig basic is good 90hz pannel is doing a great job just a single app got open in sec and its a metal body so after few days without cover you can see scratch on back pannel"
It is good! But not tooo good! As i expected!,4.0,I am reviewing this after 2 months of usage! It was good ! It is little heavy compared to other samsung mobile! The battery life is good... But not as worth for 6000mah! I don't play games i just use social media! For social media useage its bit Oke! And the camera! Seriously! 48mp is not that good its Oke! Just oke!! But its totally budget friendly!
Best mobile by samsung 👌,5.0,"Best low Price galaxy ever.Camera is best for outdoor and day not for Night, mobile working smoothly 👌,All is fine disappointments about USB Cable, About screen  YouTube run on 1080pxAnd pubg on HD resolution, no hitting problems at all. I order two m12 mobile blue and white, white  is good looking, 6000mhz massive  battery backup, I Loved it. Thank 😊 you samsung."
Screen brightness flickers in low light while switching between apps,3.0,"1. Screen brightness flickers in low light while switching between apps. 2. It is not so super smooth though it is 90 hz.Everything else is good. 3. When we try to increase brightness via notification center, it just goes back to the lowest immediately and automatically though auto brightness is disabled in the display Settings"
Overall Nice Smartphone!,4.0,"Good Phone in this price segment and overall decent performance but camera is not really good as samsung showcase its true 48 megapixel ,even front camera quality not so good.Battery wise thumbs up!Charging time about 2- 2:30 hrs. 0-100, it will give you 1 day battery backup even after heavy usage.Dual 4G volte with dual standby.Screen quality preety good.It an heavy phone.For business purpose I recommend this phone.Overall 8/10."
VIDEO SYSTEM NOT WORKING AT ALL,1.0,"VIDEO CAN NOT TO BE SENT TO WHATS APP, EVEN 5/6 MINUTES OF VIDEO, ONLY ONE STILL PHOTO & OBLY 10 MINUTES VIDEO IN GALLARY SHOWING THAT THE STORAGE IS FULL ALSO SYSTEM IS NOT SUPPORTING TO SHOOT ANY VIDEO OR TAKE ANY PHOTO. SINE THE DAY WE HAVE  ACTIVATED PHONE ON 15TH dEC BY AIRTEL SIM, VERY RARELY USING PHONE AS VIDEO SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING AS PER OUR REQUIRMENTS. SO PLZ SUGGEST BEST SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM AS I PURCHASED THIS PHONE FOR VIDEO UPLOADING PURPOSE."
Think once before you choose to buy,3.0,"The phone has good battery better than most other phones.The performance is not upto the mark. Camera doesn’t look like 48 pixel.Writing 48 pixel camera, 6GB RAM and not experiencing such level of performance based on specs raises doubts on Samsung.Definitely compare with other phones in the before marking a purchase decision"
Worst mobile company  and worst handset ever,1.0,I bought samsung galaxy m12 6/128 on 20/10/2021. Since then on last month i have to change mobile motherboard mobile screen was not working properly and was hanging alot during calls it was difficult to talk in a single call i have to end the call and again call to same number same problem i was facing again and againWhile the mobile was in pocket it was automatically going into out of networkPower button was also got inactive. That was also repaired from service centre alot of issue faced after purchasing this handset.NEVER GO FOR ANY SAMSUNG SMART PHONE
Good budget phone,5.0,"This is a good budget mobile. If you are not power user and do not play game, this mobile can last upto 3 days on a single charge. It also has micro SD card slot , so you can expand the memory. Screen is nice and bright, big enough to watch videos. I have been using this phone for 3 weeks now and have not faced any problem"
"The features are good, but slightly hardware is heavy and OS is slow",4.0,"The features are good with a good display, but the OS is slow sometimes. The phone is heavy comparatively. The numeric keypad is not working properly for some of the frequently used apps such as GPay."
Recommended but think again!,5.0,The phone is great. Good display and UI. Comes with 6000 maH huge battery. Charging is quick but 1 thing that comes as negative is the camera. The camera doesn't seem like 48 MP. It struggles in low light & the Front camera also suffers the same problem. You can certainly go for it if you are OK with below standard camera. Amazon delivery was excellent
Value for money smartphone,5.0,"While Samsung boasts about the 48MP camera, the picture quality is not up to the mark. I was looking for a smartphone for my mother with a price range of 9-11 k and was confused between Resmi 9 series and Samsung M12. I finally decided to go for samsung since it has a good resale value. The battery life is just amazing, since my mom uses the phone for basic functions like calls, watching videos on youtube and social media, the battery lasts easily for 3 days on a full charge"
It's OK for non regular users.,2.0,"1. To begin with battery life is pretty good, however it takes little longer to fully charge the phone.2. Front came is pathetic. Rear camera is some how ok for basic usage.3. Fingerprint will work whenever it wants to (not everytime you need it) so remember phone pinlock to be on a safer side.4. Phone got hanged twice within 15 days of normal usage.5. Overall this is a phone for elderly person or for someone who is low to minimal user on a daily basis."
U cannot wish to satisfy everyone,5.0,I bought this phone to last 5years(thus OPPO or Vivo was not an option).........my first phone was Samsung metro.......now it's Samsung galaxy m12..........user interface is good.......the phone barely looses any charge when idle or used via wired earphones..........satisfied till now
beast under 12k,5.0,samsung m13 is budget king1)samsung never disappoints in software wise2)performance was good battery lasts for 2 days 50mp camera clicks very good3)side fingerprint was very quick and it unlocks even we realise it4)phone charges very quickly eventho it was 6000mah5)themes were good in android 12 with samsung one ui
"Good Phone, Does the job in this price range.",4.0,"I am using this phone for almost 4 months, Experience is good so far, Everything is decent in this price range,Main reason for me to purchase is because of battery, Which serve its purpose, But it made phone little heavy.Overall i am satisfy with the purchase."
Mobile quality is average,4.0,1) Look and feel of the mobile is good but little heavier due to 6000 mAH battery.2) Camera quality is good but slow - takes more time to save the picture.3) Fingerprint reader is good.4) Overall performance is slower.5) Battery support - 2 days under normal use.
Not Bad,4.0,"First time when i used, it saw heating alot. I was worried too much but later it was fine. One of the best quality is that it has an awesome battery backup. Camera is not up to what i thought. I faced bit sound issues for whatsapp and no gestures for screenshots. Still it seems fine, not bad choice."
A good phone for binge watching your favourite shows and scrolling through insta or facebook,3.0,"It is a good phone for the price (i got it for ₹9500). Have a very good battery backup ,display is good with 90hz refresh rate  (would have been better if it was FHD+) good main camera and decent wide angle camera rest two cameras are trash, front camera is also decent gets the job done, the processor is good for day to day usage and light gaming, not for heavy gamers and don't expect it to run BGMI at balanced settings the best it can do is low, software is good and ad free though it still runs android security patch of december 2021.Overall a good phone for parents or as a secondary phone.Edit:- got feb security patch update yesterday on 23-05-2022."
Best Phone in Budget,5.0,It's best budget phone for daily use purpose. Pls don't expect premium phone's level camera quality but it suffice whatever it has....The best thing is screen resolution when you go out in sun unlike cheap Chinese phones which gets fade..
Doesn't recognize 5G bandwidth of wifi,1.0,Such a modern phone but doesn't recognize 5G bandwidth of wifi. Fingerprint reader on lock button is in a very wrongfully place. Phone locks and unlocks because of it. So now have to register a different finger for unlocking and use different finger for locking the phone.

"Excellent camera, good battery and awesome fingerprint reader",5.0,"M12 is fulfilled my expectations completely, hats off to Samsung. Quality camera and fingerprint reader are best of this range. Especially big battery gives good support for online classes without interruption, totally we are well satisfied with product."
This one of the best budget phone,4.0,I bought this phone 6 months back. Battery life is the strong point of this phone apart from that big screen and white bright light also appealing.Camera quality is not that good but if you are looking a smart phone in this segment so you dont much expect from camera.All in all best phone in this segment a complete package.
Defective mobile Amazon selling don’t buy,1.0,"Defective mobile Amazon sellingCopy mobile Amazon giving please don’t buy.I bought 2 phone in offer price but both mobile is worst copy.,after complaint not response fromAmazon bad bad experience., Bad bad bad mobile is not good.copy product sending my money waste 2 mobile I bought but both mobile have battery charging problem 4 hours taking for charge.,even speaker problem and hearing problem on call volume of ring is slow.,phone is not good please don’t buy"
Most cost effective phone for a brand like Samsung,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The fingerprint reader is very sharp.The battery life is the best. It last for almost3 days with less use.The camera is great the macro camera isn't good but the 48 MP camera is the best it works very nicely. Jus the phone is a bit heavy. Otherwise good. The screen resolution is great."
Can go for better with addl 2k,3.0,"Good battery back up.Sound and picture could have been better at this price.Unable to make credit card payments through this phone, states version should be above 18.3.My prior phone was doing it bought 4 years ago.Within weeks timePhone at this cost hasLow camera qualityHanging issues unfortunateTechnician checked and advised for replacement. Agreed with issues.Don't see options to return, please stay away folks."
Don't like it.,1.0,Camera quality is very poor and display quality too. This model is not listed in the exchange models list also. How funny that Amazon sold a mobile and they aren't considering the same model for exchange what kind of business ethics is this where as the same model is listed on Flipakrt for exchange models.
Think🤔,3.0,"First of the phone was a worth purchaseand best budget promise by samsung.For a normal user epecially for middle aged one's and new android experiencing one's it is a better choise, why because of the branded non chinese mobile.Perfomance :1.Camera quality : primary camera is best and give awesome clicks but not impressed in secondary, but i repeat its a budget based handset by samsung..2.Finger print reader: take a few seconds some times, but in a wide range it is fast.3.Battery life : its awesome no word to say...And fast charging 15wA negative portion is weight, its weight is about 221 gm it's heavier i noted this here because, samsung introduced m21 model with more specifications and perfomance carrying the same monster typical battery 6000 mah but weighing only around188gm is very lite weight and easy to handle (remember the prize difference).Overall my conclusion is the product is worth for money. I am completely satisfied, why because i had that much money....So no over expectations, thank you samsung.And especially thankyou Amazon for best service again."
Bad bad bad phone,1.0,"I am writing review after using almost 1month of using this phone, so please take serious before buying this. There is no return policy only replacement available. So think twice.Please dont fall in offer, worst phone ever, always ask for software update.Heavy in weight.Camera Quality poor.Battery life poor.Sound Quality poor.Don't fall in rat race."
Bang for a Buck,5.0,"People who are judging this without realizing it's price needs to calm down. I bought this for my cousin during Great Indian Festival at Rs. 8600. Excellent product, Clean Samsung UI which is the best in the world, 90 Hz refresh rate which is working fine without any lag, Battery backup is real good. People who are saying camera needs improvement, they are not gonna give you Flagship level camera in the phone which is less than 10000 Rs. If you want cleaner UI, you can definitely buy this. & it's stupidity to judge a phone by Gaming performance. This phone is a daily driver & not a gaming device."

Don't buy this Phone 😞,1.0,1-Camera Quality too poor back & Front both2- battery life is too short 8 hours3- unable to take screenshots4-phone hang while typing5- for PUBG lover Don't Buy not working in properly6- Display Quality is so ugly while playing game 🎯🎮7- mobile heating while charging & using tym both8- It's taking 3-4 hours for charging
Speaker output is very low. Has bugs out of the box,4.0,Speaker output is low. You will notice this if you consume media using phone's speakerIt has a bug in touch screen out of the box. Gets fixed with first update.It doesn't have proximity sensorBattery life is the biggest positive. On normal usage I get around 2 days battery life with around 11 hours screen time
Heavy in weight,3.0,"Mobile have a decent look,For this money range we should not expect high,It will flexible to our parents for youth, you should think twice,Battery life was good, Fingerprint was perfect,Face unlock when light was sufficient it works good,In low light bit late but works.Main drawback was weight of mobile it was bit heavy.Front Camera have decent image in daylight, but we will observe Noise in Image.Something with back Camera.This review is purely my experience with M12 mobile."
Not worth buying,1.0,"Bought this new phone for my mom on 5th Oct.. the day I recieved the phone I had issue with camera quality (checked and confirmed by Amazon technician as well) also faced issue with dialler tone while making call.. there was no sound of the dialler tone.. Amazon replaced and sent me a new phone on the 9th Oct.The new phone had no issue with Camera but issue with dialler tone was still there. I raised the issue with Amazon and they provided me an appropriate solution with amazing service and initiated the refund.I don't think Samsung phones are worth buying at the price range of below 10k.I might prefer going for Realme, MI, Vivo or any other brand over Samsung."
Basic knox secured Samsung phone,4.0,"Decent phone at 9,000 (after bank offers). The processor and display are not upto the standard. But given that this phone has knox security, I have little to complain about. This phone is strictly for old people who just needs a secure phone for day to day usage like messaging, calling, etc. Not recommended for any user who wants to do a lot of multitasking or gaming."
Ear piece speaker not working from day one.,1.0,The ear piece speaker is not working from day one . I had gifted the phone to a senior citizens. He was using the phone on speaker mode. He did not tell me about it until I found him using speaker to talk. By the time I came to know about the issue 7 days had past. Now no return option available. And I went to samsung authorised service centre there they don't have spares to rectify the problem. So still we are using the phone with speaker on. Did not expect such a quality from a big brand like samsung. Feeling very disappointed.
Don't buy it..worst ever experience with Samsung13 product,1.0,Not up to mark performance.Not upto mark battery life.Not up to mark sensor.Very dull audioThird class camera quality.
fake commitment,2.0,"battery 6000 mAh But in actuality, That is equal to 5000mAhCAMRA quality is very low. I have a Realme 3i. that phone has a much better camera. the selfy camera is a pure C grade.90Hz Refresh Rate but it doesn't seemI checked these 3 things carefully, then there is no quality in all three. As said. So there is no guarantee that the rest of the things that are being given in the commitment will also be correct."
Nothing,4.0,"As far as my opinion is concerned, the over all features are Ok. The drawback features are:1. M12 is out of Super Amolrd Screen.2. Back Fingerprint is more covenient than side3. Camera quality is not so hifi than other models4. S Bike mode should given, which will be helpful ehile driving..5. Charger model is different  than other M series Mobiles with battery of 6000 mah."
"All good, except fingerprint sensor",4.0,"For its cost, I believe the phone is worth it. Till now, it hasn't shown any problems. Everything works fine. Battery is magnificent. Only problem is the fingerprint sensor. It is on the side on top of the power button. So, the space is very small. Most of the back covers or flip covers cover this fingerprint sensor partially and the device does not unlock."
Go for other option,1.0,Not up to the mark too many cons1)phone ram management is not good it hangs too much 90hz screen is only for show whenever u set screen at 90hz its start hamging2) VGA camera is better than this 48megapixal camera3)when i start mobile and setup it hang and restart more than 2 time so i will suggest  dongo for this phone
Could be better,2.0,Main demerit is noise cancellation. It cancels MY VOICE in video calls. NOISE CANCELLATION SHOULD CANCEL BACKGROUND NOISE. HERE IT DOES JUST THE OPPOSITE. Very annoying. Battery life is good. Camera is below average. 48mp works like 4.8 mp.
Best At 9499(6GB /128GB ) From Samsung,5.0,"Very Good Cameras , Decent Day To Day Tasking , Better Sound Quality with Dolby Atmos , Screen Is TFT With High Quality . But Colour Not Much Natural Or Saturated . little Bit Faded Type . Mobile Goes Smoothly When It's on 60hz Refresh Rate . Battery Is Beast . Lasts 8hrs SOT . Charges With 1hr 30min with Standard 15w Charger"
Don't buy go for Samsung M21,1.0,"I have been using Samsung M21, also my 2 family members using same model.So thought to buy this M12 for my father.1. Biggest disappointment DisplayLooks like a old age mobile2. Camera is ok ok3. Only good thing is battery 🔋.4. Cheap plastic body5. Heavyweight6. Go for Samsung M21 it's more better."
Budgeted phone ever,3.0,"Its a budgeted phone. 6 GB/ 128 GB storage variant is good. Battery backup is awesome. Took 3-3.5 hrs to full charge. Not happy with front camera quality & Awful at night. NO slow motion capturing feature. Rear camera is better in daylight & good at night. Not happy with side touch sensor. Took so many attempts sometimes to unlock. But, overall I am happy using it because navigation sensor, battery backup & performance of phone is good compared with other brands."
Mid range good quality.12 hajar ke andar acchi mobile h,4.0,This is good product battery life is awesome internal memory is good 128GB good for gaming is mid range mobile.lttle bit heavy weight. Acchi mobile hai 12 hajar ke andar game khelne k liye v best hai.battery v bahut chalti hai.but camera utna accha nahi h.baki sab thik h wajan thoda jyada hai
good,3.0,"after using the phone almost 4 months1. phone is not super fast what company is claiming infact it is slow sometimes.2. If fully charged battery stays 24 to 30 hours even after heavy use but problem is with the time taken for the battery charging is toooo long. so people having busy schedule will always face low in battery, and searching for where to charge 🤔. 15 amp charger kaun deta hain re Samsung?3. M series has bad reputation for software essue but I Did not faced yet except Bluetooth sometimes turned off automatically while listening music.Overall price has dropped 1000 Rs now. I bought it at 10500 Rs. You can buy it, sexy looks. works well."
The phone keeps showing a black screen with logo,1.0,"The phone keeps showing a black screen with logo. And doesn't allow to use the phone even after multiple  tapping on screen or trying to use the fingerprint sensor. It takes almost 2-5 minutes for it to allow to use the phone. The issue persists while tge phone is in use or even when left idle. Hence the battery keeps draining. I tried restarting the phone but it didn't help. But the worst of all was that I switched off the phone, but the phone just turned on on its own. So their switch off doesn't work."
Nice phone at that range,4.0,Nice phone....having long battery life upto 2 to 3 days on one charging... because of 6000mah battery its a bit heavier but fingerprint scanner is on lock key that is awesome thing I have seen......camera is decent too... special selfie camera bright and clear...overall nice phone
An average phone.,3.0,"An average phone. I was in a hurry to get a phone for my mom on the same day. Hence chose this model. It's an average phone.Main camera is good.Battery is awesome.Display is 720p. Looks decent but could have been 1080. The 90hz makes the phone smoother.Processor is very slow. Suitable for calling , taking pics, important apps like gpay, WhatsApp , etc. Very basic games works fine. Not for heavy usage.Phone weighs too much cuz of 6000mah battery. It is on the bulkier side.Overall an average phone.Compare Poco m3, redmi note 10 before buying. And could go for it if you don't want a Chinese product."
Super buy,4.0,"Face recognition is slow. otherwise the phone is super awesome. My 4 months old iPhone se 2020 ran into some hardware issues, due to pandemic I couldn't service it. So I brought this m12 phone, just to be in budget for obvious reason. This phone is under 9999 and if your expecting performance similar to a 40k, then your review needs a think over. This phone exactly does or does more than what it's priced. If you are low budget and want more out of it with some limitations, go for it."

Got used and seal opened product,1.0,"I ordered samsung galaxy m12 in blue color. I got used product with open seal. I called the Amazon and they agreed to return it. Thankfully!What I noticed about this model was it looks cheap.. As back is made up of cheap plastic. It's very heavy, which is not comfortable to use. Camera quality was awful for a 48 megapixel camera (Redmi camera is much better in same pixels) . It's shocking and disappointing.I did use this mobile so can't say anything about performance and battery life. Overall it's a series of disappointments.If you have a low budget(8550 after bank discount) then go for it! Else I recommend micromax in 1 or any other brand with good ratings. It's for normal usage, best for old parents who don't need much Features. Anyone other then that, is a BIG NOO."
"Head Phone/Ear Phone and also back cover is Not available in box ,it very disappoin",5.0,"Head Phone/Ear Phone and also back cover is Not available in box ,it very disappoint ,Pls provide both in feature new module .Mi and OnePluse they will provide Head Phone/Ear Phone and also back cover is available in box.Why Samsung it not providing these Both -Head Phone/Ear Phone and also back cover is available in boxIn feature if is available custmer is mor happy and satisfied .Please provide in feature .."

Basic phone with basic value,4.0,"Wanted a second phone with good battery life- Good value for money in the 10/11k range- great battery life- camera quality is average- dual sim feature is a bonus- can be used as a primary phone if the usage is not heavy, or works like a charm as a secondary phone"
Worst Samsung mobile : Amazon should have to product grading from own professionals before launch,1.0,"I was strongly buying Samsung phones and advise to friends also because of its robustness. But I have worst experience with Samsung Galaxy M12 as its screen picture and camera quality are third class. Even my old Mi redimi 4 phone has a better camera and screen picture (although I am not promoting it).  It was also the fault of amazon as they launch Samsung phones at the festival without assessing the quality and grading of products from its own professionals to check their worthiness. We people buy it with the name of co's such as samsung and amazon. See, how we are easily deceived by amazon company.I strongly advise people that before buying products of such range, pls check its quality from the market"
Overall good phone but Some features they have removed are...,4.0,"The phone is overall good but you should know that what they have cut from the features to reduce the price. Firstly the phone's GPS is worst. Secondly you cannot connect to 5 ghz band wifi. Third, the phone when it came was bloated with 3rd party apps and galaxy pay was a real pain to remove from home screen. I also noticed that you cannot change internet access to a particular app in settings(which is possible in other androids). These are minor things and I don't care about it that much but the company should clearly provide details of such removed features, especially the GPS."
Not bad at these price,3.0,Loved this color.Cons:* heating issue*screen heating while charging*doesnt feel fast charging ( adapter provided is not 15w)* Not feeling 90 hz refreshing rate* battery drain fast ( not feeling 6000 mah battery life )*weight is little high*sound quality is not good (sometimes cant hear phone ringing) Pros:Camera quality goodVideo quality goodNice colorGood at this price (brought @10499)On time deliveryHope build quality of Samsung will be good
Great Battery backup,4.0,"First what I like1. Great battery backup. I charge the phone on morning and just need to realx. It goes whole day without need to recharge.2. Good camera phone in the price range. Fair3. Good for games that I play. But yes, not the best gaming experience.What I didn't like:1. Hang sometimes."
Software is just too bad,1.0,There are lots and lots of bugs in this phone.Initially the permission module was not working that means you cannot give any permission to any app. How can they even launch with such a critical issue.This was solved after a software update.But then I am facing issue with mobile hotspot. Mobile hotspot automatically stops working and then does not gets turned on.You have to restart your mobile to turn on mobile hotspot which is very annoying.
The only Good One in M series🙄,5.0,Pros-•Good Battery Life•Good Camera (Back)(Better than M11🙄)•Z Plus Ram(excess ram more than 4GB IF NEEDED)•90Hz adaptive refresh rate•Smooth PerformanceCons-•Front Camera is Average•Too Many Useless apps When you First Buy it•Back Camera not suitable for Night condition•Saturation of Camera is Too High
"Awesome phone within 10K budget, a sure shot Redmi killer",5.0,"Simply an amazing smartphone from Samsung within 10k, a rival killer launched. Bought this for my dad and he is extremely satisfied with the performance, camera is decent enough, sound quality is pretty good and battery life is awesome!! Grip is good with the combi finish at the back. On the cons, a bit on the heavier side and slightly thicker compared to its rivals, but definitely not a deal breaker. With 90 Hz refresh rate, the pros surely weigh high over the cons, just go for it."
Not a good phone in this price range,3.0,The main reason going for samsung is amoled display but my bad may be I should have read specifications but it's a miss.. blindly went by brand Samsung...two major dissapointments1. There is no amoled screen...the screen is not so good where we get lesser rate MI phones with more good specs.2. There's no dual WiFi band... My wifi is set as 5ghz but this phone doesn't show up..I believe there are cheaper phones in MI and Realme with more specs than this Samsung
Phone to achcha hai but….,4.0,"Phone to achcha hai. Main Sri lanka se, par India se mangvaya. rs9499 mei to value lagta hai. Lkn camera 48 hone par b dooor ke fotos ki pictures quality to theek nh. But selfie aur normal distance ke fotos  to theek hai. Meine ise online classes ke liye kharida. So iske liye theek laga. Face ID to andhere me kaam nhi karta. Battery bhi theek hai. Abhi 5dinon se classes ke lie use kia. Aur kya kahun? Amazon me jo b details dekha use dekh kar kharida. Ummid thodi si thi ki camera ke bare me. Iske alawa overall theek hai."
Wonderful phone for so low cost,5.0,Wonderful phone for the provided price. This was bought for my father .I was using one plus 7 pro and due to repair I was forced to use this phone for a week and to be honest other than camera I was more than satisfied with this mobile and its performance
Good product.,5.0,"Product is good, a bit too heavy because of its 6000 mah battery. Rest is all good.Saw lots of negative reviews on amazon, hence was sceptical about buying this one. But so far no such problem have I encountered. Hence I am feeling happy about the decision I made."
Audio Output Too Low,3.0,"I have gone through many reviews for this phone. But, I've not seen anyone talking about sound quality. Maybe their handsets are working absolutely fine.. Maybe my particular handset is troublesome. Anyways, since I got the phone on my hand, I couldn't explore as much as I should but overall my experience with Samsung is not up to the mark. I purchased Samsung's phone hoping to get some amazing performance which the company and other reviewers (mainly YouTube reviewers) claim.I am not that technically sound person to digest every single term the phone companies (manufacturers) use these days. Still, I've gathered a little bit of knowledge and experience after using various smartphones over the long 11-12 years.I got this model (Galaxy M12) exchanged with Redmi 8A Dual which was not that much worse.. The sound was pretty loud be it media sound, ringtones, call sound, etc.Frankly speaking, I've not checked gaming, camera and other features the way I did with sound quality. I'd recommend experience yourself before you buy this phone if at all possible."
"Mobile is getting struck, hangon and is not getting updated",1.0,Slow in finger print reading and mobile functioning is not quick as shown.Also approached the service center. Many customers r facing mobile hanging on issue and screen struck issues. This is my second mobile in Samsung. Waste of money.
Good for consuming data not for creators.,1.0,"After 1 month use, some serious sensors are missing which will make google maps almost useless on the phone. Camera quality is good only for day time that too depends on mood of the camera. Sluggish phone you can see phone saving photo even after quiting the camera app. Serious processor problems. I bought 6/128 variant and felt sorry for whoever bought 4 gig version. Good for minimal users and for saving tonns of photos via apps but not from the phone's camera. BGIM was surprisingly good on the phone thanks to its large screen. Also good for online classes and OTT viewers."
Budget phone for 5g but speaker quality is bad...Phone vibrates if u play some song.,3.0,"If one wants to buy a budget 5g phone Made in India, it is the one below 15000 rupees.Bad cameraBad speaker. Phone practically vibrates if one plays a song...I think speaker's location should be changed in Samsung mobiles.."
They mentioned that their is a headphone with phone but there is no headphone with mobile phone,2.0,After using more than 6 months ...I can give the batter review....in this phone I faces sound issues... it's not good on sound basicsAnd if we  come to calling from this mobile ...it's not good sometime the sound is not auditable even you can't hear other person voice and calling voice
Wring the review after 6months of usage. Poor performance.,2.0,Wring the review after 6 months of usage. The phone is good if you are a normal user but if you are a gamer and want a high end permormance then don't go for it. For normal day to day usage its good. The phone is good for budget only. I am a first time samsung user previously used lenovo and motorola brands but after using samsung I will again switch to my previous brands that are far better in terms of performance than this. But samsung has its premium phones also at higher range that may be good but not sure about that.
If you're not a selfie person I would recommend this.,4.0,In this price range for the moment one of the best deals. 6000mAh battery really does the job. Fingerprint reader is sensitive but if you using mobile with cover it becomes difficult due to its position. Camera not great not terrible. Touch sensitivity is not that great sometimes it slides when I want to open an app but not that major problem. If you want something with high battery and RAM and storage this is the mobile.
Touch is not working properly.,1.0,"I have only given low rating in this 2 parameters just because of touch of this phone is not working properly. Video or photo is also not telling all the truth. Physical verification is required, kindly change my mobile, I require same product. Also the person who will visit tomorrow to check my mobile , didn't connect with me till now. facing lot of difficulty by purchasing this phone, Amazon is big brand need some urgent solution."
Apps not supported,3.0,"Lot of apps are not compatible. I am surprised. I know the phone is cheaper and the expectations should be accordingly but I never thought that it will have restrictions on the app's. We'll if u really want to know which app I'm talking about, it's Insta 360. I have a camera and I want to use it but connecting it to my phone but the app doesn't support .Fingerprint doens't work properly. Need to try couple of times to make it work."
Worst Phone i have purchased,1.0,I have made worst purchase of my life by buying this phone through amazon!! Its screen doesn't  respond to my lock screen password & even some times does allow to enter full screen lock password. Please think twice/enquire yourself before buying  this phone. In fact don't buy this phone. I had made a mistake & purchased this phone.
"Dam waste product, i lost 13,499 Rs by choosing this phone",1.0,"Please do not buy this phone because Samsung Galaxy M12 phone generating too much heat with this I can not operate the phone in normal condition. I kept the order in return and the authorized technician came and he decided, the is phone working normal but the compliant was too much heat generates when it's in the handset, in this case, how I could not take calls and operate the mobile. there is no return policy and only replacement but that also not happened. I was very much disappointed with amazon's service and I lost 13499/- and my requirement not fulfilled."
"Worst Mobile - bad display, processor, camera and heavy",1.0,"Waste productits very heavy cant hold for 5 mins6GB ram cant even play fruit ninja gamewaste camera6years old just HD display.Samsung bloatwareswhat would i say be best apart from battery,returned.!"
Not  a phone that I would recommend,3.0,Quite disappointed with the phone. Recently bought.The camera is mediocre. It lacks night mode and the picture quality is average. Also Colours are not true to colour. Will not recommend this phone. And no glass protection provided for the screen.
I an not happy.,1.0,"The phone I ordered was a Samsung Galaxy M12 manufactured by Samsung Electronics India, as REPUBLIC DAY OFFER, but the one supplied was manufactured by UIL Electronics. I wonder how Amazon could arrange a phone (manufactured by an unauthorised company) at the original quoted price.  Amazon will thus lose its credibility by cheating its customers. Since I needed the phone urgently for online classes of my children, I retained and not returned."
Don't buy,1.0,Camera quality and performance too bad plz don't buy samsung m12
"For a normal user, this is the best option.",5.0,One UI 3.1 and 90hz display makes the user experience heavenly. It has a 8nm processor and really power efficient. Without compromising in the perfomance it gives me more than 2 days of battery life. Camera is decent and the colour reproduction is very good.No hanging or heating problems.It can run high end games in low to medium settings as well but I won't recommend this for gaming purpose.Lot's of features included with the One UI 3.1 core which I liked the most. Overally a great phone for Normal users 👌
Poor network,2.0,"Every thing is OK for this phone, but the network sucks, suddenly 4G connection goes down, I have to change some network settings auto to manual or vice versa, it works for next 5-10minutes. Again network goes down."
A budget friendly MONSTER!!!!!!!!!!!,4.0,"I ordered it on 2nd of may and got it on 5th of may. I am pretty much with which which the phone comes. This phone has really exceeded a lot of expectations regarding the features that its loaded with. But the only thing with which  I am disappointed with is its size🤔, its quiet ""fat""😅to say. But really.... I am astonished with its battery backup. It's a huge for phones in this price range. It comes with 6000mah battery which I felt, a #monster precisely😳. The camera....OMG!!!!!its just too good. It comes with 84mp quad camera . It has a 10x zoom, which is super clear. The fingerprint reader is mounted on the side,down the volume button. It's too awesome. It  senses the print, even on a thin plastic sheet is placed on it. Other than all this , to say, it a great budget friendly and a must buy on the other hand. It should be in one's list , if he/she is looking for the #monster in 10k bracket💯👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼"
Pathetic technician support,5.0,Faulty product... Touch not working it gets unreaponsive multiple times...Technician only called instead of doing visit and didn't even done the complete inspection with inspect app... And asked to me to inform the customer care team that visit was done . Also assured that replacement will be done. In the evening closed the query stating no issue was found in phone .  Thats really pathetic ...deifinitely m going to post on social media and ceo
Weak point,3.0,The weak point is camera both side is really not so good an average quality of camera but Okey!Second one is charging speed is tooo slow 15 W 😂 about 3 hours + take to full up!But I brought for my uncle so I think this was the best smartphone for him..Under 10k superb smartphone.(Grate indian festival sale offer)
A Non Gamers perfect Buy!!,4.0,"I bought this phone for my mother as a secondary phone.Gamingbwas our of question, needed good battery life and goo calling support.Pros -Battery Life is amazing, the phone never heats up. No matter what.It's a sub par processor. But does the normal job. Don't play or install any games on this. Use it for calls, media.One UI is clean. But make sure to delete all the junk apps and disable swing seevices.90Hz is actually visibleCamera bump is non existentThere is WiFi calling, unlime a lot of people suggest.ConsHeavy and thick phone.Stutters when you give it some intense job.No 5GHz WiFiColours aren't the best at this price. Display could have been much better. But won't notice Unless you compare it side by side.For 10k it's a good buy for a light user.If you're a heavy user. Go for Poco M3 or Redmi Note 10 or Micromax In1 if ur budget is 10k."
Phone touch and slowness,2.0,"When i started using the phone its touch was not working properly. Sometime i had to touch some option multiple times still it wont work. Note i just started to use so there were not much apps installed. Amazon replaced the phone within a week but the replacement phone had other issue. Although touch was working okay but it was very slow, hanging and heating up. Again this was right after i started using phone after unboxing.Finally i asked for refund second time and Amazon did great to refund me. So 1* for phone but 4.5* for Amazon service. Thanks"
A value for money device,4.0,Everything is good except sound output & front camera. The sound output is not loud enough in full volume and pic quality is not good with the front camera. The phone is a bit bulky but stutrdy.
Don't fall for the price. Lot to look into details,3.0,"It does not come with back cover, screen guard, sim slot pin.Charger wire is very small.Display is averageOppo & Vivo displays are far better comparativelySoftware is bit laggy and not so ease of use.Software features are not great"
The Best In The Market,5.0,I have been using Samsung Galaxy M series for over 2 years.  Never had any reason to complain.  You get possibly everything you look for in a mobile phone at an affordable price.  Plus the much needed durability.
"Good for mobile savvy and general users ,not addicted to games only",4.0,"Nothing  found against except it is  a little bulky ,and plastic on back is ordinary ,but it is budget phone and can not be compared with S21 or I phone .It is good for above ordinary use with occasional gaming, Battery easily last for more than two days,I can say you get more than you pay photo. In day light is very good ,uploaded photo is in low light at around 6 pmMovies on Netflix were enjoyable with good sound and colour"
Monster 3 day battery,5.0,"Bought it for my mother, its a good phone with monster battery backupPros:Battery 6000 mahAndroid 1190 hertz display8 nm processorRear camera 48mp sony imx sensorDisplayCall quality4 years ota update supportNo lag issueCons:Speaker is not great it gest louder but too shrillProtection cover not included in the box8MP average front cameraPs its a good phone best phone to gift your loved ones"
Solid overall performer,5.0,"The fingerprint reader is placed at an ideal location and works without fail. The battery life is really good even though it takes a long time to charge so in all good. camera quality of the primary camera is good for everyday use. The design of the phone is such that it does not wobble and there are no protruding camera. The built quality feels solid. No fingerprint smudges.I have experienced some jitters but nothing to complain about. Calling over WiFi facility works very good and the earpiece quality is decent. No issues with proximity sensor. Though it lacks the bells and whistles of its competitors, it does well. There is nothing extraordinary to write about, but it is actually good as there are nothing extremely negative to write about. Buy it and it will work as its supposed to. Also trusting on Samsung brand name for data privacy."
My old phone is better than this,1.0,My old phone is very old and i purchased it in 2017 and it hangs less than this phone its camera quality is not good its battery life is ok but its performance is worst i cant play game it lags so much.
Not up to the mark,1.0,"I have been using samsung mobiles ,different models for a long time.This one,side key I have to press 3,4 times to switch on mobile when I purchased it.Difficult to take screenshots too..Within 3 months side key is not at all working and mobile got switched off.Such an unfortunate experience as I am a Samsung user for a long time.I couldn't check the side key as it is online purchase and for the initial period I thought may be because I am not familiar with new mobile and the product's fault.So I couldn't return it too.."
Avarage budjet phone.,2.0,After four month i m writing this review. After four month my phone power button is not work. Then i bring service center they replaced the button now is working i don't know how long it will be work. Other function are good. Sometimes cellurar net work problem also i faced.. Samsung its very budjet phone
"Affordable, Battery lasting, and a Camera Gem!",4.0,"Pros:Great Battery Life. Upto 2 days minimum.Great Camera.Superior smoothness in usability4GB RAM for multitasking.Built and feel of the phone.I use the phone primarily for clicking product photos for my website, and business calls. On a personal level, a powerful battery and camera saves me time and gives me a hassle free experience.  I use all sorts of video and image editing apps that requires a lot of ram usage and the phone has never crashed so far. Also does well for gaming. Hard core gaming may be sluggish. But for the price perspective, this phone is all you ever need.Cons:Face Detection  for unlocking — takes atleast 3 seconds to react. The fingerprint sensor is comparatively faster. But both is a little annoying at times."
After using phone for a Year,4.0,"For price  5/5For battery life  4.5/5For performance  4/5For storage  4.5/5For Camera  4/5But for Sound  3/5Now u know it's good phone in this budgetI bought this in 10,000 /-Apart from sound range... it's well to do phone"
Good battery life but not good for reading,4.0,Good phone good battery life good for everyday use the only problem I see is even when you turn on the eye comforter your eyes pain I have sensitive eyes and I can't use bright screens ! Display of my old Redmi is better than this in all other areas this is better than the Redmi budget phone
Heavily built. Overpriced for this below mid range smartphone.,3.0,Mobile weighs heavy. And it's below mid-range segment . More over over priced while purchasing. Not recommended at all.. camera performance genuinely below average. Best thing is only it has wide L1 Certification. They would have gone for atleast for super Amoled screenNot worth for money...
Internet Problem (Value for money),3.0,There is only 1 problem I observed that  the internet is not working properly. Videos are running intermittently even on high speed Wi-Fi. Web pages also does not load as expected.Other than that working fine and all the expected feature in this range. Its fingerprint sensor in power button.
After 1 week of use,4.0,"This product is fantastic for this price! I tested the Battery life and for a heavy user, it can easily last you and day or a day and a half. And for a light user, it can last you 2 - 3 days! Also, the cameras are decent, the front camera is ok in low light or in some cases indoor lighting, but the front camera is pretty good! I have seen phones with these exact same features for double the price! The screen is respectable it's not pixely, but it's not the best ofc. The screen is pretty smooth, its 90hz is really nice and smooth. Gaming on this phone is ok. I mean like I told you the battery can last you a long time, and the same thing applies to gaming now ofc the battery will run out faster but not significantly faster. Playing the actual game its self is decent only the VERY high-powered games is a bit laggy on this phone but most of the games work smoothly. I would give this phone a 4 star just because the front camera could have been better."
Worst phone to buy,1.0,I brought this product 2 months before (May 2022) and trust me this mobile is so worst thst you will feel that you should throw this away in drain or sewer nearby. Company has cheated me and in India we dont have proper laws to complsint against these private organizations. If you value your money please dont but this phone or you can contact me if you want my samsung m12 for free .
Best Smart phone in Economy price,5.0,After doing a lot of research I have chosen this phone which is one of the top branded. You can get in good price with awesome Specs. Most of the new Companies will give you a different and huge configurations. But they never meet the expectations. ... But Samsung is the one in best they will give good quality hardware and with awesome specs as well.
Phone is decent but it's camera and processor is way bad,2.0,"Pro's1 battery life stands full day2 90hz display3 back camera is goodCons1 very poor front camera2 hangs sometime3 bad processor can't handle heavy game4 slow charging5 no features in camera , even only 3 feature in pro mode6 no gyroscope , bad for gyro playerConclusionPhone is good for normal user , gamers stay away from this one it's really bad in gaming experience and also hangs sometimesDon't buy this one go for another one in this range"
Super one..,5.0,"If you are looking mobile at this rate ....the best choice is this m12....really loved its features..prons:1)battery life 6000mah it would come for 1 1/2 day with average use2)display was really amazing really loved this huge display..colour,sound was simple good3)camera are nice i took some good shots from them4)it comes with nice os operator +andriod 11.0 v is good in it..5)Soft touch and fringer print and face detection sensor also works well.cons:1)The processor can be better...this processor is good for average usage and average graphics games2)The weight is some what more....finally good phone for this cost compared to all other phone at this range..."
BELOW STANDARD SMELL,3.0,NOT WORTH FOR MONEY.  IT DOESN'T HAVE THE FACILITY FOR INSTALLING COMPASS.  YOU CAN'T HEAR PROPERLY.  NO QUALITY OF SOUND AND VOLUME.  FOR INTERNET CONNECTION IT WILL NOT TAKE 5G SIGNALS.  NORMAL CLICKED PHOTOS ARE BELOW AVERAGE.
Samsung M12,5.0,"Samsung’s M12 of a 90Hz screen is a budget phone. the giant 6,000mAh battery and clean UI make up for it to some extent, making the Galaxy M12 a decent buy.The Galaxy M12 feels rigid and offers a firm construction. There is no fingerprint sensor on the back with Samsung choosing instead to integrate it with the power button.good to see Samsung using a USB Type-C port for its affordable devices, and that is present at the bottom alongside the 3.5mm headphone jack and speaker grille. he display on the Galaxy M12 is a 6.5-inch HD+ (720 x 1,600) TFT panel that has a 90Hz adaptive refresh rate. In its price range, the Galaxy M12 appears to be the only phone with a high refresh rate. the display is a standard panel with healthy peak brightness, controlled saturation levels, and minimal colour shift when viewed at an angle. A quad-camera system is present on the Galaxy M12 which comprises a 48MP primary sensor with an f/2.0 aperture, a 5MP secondary ultra-wide lens with a massive 123-degree field of view, a 2MP depth, and a 2MP macro sensor. As far as budget phones go, the Galaxy M12 does a decent job of capturing details  At night, the camera is a bit inconsistent and a slight shake can induce blurriness in the shots. I keep my expectations about low-light photography in check from a lot of budget phones, but the M12 is above average and good. Lastly, you get a beefy 6,000mAh battery that is very likely going to last you two days on moderate usage."
Best for normal use,3.0,"This mobile is best for normal use. If you use more apps then go for 6gb ram bcoz more apps are going to lack this phone. I have around 28 external apps which I use on daily basis,but my mobile is lacking,so I have to delete some apps for smoothing."
Good quality & built phone in a budget,4.0,"Honestly the phone deserves a rating of 4.5 (deduction 0.5 due to certain minuses of missings like absence of dual band etc)...Overall, the phone feels extremely premium to use with high refresh rate, reasonably fast & zappy processor, good primary camera etc.Another major factor to consider is that the phone is extremely well built & the weight is very evenly distributed...."
Good phone for 10K....,4.0,A good product from Samsung at this cost. The highlight is its battery life which lasts for more than 2 days for average user. Camera are decent with average ram speed. Fingerprint sensor is on right so it feels different from other phones and give a good look to mobile. Got  the product on time with proper package by Amazon.😇
Awesome phone but faulty adapter,5.0,I have been using this phone for last 2 months.The battery backup of this phone is too good. It lasts for 2 or 3 days with low usage. Camera is good.The fingerprint sensor responds quickly.In this price range it is worthy. But after 2-3 month adapter stopped working and sparking.
Another good product from Samsung Galaxy M12,4.0,"Another good product from Samsung Galaxy M12.  Battery life is very good. Performance is not as good as Qualcomm Snapdragon, but its ok. Only you will find performance difference when you play games. Features are excellent. Camera Quality also good. Value for Money in this range."
Worst Mobile and worst service by Amazon.in,1.0,"Worst mobile. I suggest not to buy this product. The device came defective in display and os. A request has been placed for return, and called Amazon several times. They always said the pickup will take place in 3 days. Since 30 days, no one came for pickup till now. I don't know to whom I should complain. I am thinking to file a case in consumer forum. Anyone please suggest me the process. Also let me know if there is any possibility to file the case online. Any useful suggestions are greatly appreciated.Thank you."
Snapshot feature missing. No guesture for snapshot.,4.0,It got deliver on 14th April. After using few days I find my moto phone was better in features. I am not able to take screenshot using power button + vol down button. It always show Power off + restart + emergency.Motion and guestures features are limited compare to moto. No option for 3 finger touch screen shot or palm slide screenshot. Rest is ok. Not much imprressed.
Ok wala Phone,3.0,Built quality GoodBattery 🔋is Super GoodCamera you can expect more than this from a phone costs 10kPhone is lagging too much of you have more than 15 apps.Very slow performance.I am not a gamer also I don't play any single game. But still the device runs slow.
Do not Buy,3.0,"Device is Heavy.Camera Quality is very poor.Screen Quality is very poor compare to othwr device in market.Fast charging is OkBattery backup is also Ok.I would recommend try other device in the same segment Like Redmi, Mi, Poco."
Does the job,3.0,"The build quality is decent. Battery life lasts a day easy. Overall it’s a 3.5 out of 5 phone. Considering it’s a Samsung, there is a bit of bloat on the UI. The OS will lag after a week. But considering the price, it’s an “okay” device."
need more improvement,3.0,"samsung made very good mobile but it is not provided some important features like speed charging,camara zoom stability and speed charge port etc.some useless apps also provide by samsung which unnessary. in the case of software design samsung need to improve a lot."
Battery drains very very fast,2.0,The battery drains very fast even with moderate use. Drops from 90 to 60 within 40 min. Wish there was an easy way to take screenshots. I find it almost impossible to use the power and volume buttons simultaneously
Good phone. Position of fingerprint sensor sometimes annoying.,4.0,"Phone is good. Good battery life.UI is not simple and straight forward. Especially finding a  configuration in settings is  not  simpler and intuitive. Probably, those who get used to stock Android UI finds it difficult to use.No, apps  listing screen.Position of fingerprint sensor is annoying. When you are holding a phone in hands and listening to music/radio. It either opens up or locked the biometric due to multiple attempts."
It's a meh phone,3.0,"Good phone for the price. The responsiveness of the screen to touch is a little wanting. Battery not as good as expected, lasts for about a day and a half with moderate usage.  Camera is great but it's a pain to select and toggle through the settings. Really have to look hard to realise it is a high resolution image. My other purchase is an M12 which feels really premium compared to this phone. The price difference at time of purchase was only 2k."
Within 10 days charger pin not working and demanding 1300 rs.,1.0,"Within 10days charging pin not working, service center people asking for 1300rs for charging pin, this is a fraud, they say 1 year warranty. Within 10 days they are not providing any warranty. Service center address was given by Samsung customer care. How can a productdont have manufacturing warranty. Don't know for what they provide warranty. This is looking a complete fraud thing. I strongly recommend not to buy this phone. I got so good products previously from Amazon not these type of."
Worst Phone I have ever Seen with this price.,1.0,"Worst Phone I have ever Seen with this price. Nothing is good except battery. Camera quality is very poor, Phone is very heavy, Sound quality is very poor. I will never recommend to anyone to buy Samsung Phone. One of my friend had recommended to go with Samsung phone. I think he has no idea about the quality of phone."
Awesome purchase.,5.0,"Satisfied with product. Camera quality is okay. Other than that, its a samsung, whoever is used to samsung will love the functioning of this device too.If you are a samsung lover, definately go for it. If you are conscious about new features, gaming, camera quality other options might be available at given price point. Its great for day to day tasks and surfing internet, social media and all. Thumbs up for Samsung"

Value for money,1.0,bought on  Amazon festival sale. After 10 days received phone. To my surprise phone was not charging and on trouble shooting found issue in charging cable. Didn't expect this quality from Samsung. Delay  of delivery is pinching too. I could have bought in a in person store and avoided all these hassles. raised return but didn't get call even after 15days was forced to used phone and buy my own cable. if something goes wrong only god can save.. don't trust amazon nor these vendors.. amazon stopped picking my support calls.
Budget Phone from Samsung with all basic functions,4.0,"Got this phone @7749 after Exchange & bank discount at this rate no branded mobile may not come with Android 11..., so far is good still needs to check in all respects but all basic functions are working fine."
Power efficient and looking,4.0,"All over best phone to buy at this price range.Pros-*UI is too easy to operate very fast based on android one.*Battery 🔋 is too good giving back-up upto 10 hrs of heavy duty.*Charger is 15w slidely charging fast.*Display is very power efficient & size is good.*No heating issue.*Security review is good*Processor Speed is likely good.*Fingerprint sensor is very fast & side mountedCons-*Camera features are not given like pro mode, slow-motion, fast motion.*Photo quality need to be more advanced.*Device is little bit thik causing of the powerful 6000 mah battery.*Display is not so bright also not so dark & colour are not displaying as expected.*Expected amoled display as Samsung always given in the past.*Speaker sounds like good but volume is not so loud*Weight is little bit heavy."
Good model,5.0,"Reading all the negative reviews lowered my expectations. I bought it for my mother and it's an awesome model. The processor works fast enough, camera quality is decent and the display is good too.my mother loved it and at the given price range it's a must buy."
Very low quality product from Samsung compared to their other products,2.0,The M12 is very low quality product in terms of display which has very faded colors and the screen is a magnet for fingerprints and other forms of dirt.It does not even have high speed WiFi (5Ghz) which I was expecting.Compared this to very marginally higher priced M21 which is leaps ahead in terms of specs and product quality.
"NOT bad,",3.0,"You can't really complain about anything at this price point.Still some things to point out:1. Heavy as a brick 212g!! Will take some time to get used to.2. (For power users) Not full one ui. Uses one ui core. Sound Assistant, Good lock, bixby don't work.3. Not Amoled, TFT screen.4. Not a gaming phoneNow the pros:1. 90hz screen feels great2. 48mp camera is awesome, colors are good too.3. Good battery, 1.5 days backup approxOverall satisfied."
Very basic phone. Not as good as other phones in the market at this price range,3.0,"Pros:Good display, good battery life.Cons:1. Pros are already present in other phones.2. Camera quality is very bad. Pictures are not very grainy and not sharp. Colors look dull. Photos are comparable to older nokia phone pictures.3. Touchscreen is not very responsive and also not smooth.4. One of the biggest con is that it does not support 5GHz wifi.Overall, if you are looking for budget phone i would suggest better go for redmi note series.Even though it a budget phone it still doesn't justify its price tag. There are much better phones in the market at this price range."
"Samsung phone not working, have to restart every 30 mins",1.0,"Samsung Galaxy M12 mobile phone, bought 3 months back, motherboard is already replaced by Service center still not working properly. unable to receive or dial call for most of the time (e.g 20 hours doesn't work out of 24 hours a day). Had to restart every 30 mins. Very much annoyed as when our new phone had to visit Service center in first month itself. They are keeping the phone for 4 days and replacing motherboard still it is not completely functioning"
This is actually one of the best Budget phones ever!!,5.0,"This truly has 48mp Cam, people who say it doesn't please learn to use the Cam settings properly.A really smooth 90Hz which is though cannot be set for all time but is constant most of th time.A really Monster Battery of 6000mah, with good fast charging.Used this product for about some weeks now and it has shown consistent performance.For the Note  - I bought the 4+64 variant and it lives upto my expectations."
Go for it for medium-heavy range usage.,5.0,"Using this for more than a month now for not so heavy usage.Battery Life is VERY impressiveCharger is although 18W, still provides more than expected speed of charging.Side mounted fingerprint is pretty quick.Speakers provide just above average sound.Camera is good although not as good as proclaimed 48MP, wide angle and portrait mode available.All and all, this phone has not disppointed me.But would suggest to research other options like Redmi note 10 and compare them yourselves."
Horrible product-  Put your money somewhere else,1.0,Very disappointed with the overall performance from Samsung. This is worst samsung mobile I have seen from samsung. It's sceen quality and colors are trash. Even a old 5000 rs phone can beat it's quality. Please never ever buy this product.I will never purchase Samsung phones. Phone is lagging too much and slow. Waste of hard earning money.
Defective product,1.0,"It was shocking and surprising to see the product of company like Samsung. Immediately after installing basic apps, the images were appearing blur in all the apps. To confirm the issue, an image was captured with the rear camera and the result was same. Not acceptable in brand new phone."
Phone hsngs a lot. Not worth buying. 6gb ram is good for nothing.,1.0,"Brand new phone...started hang problem within 10 days of purchase, with 80%+ internal space untouched. 6Gb Ram is as poor as you are u cant even imagine. Phone hangs even while typing, scrolling screen, etc.Even while typing this msg....this mob hanged 6 times for 4-5sec each time.The only thing i am satisfied with in this mob is bsttery life....but again what will you do with long backup when your mob cant even type a single line without getting hang.Irritating as hell. Invest your money on better options."
Not value for money,4.0,"Not amoled display but at this price you don't deserve amoled, it is an hd display but u deserve new android 11 but it is based on android 10 and needed the "" one ui "" updated version. My old phone m30 is 2 year old but it has awesome features in "" one ui "" but this has not,  hope software update gave all this features.  But battery life is awesome and camera is average. 🙂🙂"
Poor battery,1.0,Bad product heavy weight if you use one plus. I bought this for mailing and what's app so it's working ok. At this price it's a quality product but don't expect performance like one plus or high priced phones. Battery life doesn't seems to perform like 6000 it's bad
It is gettibg hang from hang from starting .cant able to pick call.,1.0,"Cant able to attend a call ,its touch is not good. I have purchase samsung m12 on 8th march 2022. Its getting hang from starting ,touch is not responsive some time.I have been there in service center at nit faridabad branch.They have updated software.Even after that it is not working .They have asked to remove temper glass. I have removed that too.They are saying . They can only update software which they did.My issue is not resolved yet.Please help."
Bad camera quality after software upgrade,3.0,The quality of the camera decrease after software upgrade in all samsung devices.not sure why but i think after using a year the brand wants us to move to upgrade tech device. What about the money we have invested on the old device..is there a device we can use for longer time.
Disappointed with M12 overall performance,1.0,"It's been 20 days since I'm using my Samsung M12. There are so many difficulties I'm facing since then. It's  honestly not been a good experience so far. 2nd slot of the sim doesn't work most of the time, so can't make requent outgoing calls from the same. Every now and then, I've to Turn Off & On the Sim2 slot, then only it works fine. Also camera quality is pathetic. One major problem is with the fingerprint sensor. For 1st 10 days, it was working superb, but now the fingerprint  sensor mostly fails in recognising & opening the phone. Also, sometime my phone lags while working on multiple apps. Overall I'm very disappointed.Only 2 pros of this phone: Low budget & superb battery backup."
Good phone within this budget,4.0,"Fingerprint reader ,battery life and camera are 👍good as compare to others within this budget. My decision was very clear before purchasing that I would buy only phone within ₹13000 so I purchased and in my opinion  if ones budget is same then go ahead don't thing and read negative  review"
Average mobile,3.0,Samsung always disappoint me for its camera quality and always makes me happy after seeing it's bettery lifeDon't know what to put so 3 star givenFingerprint reader as fast as usualMaximum battery life .But camera and plastic body is not good
Software bloating is big concern,2.0,"Unnecessary samsung apps, which you can't uninstall. If you are not tech savvy, you are gonna face lot of problems. All the unnecessary apps will be automatically downloaded. There are pre installed apps, you neither can uninstall nor block notifications.Camera is worst in this price range. No fast charging opting available. Battery life is good. Finger print reader is ok."
Exceeds expectations !!,5.0,"The new samsung m12 is really amazing,Has a side fingerprint reader and battery quality is good.The product was delivered early with proper care.The display is good and samsung has introduced a few new quirks into the UIVery good phone for the budget."
Nice product,4.0,Nice product with in the price range with better battery back up. Camera quality is good..The only bad thing I observed is that wifi is getting connected 2.5ghz bandwidth networks but not getting connected for 5ghz higher bandwidth networks.. Otherwise I would have given 5.
Worthless for such a high price,3.0,The product has its own disadvantages1. Camara quality is not good as compare to same budget other Chinese phones.. ie mi xiomi2. Hangs alot while searching the app within the phone as per samsung it's common.3. 6 gm ram still processor is too slow 🦥
Worst camera.,2.0,the camera quality is so poor. it is a old phone like MICROMAX 3 megapixel feeling. if u want to ride vintage class car.that's appreciable. but if u spent Rs. 14000. and get the worst camera.then it's a foolish deal.
Poor Performance. Keeps Hanging. Don't Purchase,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The phone keeps on hanging for every single operation. Its camera quality is poor. Doesn't have fast charging. Overall, a poor product marketed well. Beware!"
Good buy at this price. Strong and appealing design.,4.0,"It's just 2 days of buying this phone so overall review is not possible. Few things which I want to tell about the phone. It looks and gives feeling of strong built. It's slightly heavier (though I like such phones). Battery backup is superb. Camera quality is good at this price option, front camera has noise in pictures which is common in low budget phones. Display and sound is also justifying the price. With smooth touchscreen it's overall a good budget phone which gives you a feeling of premium built and fair quality. My reason to buy this phone was the strong built quality and simple yet good design (it does not slip from hands). I got instant discount of 1000/- on buying it with HDFC card."
Worst product ever received .,1.0,"I have  received  a fully defective item, the mobile  is damaged  ,it has connectivity issues everytime, calls r disconnected automatically, I am even unable  to use my data, it cannot be connected to 5G wifi also , sound quality  is also harsh n irritating the ears. I have almost  complained 3_5 times but there's  no action taken by Amazon."
2nd time disappointed by choosing the brand.,1.0,1. Heavy may be due to 5k mah battery. There are better sleek phones in market with same battery capacity.2. I felt the Cameras are not good at all. Just 2x zoom distorts the picture. The 48mp camera is very cheap. 13mp redmi captures better pics.3. Screen is good and looks are ok.4. Taks approx 2.5 hrs for full charging.
Over all good phone at low  cost,5.0,"The phone cones with standard features and de wnt performance. As long as you that it as a mid /low range phone , you will be happy and satisfied with its performance.The battery life is good"
Samsung Galaxy M12 (Superb),5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Samsung gives us a great 👍product in this price range.1. Fast Fingerprint sensor.2. Good  Design.3. Battery 🔋performance is superb.4. Display quality 👌Awesome .5. Software performance is great. One UI is best. No Hangs or LagsOverall it full fill all  daily needs.Buy samsung . Samsung is Superb."
What a slow phone!,1.0,It's been 6 months since I've been using this phone. The slowest phone I ever used! It takes me about 10 - 15 seconds to dial a number. The touch response is slow and the system takes forever to respond to the command. I've used a number of same budget phones by other brands but never faced this issue. Very disappointed.
Amazing and Affordable!!,5.0,"I'm writing this review from the same phone that I ordered!! An amazing phone in an affordable price.. I ordered the one with 6GB RAM n 128 GB internal storage... overall it's working quite good for me ...it's been 10 days since I got my hands on this phone...fingerprint sensor is working great..battery life is awesome... speakers are working quite good.. n you get quad camera... camera is also pretty nice you just need to adjust the camera settings in order to get good quality pictures... it might not be 'the best' camera for many but it's good guys!!  Overall just go for this without any second thought.... even if you don't like it, Amazon eases your task with its 7 days replacement policy.... so it's not risky to order it online... good delivery service 👍🤗"
Phone Size,3.0,"The size of phone is big which is not easy to hold to hand even to keep in pocket, the weight is also more than 200gm and after add cover it will 250gm. Slow motion not in phone. All function are average. Value is good and simple phone"
Disappointed from samsung,1.0,"Dont buy if you are used to fast phones. Screen sensitivity is very poor. I think it is common in all samsung phones. Same i have in A71. My oppo is better then it.Ok phone , only brand name.(uchi dukan phike pakwan) their major focus is on promoting samsung apps not on phone performance."
Waste money..!!,1.0,"I am writing this review after the usage of 25 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues.  charging speed is very much disappointed , taking lot of time to charge up. The main issue I am facing is that the phone battery  is slow charging and quick battery draining.. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. 😡😡"
Camera quality. Donn't waste your money on M12,1.0,"Total waste of money. Worst camera quality. Front camera is not even like like 1 megapixel camera. If you like to take even a single selfi, then don't go for it. Back camera is also not at all good. My old Samsung phones are far better than this one. Once you buy you have to live with it. So, don't waste your money on this M12"
Mobile hotspot drops for every 20 minutes,3.0,I am writting this review after using this mobile for almost 2 months.When connected my laptop via mobile Hotspot through this phone it drops off for every 20 minutes. I have to restart the mobile then need to connect again. It is very annoying.I didn't have this problem with my previous mobile and also I don't have any coonectivity issues with my wife's mobile if I use mobile Hotspot on it. Mywife's mobile is lesser in configuration when compared to this mobile. We both have same mobile connection which is Vodafone.I don't know what to to do.
Pathetic smartphone from Samsung.,2.0,"Dont buy it ! go for other options. camera is poor like a 5k phone, brightness is poor, screen resolution is dull. overall this product does not worth more than 5k. I didnt expect this from samsung. i am a redmi user so i thought that i should give samsung one chance but i will never buy samsung smartphone ranging 10-20k in my life again."
Go for other options,2.0,"Go for other options, rather than going with Samsung, they just using brand name. Otherwise you won't find anything useful, in this price range you can buy much better mobile  of other company"
Please try to develop the battery and rear camera quality for customer's betterment.,4.0,"As a regular smartphone user i will rate this item 4 out of 5 because in such price it should be much better like in 48 mp camera the picture quality is not as good as my expectation. Fingerprint and face unloch is quite good and the selfie camera really excellent. As 6000mAh battery the battery should last upto 1day and a half but in standard use the battery quality decreases upto 29% in the evening (I charged the phone around 6.40 am on that day). This problem that I faced I had share with you all guys, before buying this phone please think a lot and tge decisions is completely upon you. Thank You, Arnab Bindu Chakraborty"
Waste of money,1.0,"Samsung thought Indian are foolish people, because this smartphone is waste of money,fon hang on first time used, very bad processor used,Please never buy Samsung smartphone under ₹20000/- they are just garbage."
Good to go,4.0,"Good to go piece.Few cons which I have noticed:• Specs may say camera megapixels are higher, but not in par with MI phones.• Cannot run dual apps for applications other than messenger.• Sudden issue arised in first week of use where speakers started screaming harshly with noise (trrrrrrrr) whenever some sound played(notifications, music). Luckily resolved after a reboot. (saw some other users having similar issues over support forum)"
M12 review.,4.0,"The phone received in a day. Thanks Amazon for quick delivery. The phone's display, camera, battery life is good. But one issue I found it. Recently I realize it that once I receive incoming call am not able hear it for couple of minutes / sometimes no voice heard from other side and finally I need to close the call ....initially I thought this issue should be from sender phone but now I realize it is in my phone...it appears that either there is problem in my phone or in model. Samsung and Amazon to look into this issue & replace it with good phone on immediate  basis."
Phone is too slow,1.0,"This phone is no different from other Samsung phones with respect to the usage speed. While the battery is fantastic, camera is ok. There too much lag while using phone. The worst thing is I noticed all these after my return period is over."
Do not fall for misleading marketing!!!,2.0,"Do not fall for mileading marketing and promotions. The phone started lagging right after setting it up and downloading the backed up data and apps. Avoid at all costs, the processor is the worst."
Budget mobile !,4.0,"Model : Samsung m12 6gb RAM 128 ROM (Black)Bought @ 10,350rsBattery life - 8/10Fingerprint, face recognition- 9/10Camera Quality-8/10Sound Quality- 6/10 (sound quality not expected)Ram and Processor - 8/10Cons:• Sound quality not up to the mark !• Somehow heavy• Camera quality is not so good• Data cable length is too short !• Fast Charging option didn’t  works well !

MIc is not working properly I already,2.0,MIc is not working properly I already bought M31 same problem with that mobile also .  My mistake is forgot that purchase and again same series phone since have good confidence over Samsung but they never maintaining good quality  . They need lot improvement over testing the product before launching in market
Please don't buy this product and don't buy from Amazon they r sending faulty phones,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Samsung phones usually hang everytime. I had this issue from other samsung phones like dual core and the service from Amazon is not good."
"Bad experience , avoid buying this",1.0,"When I received the mobile, neither the speaker nor the mic was working so I did a restart then it started working.This happened frequently so I had to restart frequently. I decided to replace the item as it was faulty but the new product I received has the same issue. Unfortunately this is not returnable so my money is wasted.Very bad experience, please avoid buying this."
Technical specifications not clearly mentioned that this mobile supports wifi band of 2.4 GHz,3.0,"Camera quality not up to the mark even having 48MP, battery life is good as of now. Finger print option is poor and wifi doesn't support above 2.4GHZ. Google play store and samsung app store both spoiling the android performance"
Not a best in class phone but a great phone in this budget.,4.0,"1. A good phone in this range2. Exynos 850 may not sound a great processor for gaming or multitasking, but it actually does a great job.3. No heating issues. (Playing games like FF for 1-2 hrs or attending consecutive meetings on Meet, Zoom & Teams or doing consecutive classes on Unacademy or Adda won't cause a problem)4. Although the camera quality disappointed me, as their remains a high expectation from Samsung Cameras.5. But overall Samsung lives upto its name, with great service centres and customer support."

Most Affordable Samsung Smartphone with Great Features In This Range,3.0,"This is the best smartphone Samsung has launched in this segment, I received it @12.5k with card offers, and its build quality is Ok, you will get the best features in this range, the camera is gooe, its very smooth in day to day normal use.It has a 6000mAh battery, which almost lasts for around 13-14Hrs in my case. It takes some time in charging, but if we see the battery size, it's normal.cons: you cant use s secure app to secure your  apps and folder, as its not compatible with this phone, and Samsung has compromised in many features.If you dont play heavy games, you can go with this."

Poor quality.,1.0,All the specifications mentioned for this item are wrong.Camera output seems like 8 MPFront camera is like 2 MPDisplay shows poor color. Feels like using low cost phone.Not recommended at all.
Not a good phone as expected,2.0,"I bought this phone before 2 months, Camera is very poor 48 MP it is poorer than 13 MP.I wanted to login my company email, before that device needs to be enrolled with Microsoft Intune company portal. The company portal will only allow when Device encryption feature will be available in phone, but it does not have.This is very important hardware features that secure your phone,s data.

Best Budget Segment Device for Samsung Lovers,5.0,"I got this as gift for my parents. Quality of this product is uncompromised, that doesn't surprise me cuz its Samsung.  What stood out in these few days in the battery life, it compliments their usage very well. Value for money deal for sure."
Okay.. not great.,2.0,"The touch is bad. The mobile is heavy. Battery is good. Also, fast charge. Camera is good outdoors. But, low light and indoor quality is not great. Overall, not bad. Okay for regular use. Not for photography or playing games"

A mediocre Made in India phone,2.0,I have been using this phone for last 2 weeks. I will start with the likes-Like:1. Made in india2. Looks decent3. Good battery lifeDislike:1. Irrespective of 6 GB RAM the phone feels slow with day to day usage. Even the basic contact search is slow.2. The phone is super heavy and thick.3. No dual band wifi. That means you are stuck with slow 2.4 GHz wifi.
Horrible Camera,1.0,"Very Horrible Camera , was totally disappointed with the camera , very poor camera and bad service by Amazon. which made my life miserable in exchanging this product. I have bought many mobiles earlier and now i will not buy from this site as exchange replacement is very difficult."
Nice phn at this price...!!,4.0,"Overall the mobile is great at this price, although screen is not as bright & speaker is just above average, not as loud as required. battery is very good and goes on for  more than one and half day easily..., camera is good and you can click some very good and bright photos. Overall good option in this price range ( best feature is it has 6gb ram, 128 gb internal memory at this price.)"
"Samsung M31 worst display, never buy this phone",1.0,"In almost one year, 3 times display screen has color leak issue (without any handset fall/physical damage) which company never covers under warranty. 3 times paid from my pocket Rs.4800 each time to rectify the issue. Highly disappointed with company poor development policy. Planned to never buy samsung products in future."
Value for money Mobile,3.0,"I am using this for more than a month as of now ....This is a very good Product at the price which Samsung is selling. It says it is MADE IN INDIA.I really like the Battery Backup for me it is lasting for more than 30 hours with moderate uses. Like ( Youtube ,  calling and Hotspot uses)COns : -It is Bulking and feels heavy in pocketFinger print scanner is not up to the mark .. some times it is unable to unlock ."
Don't go for exchange trick.,1.0,"Don't go for exchenge, it's a trip. They are expecting a brand new device which you could exchange. The intention of the Amazon delivery boy is like to found anything wrong in device and the price will deduct 70% to 80% from its original exchange ammount even it is well running. The attitude of the Amazon delivery boy is too rough and tough. It's my second horrible experience from Amazon end."
Worst ever from Samsung,1.0,"Touch is extremely bad and is irritating as it doesn’t recognize and hangs up.Have to lock and unlock several times to get other apps working.When phone is locked, despite double / triple tapping the screen, it doesn’t light up or show option to unlock, we have to press the side button yo light the screen which is more frustrating.Extremely slow even though it’s 4 gb ram"
Amazon hides that this phone does not support 5Ghz wifi.,1.0,Samsung hides the fact that this phone doesn't support 5Ghz wifi. The camera quality is terrible.My product arrived 1 hr ago and I am writing this review after setting up the device. The phone hangs and crashes when nothing other the default apps are present in the phone. Save yourselves the trouble and don't buy this.
Pathetic Product from Samsung,5.0,I had bought this phone for my mom and it had severe call quality issues from the beginning and within 6 months of using it the fingerprint stopped working. I checked with the service centre and they told me that the phone had liquid damage although it never had contact with water or rain. Stay away from this garbage.
Budget phone from Samsung,4.0,"Back to Samsung again after 8 years.Advantages-good handybudget good featuresbest UI user friendly..phone security system is good.Disadvantages -Samsung max app popup on lock screen while charging & Samsung pay mini app. We unable to UninstallFront and rear camera's are not good as expected 48mega pixel,charger cable length is very short compared to other brands."
Not worth of money,1.0,"13 to 14 k you will get better than this Samsung m12. The day I started use, phone started hanging,I should honestly give the reviewGo for other phone it doesn't give 6000mah woser than my old Lenovo phone 3500mah.Camera is average they give lots number of MP but not suited at all , only good thing is finger print senso even that too I doubt about it how long days I can have without problem.Finally I m not satisfied with M12, 6GB Ram phone is not working as the attractive description given below the list. Hopeless product"

most pathetic purchase ecer,1.0,i feel like cheated by amazon and samsung its not even a month and my phone stopped working with no reason this was not expected and visited to samsung centre as well but they were saying that only non warranty sets are getting fixed during this lockdown period then i asked them to fixed my set out of warranty (i was ready to pay as well) then they said that your mobile display is need to be change and there is no display available in India for my phone and from that day i am not having any smartphone as i am saving money and trying to bear this pain n loss.amazon hats off to u cheaters.

Just another smartphone under 10k. Nothing special.,3.0,Amazing battery life. Discharge is only 1% for overnight.Display can be much better. Expected a better display from samsung. Vivo and oppo have a better display interms of brightness and pixel density.Finger print on power button is good and quick.Plastic back is kind of disappointing.Overall performance is ok but not what the ADS on amazon show you.
"It still glitchy and not that good , I hated using the phone",1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 This phone display is weakReally week ...it falls one time ...and there it breaks ...now I don't believe in Samsung's quality at all ...it is worse than a Chinese phone .."
Great buy at the price,5.0,"We have recently purchased two of these phones, one by my brother and another for my father. I do not think there is a better phone than this for the price. Battery life and camera quality are standout features. I wholeheartedly recommend this phone to anyone planning to buy a new phone in this price range."
Awesome monster,5.0,"Review after 20 days use,Phones battery life is awesomeCan last all day, I charge once in couple of days,Wi fi calling working perfectly fineFingerprint and face unlock is fast enough,Overall it's Good phone in this price range"
It seems Samsung  has delivered  what they have been promoting in Galaxy M12,4.0,I got this phone for my second contact number as my primary handset  battery  runs out very fast and I usually have very long days. But this phone's battery  really  amazed me . It's only 3.5 days I am using  but I can tell you that the battery  backup  is really  good . My first full charge ran for full 3 days with moderate usage. Looks good . UI is simple with Android 11.  Weight and grip is good . Screen is responsive . Haven't faced a real show stopper as of yet . Initial opinion is full value for money for those who are looking for descent  phone with a very good battery  life.
Good phone,4.0,The phone is very goodBattery life is goodCamera is very goodTechnology is goodSamsung service is good for this good phoneOverall it a nice phone  but display quality is very poor  so this phone is good for in its price list.
Slow phone even with 6gb ram.,3.0,Phone is slow even with 6gb ram.Camera quality is okBattery good quality.Fingerprint scanner is very bad. 50percent times wont detect.Brightness is ok.Must apply screenguard. Otherwise feels dull.Basic budget phone. Nothing special.I got the 6gb 128gb for 11.5k so its ok
Slow touch response and hangs frequently,2.0,"I bought a new phone from Amazn and right from the time of setting up, the touch of the phone becomes unresponsive frequently. This is happening more on the lower side of screen - the back button and home button. Requires more than one touch to go to home page.Also there is a lag after touch - it takes some time before the screen appears. Poor quality"
Little bit more expecting from Samsung,3.0,Good battery and good fingerrint  sensor It's a average mobile almost important sensor are missing.Camera performance average actually i expected more quality from samsungDisplay also average..Storage 128GB and battery 🔋 6000 mah amazing...Also I'm  facing some heating issue when I am using mobile data on BSNL and while charging time💥💥💥.....
Not buy,3.0,I hope it is not a new one. It is renewed product. After  5 months  it's  performance is not good.  Phone is not running  smoothly and stuck some  times.  Screen apps also changes without  operating. Weight is high.
Review of this phone after using 2-3 months,4.0,"Everything is very good, specially display is very strong. Only two problems I am facing; 1. When I read some contents on a site for one or two hour, it often hangs. 2. When I use any UPI ID like GPay, Phone Pay or Bhim UPI, I don't face any problem when I enter the app first time by entering the passcode, but when I enter my passcode second time for the transaction, the numbers of keypad in blue colour, appear partially. These issues must be resolved."
"An ""also ran"" phone.",2.0,"Nothing extra ordinary about this phone. There are much better options in this price range.The battery is definitely good, and lasts more than a full day.However on the down side, the phone is very heavy, camera is ordinary and it feels sluggish to use."
Battery was super...,4.0,"Everything is good, battery backup was fantastic,but few problems need to fix. one is more weight, and while using phone pay, Google pay, key pad was showing broken numbers... I don't understand why it is happening.Remaining all are good and best phone in thus price range..."
Excellent product within this price range. Battery back up is unimaginable .,5.0,Samsung Galaxy M12 is an excellent handset. I am writing this review after of using the mobile for three weeks. The battery back up is unimaginable . Once it gets fully charged it runs for around 40 hours with frequent usage of internet. This set consists every unique feature that Samsung offers. The camera is good but not excellent. Nevertheless the sound of loudspeaker is little down. That is to say if the volume is not highest then it becomes a bit hard to listen.To conclude i would say that the configuration which this handset consists within this price range is just beyond imagination. This is an excellent handset Samsung launched.
Worst phone,1.0,"Please don't buy this...The data conctivity was really terrible...And I tried changing Sim card to my old phone..In old ph the data was connecting good and speed also good....And while I am in voice call, when I turn on the speaker only the other can hear my voice if I off speaker, they are unable hear my voice.Worest product!!!😢😢😢Please don't go with this!!!No screen recorder, no shortcut yo screenshot, but unwanted apps will download without our permission from galaxy store.Back camera is also not up to the mark!!!Very very bad experience!!!"
Super slow and bloated software,1.0,"Overall phone has too many bloated apps and the interface is super slow. Brand new phone seems like 5 year old phone. Battery is decent but doesn't give more than a day even without any work. I bought this phone for mom, after 4 months I'm buying a new phone her."
not even for a single star,1.0,"Samsung is simply cheating customers by booming the non credible features , the given features are just a paper tiger ( only for advertising ) don't misunderstand it will perform. it is just a budget phone nothing rather thanDon't think against the given features by Samsung . if you need a budget phone , can buy it else if you want a performance phone please Don'tOnly battery is good"
Phone quality is good.,5.0,Camera is okay not very good.Side button for finger print is not suitable when put inside a cover.As  the cover need to be opened everytime to place it on finger print reader.On an average the phone is working well.
M12 needs improvement otherwise J3 pro with 2 GB RAM was much better around 6000 price,4.0,Pl improve quality of this phone as after purchasing this phone people will not purchase Samsung Phone again.Phone is good for initial purchaser as speed is not upto mark. 4 GB RAM is not looking strenghting phone working. Also speaker sound is very bad as compare to Samsung other phone.
Absolute waste of resourses.,1.0,"Regretful encounter wth this M12 order , dated 14 th Aug '21.Gifted this product to my sister, it's been just 3 mths today. Display not working, unable to start n poor battery performance.Showed at Samsung gallery for review they said mother board needs to b changed whc will cost 8 k.Please do justice to the lil investments we make around.Kindly oblige, acknowledge n respondNeed full replacement to consider.Team Amazon n collabs."
Worst front camera quality,3.0,Please dont buy if u r expecting good camera quality in this phone...i mean its below below below average...not at all good...Overall phone is good in this range but expected a lot better from samsung.. this mobile should be sold in 7k not more than that...
Monster,4.0,"Battery backup super,Camera quality well... But the macro option worst... Selfi just low quality..Processing speed good...some specification are like to 6000rs mobile phone...Face lock, fingerprint lock are very quickly working...Overall it is monster..."
Good mobile phone in this range,4.0,"Good mobile, But sorry to inform you that at the time of the order I thought that the model is F12, but the picture of the mobile is same as M12.  That was a mistake to understand about model. So please ignore the privious review & forgive me."
Worst experience of smartphone,1.0,Writing this review after 3 months of usage. I bought this for my mom. She is not a heavy user. Only handful of apps installed. Touchscreen becomes unresponsive very frequently. Imagine you are trying to type something or click on some message to read it and then you ha e to press 10 times for it to work. Never expected samsung to make such cheap quality smartphone.
"Does not support higher WiFi band width 5.0 Ghz, so users won't get higher Wifi speed",1.0,"There is no option for WIFI 5.0 Ghz in this phone. Now-a-days almost all of us have dual band Wifi router in our homes/offices. But this phone will only work with lower speed and lower bandwidth 2.4 Ghz. It cannot detect the higher bandwidth 5.0 Ghz, so you won't get higher Wifi speed"
Good phone in this price range . Better than Chinese phones,5.0,"Nice product from samsung . I purchased it a few weeks back from Amazon with nice offer and exchange offer . Phone is great for daily routine task . I am using banking with Knox security and never felt any disappointments regarding this.It is not for gaming purpose . It's a value for  money ,good battery life , nice big screen , moderate camera for daily purpose.  Overall it's 5 out of 5 from my side.I wold like to say thanks to Amazon to give a reliable service ."
WORST CAMERA CLARITY AND WORST MOBILE PERFORMANCE.,1.0,"Samsung M12.  Camera clarity is absolutely worst and bad normal Camera phone is better than  ,And  mobile is  getting over heated  badly  in all times when Iĺ operate, over all Samsung M12 performance is not good.i purchased this mobile for camera purpose. I just blindly trusted Amazon before buying Samsung M12, now in not happy with this.One of ""Best Worst mobile"" in Samsung series.Amazon thought me very  good lesson, purchasing mobile from them, never ever I won't purchase anything in Amazon , By these Amazon heir trusted  and confidence.  🙏🙏🙏 Thanq."
Great brand. Great buy,5.0,"Good quality from a very reputed time tested brand. Purchased inAmazon sale. Got a bargain. Add to this - credit card discount, and interest free EMI.Thank you Amazon.  Thank you Samsung."
Very Good For Normal Users,4.0,"The Phone is best for middle range buyers,Negative in phone means 1000/2000 price has to reduce because of their given features .And remaining over is fine with mid rangeFingerprint is fastBattery is very goodCamera back is okay but front 8mp is some what good (because of this price has to reduce)Processor is not good for gamers.,This phone is very good to who use very less .,or normal users .  Like only calls msgs and social networks chatting.If you want camera good means don't buy this phone.Screen resolution is less due to that HD videos were not in original some what blur or like below HD."
"Worth evey penny, good budget phone",5.0,"I like the focus mode, that helps to keep apps that are needed active to avoid unwanted notifications to distract ones work. Dark mode and eye protection is also good feature that protects eye. Inbuilt Smart mode helps detect the fraud/spam calls without any external app installation. Camera quality is good with good zoom capability. Phone is light and slim with good responsive touch sensor. Overall Phone is very good for my purchase budgetof Rs9500."
Unhappy,1.0,"I have received the product today but as mentioned box in the details while purchasing in the box available hand set,manual, ejection pin,adopter. In the box only I have received hand set and adopter, not received the manual and ejection pin. Without ejection pin how should I put my SIM card in my mobile. I am very unhappy with that. Still I am not checking the other details in the phone. I am rated 1 star out of 5 bcoz of above issue. First impression is best impression here I am not seen very in happy."
The brand caring for all ysers,4.0,"This is my solid rankingafter using Galaxy M12 for a fortnight.Ovweall performance is quite good and comfortable.It would be better if atleast 25 w charger is provided with a big battery.Some critics on you tube had informed "" 4 to 5 problems"" in all(?) M series phones but I have found none of them in this product although it is of very reasonable price.I am 85 today and yet enjoy my ph. Without any difficulty.SAMSUNG has never any excuse|!"
Good phone for basic usage,5.0,"It is a good phone if usage is limited to calls, whatsapp and YouTube.. battery life is excellent.. actually lasts for 2 days.. camera qualityis reasonable..Fingerprint reader is in the power button, which takes time to get used to.. haven't tried any gaming apps"
It doesn't have dual band wifi,2.0,What the Samsung India it doesn't have basic dual band wifi in this price range even smartphone around 8 thousand in the market have dual band wifi these days. This is ridiculous that you guys haven't even mentioned this on the product description page. It shows your insecurity and disloyalty against your customers. This was not expected from samsung ridiculous.
Overlall Good Phone in This budget  range against Chinese phones 👍,4.0,"The Phone is Nice, Mai 3 din se use kr rha hun ye phone aur ye phone thik thak kaam kr rha hai Maine heavy games  bhi khele isme high graphics  me wo bhi thik chale, overl all mai agar dekhun to iss range me ye phone samsung ka hote huve bhi Chinesebrand ko iss budget me takkar deta hai aur  android  11 ka experience  bhi dekhne ko mil rha hai jo ki badhiya lga mujhe.》》But ek cheez mujhe jada disappoint kiya aur wo hai eska 48mp ka camera isme eski quality  aur behtar kr skte the jo ki true 48mp ki tarah pic ki quality  nhi deta Samsung  brand hote huve bhi aisa thik nhi hai."
Truly Worth to Buy This Reloaded Monster - Samsung M12,4.0,Samsung is truly a Monster with 6000 mAh battery with 8 nm processor. 128 GB Internal memory is really good to have along with 6 gb RAM where the games r loading very smoothly. True 48 Mp quad camera is truly wise to capture the photos. The phone is very slim and 90 hz refresh rate is really awesome. 16.55 cm infinity V display is cool. In total this mobile is one of the best to have at this range of prices. Moreover the backside of the phone is having a matte finish which is very good and not slippery.
Performs much better than was expected after reading the reviews.,5.0,"Camera quality is good if compared to other phones in this range. Phone feels really fast, thanks to the 90Hz screen and 6gb RAM with a fast processor. I bought in under exchange offer for 10,000 ( 6gb variant ) and I am quite satisfied with my purchase. Go for it if you are tight on a budget yet want a phone with good specs. Much better than similar budget Chinese phones. But note that front camera could have been better, although it is 8mp but still gives grainy images. Phone was delivered in perfectly new condition."
"Touch, Microphones Issues in 2months of usage.",1.0,"Touch, Microphones Issues in 2months of usage.Low quality.I love samsung flagship phones which have good quality make. But budget phones are so bad. Low quality make."

 I sold a phone last month but there is some problem in this phone, I requested to pickup this phone but didn't pick up. I called to Amazon customer care many times frequently says pick up next three days but vain. So I am disappointed 😞. I didn't phone or money refund."
Fully satisfied with the Mobile,5.0,"Buy for My Father & He is Soo Happy..,Better than Chinese Mobiles in the market..., Go for samsung,Overall mobile looks to performance 5/5#Avoide Chinese Mobiles (Realme,mi,Oppo,Vivo,OnePlus,....)"

Best phone with Samsung security and no  blotware. UNLIKE Redmi which is full of blotware,5.0,This is a great product from Samsung. Really Monster. Battery is huge . Response of phone is very good. Touch is smooth. 90 hz screen give a smooth look on fast changing graphics . Camera of the phone is excellent  in the prize tag. Battery and display deserves 7 stars.
Not a great phone,2.0,Not sure If its a good phone....I have bought it but its not working properly... throwing a lot of errors....many times calls are not going through even with full signal sometimes after call disconnected there is a strange sound which continues to ring and i have to switch off the phone....If anyone has some idea please suggest
Battery life Awesome,5.0,Battery life is very good. Built quality is also very nice. Camera quality also very good. Fingerprint reader work perfectly and also fast. Overall the phone is very good. Value for money. One of the best choice this phone in this price range.
Budget mobile,5.0,Its Samsung branded busget gudget ...camera is so so...little heavy..2000 per month for 6 months...again i will purchase a new one with some good feature..its not having any unique feature. Very simple but dimple...
Good phone but cheap plastic. Back panel vibrates on phone.,3.0,"3 months use review - no voice recording tool, no screen video capture tool, it's usually available on any cheap phone. Samsung says these are available on higher end models, who is a snob?Given 3 stars overall just because of the plastic at the back, during the call it vibrates  cheap plastic casing otherwise phone works fine. Other phones cheaper than this have better casing but then...."
Worth Money Smartphone,4.0,"Using it from last 8 months, worth it totally 👍 used iPhone earlier and then bought this phone, one thing noticed is battery life, no comparison at all with iPhones, way better than iPhones and many smartphones of this range.Second one is Screen resolution, top quality.Third pro is storage, better than iPhone.Camera is average compared to iPhones and other smartphones so if you want good smartphone with good battery life, storage, screen resolution then must go for this phone. Totally worth it in this criteria"
Good value for money,4.0,"Got this as a replecement for my samsung M11. The M12 is way better than M11. Better photo quality, better performance and faster performance. I got the blue phone which looks decent as well. I feel it's worth the 13500 I paid for it."
Best device under 10k segment from SAMSUNG.,5.0,Display is HD+ with TFT panel but it doesn't feel like TFT rather it feels IPS LCD HD+ panel! Good move Samsung! But other brands providing IPS LCD FHD+ 90hz in this 12k segment from Other brands! But initially it's good.
Good battery backup,4.0,Good phone for those who use it only for calling and other common use. not suitable for those who wish to take photos as its camera quality is just ok. Good battery backup as it claims
Nice product worth buying,5.0,"I ordered this product on 20 July 2021 and immediately it got delivered within a week on 29 July 2021.Mobile camera is good.Battery is betterPerformance and storage is goodOverall it's good mobile for normal android usersThis review is not for  users who play high end games (like ping, free fire etc) in mobile"
15k features in 10k amazing...,5.0,Phone is fabulous and it is worth for those who r looking the budget phone .All features are loaded un customise manner in this phone. One should nit go for 15k range phone of all features are available in 10k..Think wisely...
Mic Quality in video is extremely bad.,1.0,Mic Quality in video is extremely bad. Cannot explain how bad it is... I ordered 2 phones at my home... both of them have this same issue. Samsung needs to address this immediately. I don't want to talk about other features as this is budget phones. But never seen such a bad quality from this or lower price range.
Samsung brand,5.0,Only bought it for the samsung brand value .My nephew was very adamant about it . And he is happy with the phone. And he dropped the phone like 2times already.
Average phone at this range,2.0,"Average phone at this range, phone gets hanged while using some basic apps. Battery life is ok doesn't seem like 6000mah which makes phone heavy , camera quality is average. Only best thing  about the phone is its look.All together I feel you can get a better phone at this price"
Camera quality is so pooooor,2.0,"I don't know why they have mentioned as 48 mega pixel , I am big fan of Samsung.Prior to this mobile I have used Samsung j6 its just 13mega pixel camera quality is just awesome. M12 camera quality is very poooooor.One more issue is Amazon not accepting return until if you receive a defective piece."
Battery Backup is awesome. Straight 2 days for only calls.,5.0,I liked the battery backup of the phone and performance is so far good as it is being used by my parents. BEST phone for parents. Takes 2 hours to go from 0-100%. And please don't buy this phone if you are photogenic or require gaming efficiency
Worst Amazon service and samsung product,1.0,"We received mobile on 11 Jan 2022, we raise an issue with the mobile on the same day..The veecare technicians inspected the mobile and found issue with  gprs, slowlesness , touch screen ...They said thy ll replace the mobile, because they don't have any option of refunding it.No refund nor replacement yet ..Our money for more than a week with them ..no proper reponse nor info provided an appI demand Amazon to refund the money"
ACKO's Screen Protection Plan,5.0,"ACKO's Screen Protection Plan!- When i purchased this mobile for my mother, i got an email from ACKO Team that ""Your mobile is now protected by ACKO's Screen Protection Plan!"" After a month mobile fell down  from my mom hand unfortunately.  I contacted ACKO team after that, they told me to send my Screenscratch /damage video with details and credited money to repair my phone screen. Really appreciate Amazon and ACKO team on this."
This one really affordable and great facilities.,5.0,I used in and really the feelings was great. It is smooth no hang or down occours. Storage and new camera facility was just good and little bit mora upgarde to the camera needed I think 'Slow motion operation '. Over experience was great. You all have to try it once. For gamers it may little not good as the processor is getting some lapse while using heavy games.My experience was best because with this amount the mobile provides a lot.
"Raw phone, Processing speed is really low",1.0,"The processing speed is pathetic, even when i didint i stalled most basic applications. Not a Worth product for this price range."
"Worst Seller, Fake offer",1.0,"I have purchased this phone with 6 months screen replacement, but when I need to use the offer neither amazon or the seller (Savex) it responding, amazon saying to contact seller but seller not responding at all and samsung saying no plan is activated on the phone IMEI. Dont go with this fake offer by the seller"
Good,5.0,"The phone is very good, the phone's battery is very strong, which gives a battery backup of three to four days, if you only do calling and RAM management is good, fingerprint sensor very fast.Overall quality smartphone."
असंतोषजनक,1.0,इस फोन में कई कमियां है जैसे इसकी नोटिफिकेशन ट्यून बंद करने पर भी नोटिफिकेशन आने पर बजती है।इसको चार्ज़िंग पर लगाने और फोन के चार्ज होने का कोई भी संकेत नहीं मिलता है।नोटिफिकेशन से सम्बंधित प्रकाश संकेत इसमे उपलब्ध नहीं है जिससे स्क्रीन लॉक होने पर नोटिफिकेशन की जानकारी नहीं हो पाती है।भार में भी ये अन्य फोनो से काफी ज्यादा है।कैमरा तो चार चार है पर पिक्चर की गुणवत्ता संतोषजनक नहीं है।वाई फाई की रेंज बहुत ही कम है एक दीवार के बाद डाउनलोड की स्पीड अत्यंत कम हो जाती।
Good Mobile within its price range,5.0,"Bought the Samsung M12. Good purchase. Worth the price.Likes:1. Exceptional Battery backup2. Fast processing for Game Play3. Good Display clarity4. Very responsive Biometric sensors, especially Face RecognitionNot so Good Camera clarity especially during night time in artifical light. Also, the speaker sound could have been louder."
For slow user it is a good phone,3.0,"Camera ia average, but for decent activity this is really a good buy. Current 6gb varient is available for 10500 after applying offers is a great deal you can definitely buy it. But not for heavy users."
"Good Mobile in Low budgets , but still have some Issues.",3.0,"Well It's Good Budget Mobile, Display Quality Good , Battery life is long , performance also ok, Even built Quality Are also fabulous.But Camara Quality is Average , Even camera have less option to Capture Images, means this samsung mobile don't have a Slow Motion video, micro camera , HDR etc.So this mobile is Failed in Camera quality."
UI Totally waste.,2.0,Worst UI experience from samsung.1. Basic app lock setting missing.2. Data disconnected while in a call.3. While using Amazon custome care chat keyboard hide the typed content.4. SMS selects the recent caller option missing.5. You can't off the alarm for one particular day. You have to off then on the alarm again.5. Unnecessary samsung apps occupy the space which you not even open in your lifetime.
Great user experience,5.0,"Using Samsung smartphone after many years. But have to admit samsung smartphones improved a lot as compared to TouchWiz days. Performance, camera are very good on this device. Battery life excellent. All features functions as intended to be. No bugs in software. User experience is really great. Delighted with this purchase."
it is good👍👍🏻,5.0,"Good in this segment because of more RAM & storage, but it's very heavy and thick, i mean it's not light weight. it can also hang if you don't follow the peoper rule of using mobile phone"
Rough ang Tough model,5.0,"Writing this review after using three weeks...Samsung introduced superb model, quite heavy.... battery life superb... finger sensor work exllent but not true HD display....camera is average...but okay...for simple users it excellent and also recommend for rough users.....all over it is value for money..."
Good phone at 10K budget,4.0,Its a decent phone for basic use at 10K price point. Screen & Camera quality are excellent. Overall little heavy in weight phone though.
pathetic buying,2.0,"Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.Heating problem. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one."
Best buy,5.0,"Wonderful purchase. I got it for 9499. Amazing budget phone, camera is decent and touch sensitivity is good. Battery life is good but it starts to slow down with usage.There is not lagging yet. Fingerprint is prompt in action, but they need to work on the face unlock.If you have a normal usage, with no gaming, this phone is for you. Its a steal deal!!!"
"Value for money, Brand value",5.0,"The purpose behind my purchase is accidentally my Samsung A10 fell down and lost the display, so immediately I have selected this model without any second thought, because of the brand value, value for money, features, user-friendly what not all features.  We are happy with this purchase and the way we received our order very timely."
Worth buying. Value for money,5.0,This phone is having all good features and it's finger print reader and face recognizing is working super.Sound and battery  life is goodCamera superAnd all other phone feature are compare to 30k+ ir provided in thisA big thanks to Samsung...loving it.
30 seconds of high lag,1.0,"One star for SUPER LAG. Phone becomes dead slow. Camera, calling has lag of atleast 15 seconds. Tried all types of antivirus, booster, even restarted the phone several times. Works fine after restart for couple of minutes.Might be a defective piece. No return policy available."
Not worth...don't have enough basic features...6000 mah I doubt it,1.0,"Biggest disappointment is this latest phone  ,not able to connect to 5g, even my old moto phone am able connect to 5g wifi...also see the numeric pad display ... battery life average...check if I can replace it with other model"
An awesome budget mobile,5.0,I am using this mobile for more than 3 monthsEverything is perfect for this priceAn awesome budget mobileIt can run all the games on high settings at 60fps I have played call of duty free fire and bgmi of max settings with 60fpsVery good mobile
Mobile performance is above average 90hz refresh rate? If u r buying the mobile,1.0,"Got the mobile on the launch date,Battery must be appreciatedCamera is just averageMobile performance is above average90hz refresh rate? If u r buying the mobile for this feature then I'm afraid u may get disappointed, it's just normal.The USB cable is too small in lengthIt's a good mobile in this budget, there are no returns for this, only replacement is available, hence choose wisely before buying"
Mobile for parents,4.0,Good bettry life so mobile is bit heavy.Not a best camara but fine in this range and its not 48MP totally fake.Overall good for parents who needs bettry life and not photoholic.
Not worth the wait,1.0,Old school storage type with a interior processor. Phone is heavy and weight distribution is not that great. Charger is slow. Definitely u can't term a 15W charger as a fast charger. Phone is good for general usage.
Not a Bad Phone at this price Range.. However expected better camera quality from Samsung,3.0,"Expected better camera quality from Samsung.. Camera Quality is total waste.. Battery life is good. Side Fingerprint not so good, quick and responsive. But manageable..Not a Bad Phone at this price Range.. Neither satisfied , not too much disappointed.I felt I could have bought Techno 7000 Mah phone because of big Brand Samsung I bought it during the Prime Day Deals.."
Camera Quality and Colour +Performance,1.0,"Worst Samsung Mobile Ever. used so many different Samsung mobiles. but M12 is just cheating by Samsung. The camera quality is so poor. It's just a VGA camera, not 48-megapixel screen colors are very low. I have a galaxy j8 its camera is lower than m12 but it is sharp. don't take they will not return the product. worst Samsung phone ever. lost 13500, and amazon service is being poor day by day."
Budgeted phone,4.0,Camera quality good but photo click krne me time bahut lagta.... what's app pr 1 sath 2 camera photo send nhi hoti....10 photos send krni hai(camera wali) to 1 -1 krke hi send krni hogi...battery life super se uper....jb ko mere mobile me na to memory card na hi koi Jada phone data...Phil bhi camera slow.song full volume pr 1dm se high ho Jata hai jb ki 1 point km Kate hi sunai hi nhi deta
Average experience,3.0,"At this price, I expect atleast a little better phone. First of all, the processor is slow and lagging. The camera quality is very bad. I mean ""very"" bad so think about what are the essential things you definitely need before buying. Battery life is fine. Look is average because its quite thick than other models. Overall, I think its okay for general purposes but not a good phone to have."
M 12 review,4.0,"Speed is OK for working, since it is 6 GB RAM. Battery is very good. Display is  also, OK. For doing normal data processing work lime share trading, for using excel, Word.., small types of editing,  ...., this system is enough, but if you intend shooting , its not enough.  Camera is not seems 48 MP. Front camera is OK."
"Worthy, but very heavy and some issues with this product",3.0,"Worth for money, but this is very heavy which is very uncomfortable for me, but it have best noise cancellation which i like more....... And if you can use UPI then its keyboard button cut halfly which is worst of this phone........ Due to Its heaviness and UPI problem i can't recommend you to buy this phone"
Best for Gifting,4.0,Lovely 4 camera design though no 5ghz wifi and 90hz don’t know what’s the difference between normal or this. But overall at this price point loaded. Better than Chinese. Yes of course Unnecessary apps could be reduced that come preinstalled.
A total package with limitations,4.0,"At this cost, this phone is awesome. Camera, Screen, Battery everything is awesome. However, on careful inspection some sensors are missing when compared to Xiaomi and other Chinese brands."
"6 months free warranty is a fraud, don't buy it from amazon",1.0,"I have purchased this on 6th sep with 6 months free screen replacement. My phone screen broke in a month and when i go back to samsung service center, they denied for screen replcement. Also samsung customer care is saying amazon will do it. Amazon is saying samsung will do it.They are making fool of customers."
Best M series phone till date!,5.0,"It’s a beast phone with a huge battery.The UI is also very simple and the screen is very lively.Camera is good ( but could’ve been better)At this price point, can’t really complain though - performance is also really for a phone priced under 15,000."
Great budget phone,4.0,"Overall it's the best phone for the price range. Battery life is a blast, sometimes I can go without charging for 2 days on a 2-3 hour screen time. If you start the day at 100, after heavy use you will still be left with the battery at the end of the day.The camera is pretty good too, but not great. I'd say a 4/5 for the camera.The phone is kinda heavy if you are not used to heavy phones then take care for the first 1-2 weeks."
Warranty issue,3.0,I have purchased a samsung M12 mobile and 6 months free screen replacement warranty added for prime member at that I am also prime member so this benefit added.After 2 week mobile was Fall down and screen was damaged.So I went to samsung service center and claim the warranty but my mobile insurance plan was not activated so you will be bay and change the screen.Last 25 days I am try to activate my plan but problem was solved upto date.So please solve the problem quickly
It's ok ok at this price range,4.0,Am using M21 from past one year then I ordered this can say M21 is better then M12 design and display but it's also good not bad
Great budget phone,4.0,"Great phone replacement for my 30k Oneplus 3T with only few issues like samsung bloatware which I tried to uninstall/disable as much as possible, a little on the heavy side (probably because of large battery) and the phone itself feels too big for one hand use but there were very few small phone options in budget section. Overall, great phone."
Amazing smartphone with great battery backup.,5.0,Display is not that great.Battery is awesome.Camera quality is better than other chinese handsets.Samsung one ui coupled with android 11 experience is superbb. You will love it.Fingerprint reader and face unlock works fast.Speaker is loud also.Exynos chip is underperform slightly than the competion but considering it's a Samsung budget phone so overall it's worth the purchase.
Good phone for user with less speed requirements.,3.0,A phone working good with all app except high end gaming app or some high processor occupied apps. Phone get switched off automatically on high processor usage when multi app functioning. Good at 8.5k price.Camera quality very good without zoom. Very bad with full zoom. Same with selfi cam.Networking : zero problems till now.Rest is good till now in last 1 month from i bought.
Awesome battery,5.0,"After a long usage of this phone almost 7 months, battery is very good, phone is little bit on the heavier side. But for this price it's a wonderful product"
Beast at best price,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Good phone at this price segment... We love samsung from the beginning and hence choose to get this mobile again as usual samsung is best for its camera, battery and processorKeep giving such budget phones to people"
Don't buy this phone,1.0,The camera is of very poor quality.Screen disply quality is not good as redmi phone don't buy this phone.I will never purchase any Samsung phone in future.Samsung is only doing marketing launching new products every day but quality of the product are very poor.I replaced the redi phone if you used the redimi phone you will never satisfied with Samsung.
Awesome Mobile,4.0,After one month of using . Phone is too good . Apps can be shuffle so fast i.e speed is good. In price range it's best . Samsung touch sound camera almost fine .No prob. Till Now
Best mobile in this category at 12k by every angle.,5.0,"Best mobile in this category at 12k by every angle. I mean display,  camera,  sound,  connectivity,  features, updates & securities etc.Overall you could assume ""Indian IPHONE """
Very heavy...thick ...brick,2.0,UPI payments are slow as keypad doesn't fit in the screen and touch is very slow....I've a S10+ and iPhone both hv no such issues..
Best Phone from samsung in this range.,5.0,"Go for this if you want samsung brand and trust.Don't waste your money on chinese phones, samsung nis far better than other brands..Also In this you will get One UI core version but samsung doing amazing job with it's UI and implementation..Battery life is awesome..Recommended phone.."
If you want battery phone this is the best phone,4.0,Phone touch is smooth doesn't hang and heat battery life is best and charges fast problem with this phone is camera quality they say it's 48mp but it feels like 13mp fingerprint sensor onside is very inconvenient they must have placed it on the back and the phone is very heavy
Useless Service from Amazon,1.0,I always think 10times before I order anything expensive from Amazon because I have got a bad product. But this time dont know why I didn't give a thought. This model of Samsung M12 was available in Amazon only and guess what I received manufacturing defective piece. Seems like Amazon is pleasing customers by making things available in advance which turn out to be defective. Samsung also does not take responsibility of replaceling their defective piece with a new one.
overall good phone,4.0,"does not have bloatware which are found in other brand like Mi. but have its own bloatware. overall good performance, not very fast, battery life is great and camera is also above average."
Not as expected,2.0,"Think twice before you buy the same. Redmi/Realme phones offers much better specs in this price bracket.Samsung mobile having Exynos processor is known for its lagging performance when compared with those having much lower spec SnapDragon processors. Here same case with M12 also.The only reason for which I recommend M12 is, It comes with Android 11 out of the box and latest One UI also it's built quality."
पैसे की बर्बादी है ये मोबाइल,2.0,घण्टा true 48 megapixel कैमरा है !!!🔔🔔🔔🔔कैमरे की क्वालिटी 2G के समय जो चाइना फोन आते थे उसके 2 mp के जैसी है ।फोन में दमदार बैटरी के अलावा कुछ भी नही है ।इस प्राइस रेंज में दूसरे मोबाइल इससे ज्यादा फीचर और अच्छी क्वालिटी में मिल जाते है ।पता नही क्यो अमेज़ॉन कस्टमर रिव्यू में ज्यादातर लोगों ने 1 स्टार दिया है फिर भी अमेज़न इसको ओवरऑल 4.5 स्टार क्यो दिखाता है !!
"Failed in 3 weeks, Service centre do not have requisite parts",1.0,"I purchased M13 on 23rd July and its ear speaker stopped working in less than 3 weeks. Today when I took it to authorised service centre, they confirmed the problem and held it until the part is available with them for repair, with no definite timeline. I so wish this problem had shown up a week earlier, so that I could have received a replacement."
Average Mobile,4.0,"Download is very low , when you pouch fingerprint is working some difficult. When you restart the mobile is show's android is starting like first power On. It's average mobile. It's fine for normal use."
Faulty product delivered,1.0,Faulty product has Black and white screen.Returned on next day but after 8 days also the cash is not refunded. Customer care says wait fo 15 days!!!
Awesome Mobile 📱 from samsung,5.0,"One of the best mobile from Samsung. They named it as monster battery, but it's a truly monster battery lasts upto 2 day's. Look wise it is beautiful, mobile is some what it is feeling heavy due it's monster battery. Though senceor is smooth. Handling the mobile is very easy. Camara quality is awesome. Overall the product of the Samsung is a top notch mobile."
Disappointed,1.0,"1. Some features, importantly 'Screen shot', not available.2. Poor battery life.3. Slow.I will never recommend Samsung mobiles."
DEFECTIVE PHONE DELIVERED,1.0,"SCREEN GOT BLANK JUST AFTER 9 DAYS OF USE.  AT THE TIME OF PURCHASING(25 SEP 21) IT WAS A AMAZON'S CHOICE PRODUCT, BUT TODAY(05 OCT 21) IT IS NOT. SO, IT'S CLEAR THAT amazon's choice TAG IS BEING USED TO CLEAR THE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS WITH THE SUPPORT OF LUCRATIVE OFFERS. I HAVE BEEN CHEATED."
Phone is Extravagently cool and strong.,5.0,"Everything is very good som people said processor is not good but it's absolutely very epic it can handle any task also I didn't use it for gamingoyher than that video editing is great and battery can stand upto 2days if not use very hardly, it has a great battery , camera is fabulous also galaxy apps give u boost in every way hence this phone is very fabulous under 10K, Hence Proved."
Not up to mark,1.0,"6Gb,128 GB phone was much slow than my old phone of 2Gb, 32Gb.Don't go by specifications only, performance not matching for this model.Thanks to Amazon for returning the product."
Not very impressive,2.0,Below average phone in this price range. Battery lasts only 24hrs with very normal use. Camera is below standards. Processor is not very impressive. Mi Note 10 would have been a better choice.
Battery charge time is 2.5hrs. This is extreme.,4.0,"Battery is good, camera is decent, display is okayish because of 90hz refresh rate, processor scores pass mark if the user is senior citizen.Battery charge time is 2.5hrs which is insane. Too much of apps in background will slow down the phone dramaticallyOverall if you are buying a phone for your parents and have an ease of mind in having a samsung phone, then go for it. It won't bite."
Value for money,5.0,"Best features in this range of a trusted brand, but if you need the best bunch of back cameras and a good selfie camera(it has 1 48 mp camera with 5,2,2 mp complementary cameras and 5mp front camera which is not best), go for galaxy m32 with 3-4k rs more, also it was made in india"
Good mobile in this range,5.0,"As Samsung shows its quality in every launch, this is also a good product in mid range mobiles. All things are good if u r an average user, for high performance gaming & photography other high end models are preferred."
Overall review,4.0,A good buget phone with great battery life.I usually use it for gaming because I can't buy a gaming phone it to expensive. But I can play seemingly all kind of game without lag(I dont mean games like genshin imapact).Overall goodValue for money:8/10 (reason low resolution  comparedd to other  budget smart phone  under 12000)Camera:9/10 (under this price tag the camera  qualityy is good)Chipset:8/10(under this price tag)Battery:10/10(best in this price tag)Overall:7/10
Great for home use or small office. 4gb ram is bit slow for processing.,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Everything is Ok for me, Processor atleast need 6 gb ram as the multiple application will not slow down the phone. Otherwise great phone with huge battery, I almost use it for 3 days without charger (my use is for office use)."
Worst Phone,1.0,"One of the worst Samsung phone. It should be called ""Brick"" instead of phone. So heavy and bulky.Camera quality is third grade.Most of the effects from Instagram won't be supported. Truly a waste mobile. Do not buy this brick."
So heavy weight..,1.0,"Now am writing this using after 20 days Samsung M12 phone is  not smooth little slow, Camara like 5mp.. not clear screen tuch not good feel like used mobile.. am suggesting don't buy you this one you can get other good phones in this price range."
Very bad,1.0,"Fingerprint doesn’t respond well.Battery life very good.Net very slow, sometimes net is totally disconnected  automatically although its not fault of network system. Overall,  a very very bad phone. Dont buy it.. If you bought it,  it will make you mad and irritating man."
Overall Satisfaction with M12 phone,4.0,"I wanted to have a phone 6 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM and 7000 mAH battery with large display and good picture quality in budget. This phone has satisfied me a lot, however this phone has 6000 mAH battery. I am much satisfied now. After one year or more than one year, It should not be slow and hang. I will rate this phone 8 number out of 10.However it's a better deal."
"If you are taking money, you need to be honest on your product promises.",1.0,"Handset is likeable, no doubts. But the quality of display, camera and processor are not full in criteria as mentioned. I have sent a picture captured by 48 mp resolution, you will see that is not clear and  proof that the quality of camera is not good. Display resolution shows to see the diaplay you need to tilt the phone. Sometimes phone went hanged also so that the processor is not good. I have exchanged my old phone which was in well running condition now I am missing that was best against this one. That was solid in his promises. Thankyou"
Best with all feature at affordable price,4.0,"At the price of rs.9499 this Samsung Galaxy M12 is am superb smartphone with the features of 48mp camera, 6000 mah battery,  90 Hz refresh rate, processsor based on 8nm, type-C etc. Because of affordable price this smartphone help to new begginer to reach at the world of technology. Due to other brand offer more price and also gives less features this smartphone comes a step ahead."
Excellent mid range budget phone,5.0,The phone is a good one to use. It is a 6.5 inch but is handy to use for its balance. It has a 6000 mah battery which gives it a great battery backup with a decent fast charger. It has also a good UI( One UI 3.0). Overall it's a good smartphone which can beat some flagship phone too.
"Google pay ,phone pay are not compatible  with this phone",2.0,"Fingerprint reader not worked properlyIf you unlock  you device 10 times its perfectly  work only 6 times*PHONE PAY* GOOGLE  PAY * NOT WORKING IN THIS DEVICE ,WHEN YOU ENTER  PASSWORD  ITS OVERLAPPED, YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO SEE WHAT ARE YOU ENTEREDI PURCHASE M12 IN APPROX 25 SEPTEMBER  AND WITH IN 2 WEEKS PRICE DOWN BY 2000RS ,ITS SHOWS THAT PRODUCT IS TOTALLY  FLOPED NOW SAMSUNG  JUST CLEARED THE STOCK."
Slooooooow 👎,1.0,"You will get frustrated by how slow it is. It's slower than my 3 year old MI phone I no longer use. Don't go for average 4 star rating on Amazon, take my words, any ₹6000 phone would perform better than this."
Heavy,5.0,Using it for about 4 months now. Heavy phone although has plastic body works fine storage is great charges fast Not yet facing any difficulty.
Worst phone . Amazon please return this phone .,1.0,Very poor quality phone. Camera and display quality is very poor. Poor than even 2 mega pixels camera.Display quality is worsed . Totally use less product.Doesn't meet any quality as advertised by samsung. .I don't want to give even 1 star to this phone.This is worst product of samsung.I want to return this phone.Amazon please return this phone
Grab on deal while the sale is live!,5.0,"In the sale, the phone was being sold for 10,500. With the exchange of other phone I got this phone for as low as 8,500.For that price it is a grab on deal. The Camera Quality is great when compared to phones in that price segment.Coming to rhe performance I also played COD mobile and it played seamlessly in medium settings.Overall the phone is good for the price 10,500"
Very low quality from Samsung,2.0,Fingerprint scanner is too slowTouchscreen doesn't respond 5/10 timesNeed to long press many times to get responseNetwork issue..This is review after using this phone for 5 days.Totally disappointed.
My product is not responding properly. Facing too many problems .Will u replace the product?,1.0,"SAMSUNG GALAXY M12 is not responding properly. (1) Suddenly switch off while on call (2) Most of the times ring tone will not come. (3) During transactions, the numbers in the key pad appear only half. (4) While calling, it will take too much time to connect (5) During work, suddenly goes back to home screen etc.Will u please replace the product?"
Buy Samsung M12 at you privacy risk,3.0,"The mobile comes with lots of bloatware. Needs to be trimmed. Also the contact list is not easy to use when a name has more than 1 contact. Most importantly, searching thru various notifications is difficilt. Privacy is at risk because the pictures keep changing everytime one presses the power button to start - which means all our actions are being recorded somewhere.I do not use thw Fingerprint reader but still it is asking to rate. So gave 1 star raring."
Delivers for the price range but please don't compare it with Samsung's high end offerings,5.0,"Haven't used it for too long but from the current usage these are the observations1. Battery life is good,  used it to stream movies and music but still worked out fine.2. Camera is ok, again based on specs for the price range.3. Would have liked better packaging and a back cover atleast."
Good phone with a weak battery,3.0,Battery is pathetic.  It's not 6000 mh battery. it drains very fast. Phone is ok for 10000 budget. Samsung quality has dropped.  Earlier Samsung phone had a superb quality.People buying this phone can go ahead. Good phone only battery  draining fast.I am using vivo y12. It's 5000 mh battery  but it last more than M12.
External warranty system is very upseting,1.0,"I bought external warranty but till date it is not activated. I called Amazon but they say for external warranty issue call to Samsung, I have called and also send many mails to Samsung. In last they say to send video of warrantity activation. Very upseting uncmplete process. Why Samsung not activate warranty from their side while purchasing new mobile."
"If you expect to use WIFI in 5GHz band at home , then Dont go for it; it supports only 2.4 GHz",4.0,"If you expect to use WIFI in 5GHz band at home , then Dont go for it; it supports only 2.4 GHz.  Really disappointed after got to know this. it was not highlighted specifically in the retail sites, info is available in Samsung site only.You cant full enjoy an internet speed at home, even if you have 5GHz band router"
All good to have rocket on pocket,5.0,Well if the question comes what I dislike  about  the phone is absolutely  nothing  it is a proper handy phone allows  to have a well grip. The quad camera  allows  to take  a full depth  of a picture enrich  in color and to take a true tone photo. The finger print is fast like thunder like a touch of your finger and opens in front  of you. The battery  is cool to use you could  say a PowerBar with phone and the make and feel of the phone is like your bide on the wedding night. A cool phone to use and recommend  others.
Phone is heavy and camera quality not good,3.0,Phone camera is not worth the quality mentioned and the device is also having more weight... Rethink if you want to buy this... Not sure why amazon removed return policy it's better to check phone locally in shop and buy
The worest mobile,1.0,"Plz don't buy this is worest mobile I never seen a device like this to worest if u buy this u will difently loss the this money, they are not accepting Return as well, worst service dee worest device from samsung @M13Plz DON'T BUY"
Review,3.0,Though it has 48 megha pixels camera.Reality is this it is equal 5megha pixels. This is series draw back.Secondly it is very heavy in weight.Fingure print is not upto the mark.Does not have image/pdf size reducer.
Plz don't  buy this phone,1.0,Horrible..bought  this phone on launch date.camera quality is worst..and the performance is below average. Don't waste your money by buying  this.Since I brought  it under replacement policy not able to return  it now. Worst phone from samsung
Not value for money,2.0,Bad in charging ( not a fast charging  phone take 4 to5 hours for charging)Also battery back is not good enough  drained in 8 hours similar as my earlier  phone .Screen display also not up to mark. ( pixels  are average)Sound quality  in both speakers is bad ( voice clarity  not good)Also phone is slow while operating ( taking pause while using)There are  good option other brands at similar  prices
Not bad for the given price,4.0,"I bought the phone the 6GB ram version and have been using it for three days now. Tge functions are smooth and the camera and screesize are great for the prize. It also gets fully charged in an hour. Will review again after a few more days. Can accomodate 2 sim cards plus a sd card simultaneously. Also the finish as the back is textured and matte, not glossy like it seems in the pictures."
Okay for the Price. but Bit Bulk,4.0,"For the Price Range, its decent Phone. Display & Camera is Average. Battery is Good. Its weighing 220 Gram. Even budget Redmi, Oppo Phones are in the Same Weight Range. So We can Buy Considering Samsung's Service and Quality."
Not expected  this poor service from such a big brand,1.0,"I purchased this after lots of analysis  and excited to use it but facing  such a cheap experience.I purchased few days back only and not able to hear incoming  voice, screen recording  is not available,  screenshot is not working.Defective Item.My brother also purchased same product  last year and he has same issue.He always  talk on speaker.Please do not buy samsung  product"
VERY BAD and WORST CUSTOMER Service. Just STEALING MONEY from the TRUSTED CUSTOMERS.,1.0,I have placed an order on 21st May and I could see the touch is not working properly. Initiated return request on the same day but till now no response from the Amazon on the return pickup. I raised a inspection twice and return pickup request twice.AMAZON started doing VERY BAD and WORST CUSTOMER Service. Just STEALING MONEY from the TRUSTED CUSTOMERS.
It is better phone from Samsung at this range.,3.0,"It is good looking and great user experience  with os is awesome. Display looks great.As I was redmi note 7 pro user, initially the phone seems bit slower in terms of performance ( launching apps, searching apps, unlocking using bio metric sensor).It feels bit heavier than my old phone.After all it is a worthy deal for 12000 rupees.I have exchanged it against the old redmi phone.Can go for this samsung product."
Good,5.0,Performance is very good. Battery is awesome. Can handle many applications at a time without lagging. Camera is good and video quality is also very impressive. Worth buying .

"Worst mobile , don’t go for this processor",1.0,"There is no zero rating that much worstFrequently getting hanging, I went for service center so many times also they told this mobile is like that only.My question is ?Then why they are still selling this mobile ?"
Samsung Galaxy M12,2.0,The mobile lacks in some of the basic features. Screen capture is a problem and other gunctionalities. You can't set a clock as screen saver. I feel the basic features that doesn't involve costs should be made available
Disgusting phone,1.0,Samsung is really worst company.many time I unable to receive the phone calls.I will never buy Samsung phones anymore. I don't know why they forcefully added their apps in the phone and you can't remove them.
Product was good but!!!,1.0,"The phone is good.Best for daily use, but if you will play heavy games you may face problem.Camera and built quality is also good.The main problem is with the delivery,The phone was broken and when I complained about it they said we can not do anything,Now I am using a broken phone without any of my fault.0 Star for Amazon!!!If you want to buy any product online don't consider Amazon."
Average phone,3.0,"Not a mobile you should have where you can spend 10-15k samsung isn't a brand u can trust on whether it is mobile or service. Instead purchase redmi, realme or any other brand."
Touch not upto the mark,4.0,Touch not good
Hi friends read this before oŕder,1.0,Hi friends don't purchase this phone with any expectation.Problem.1. Phone over heating during while charging2. Camera not equal to 48 MP3. Finger print reader not upto mark.It's on ordinary phone under 10k.Really disappoint with this product. Samsung failed to maintain their standard.
Sturdy and long lasting Mobile,5.0,"A sturdy phone with good battery and storage for rough and tough use. Camera is good with good quality front and back cameras. The 6.5"" dimension is very good for viewing videos. This at an affordable price makes it a paisa vasool mobile."
Worst Product and Display by Samsung,1.0,Poor product from Samsung. Even Xiaomi and other Chinese smartphone are faster than this. Very slow UI. Don't go with 90Hz refresh rate. That is useless. Most of the YouTube reviews are Paid. Don't buy this phone if your expectations are more as it doesn't match.
Excellent All rounder,5.0,"1 month since I bought it, excellent all rounder. Great performance, fast, nice camera for d price.Battery is too good, easily lasts 2 days with medium usage.I don't play games, so can't comment on Game performance.Camera is not d best, but for this price, I didn't expect much. Daylight pictures are really great. Video quality is also good."
Bulky and too much thick not looking like modern phone,1.0,Mobile is too bulky.. and thickness is too much 9.7 mm. Not looking like modern phone. Samsung pls work on weight and thickness. Customer won't require big battery give 5000mah is enough. Give some modern look with max 8.5 mAh thickness.. talk about procesdor its entry level processor of 6-7 k phones. But u give in 11k phone.. atleast use G35.
Waste of money,1.0,"Phone hangs several times and restarts automatically. Raised issue with Amazon customer care, but according to them, issue is not capturing in smartcheck app, hence can not be return or replace. Total waste of money."
Heating problem,3.0,The phone has started to heat from.back.side near the camera portion..20 mins of whats up usage....its.not.whats up call... Just a whats up.chat leads.to heating.....Samsung guys.pls help...I have bought in name of SAMSUNG as a good brand
Not gorilla glass,3.0,"Got for 8500 rupees.If this fall from your hand, display will crack for sure.Lot of software glitches.Battery backup for 1 and half days on moderate use."
"Great phone, but..",5.0,"It's a great phone from Samsung in budget series. I will not waste your time nor mine.so coming to the point all things are positive so I'm gonna tell you negative fingerprint reader is on the side on power button It's just okay quality. And other thing is cameras are also good but front one is just OK. But overall in this price range it's awesome and if you are confused between redmi 10 and Samsung m12  just go for it.It's just great and above all it's Samsung, 😉"
Never ever I am going to get any thing from samsung from amazon,1.0,Worst product from Samsung ibreally did not expect this from samsung and I really had more expectations about this productMore over this phone says 90 hz display bit it hangs a lot and it's like using a fake 3 class phone.I do not want the other customers to fall for the Advitisment of this device which is a total scam I would like to says people be careful and don't be a victim to this phone
Too heavy.,3.0,Too heavy. Have to carry a 1/4 of phone. Not fit for ladies. The microphone gives trouble within eight months. Now the return value is 5000 fixed when in warranty. Otherwise good if using it  at home only for ladies..
It's just amazing...loved it❤️,5.0,It's amazing!! It's really a monster reloaded version...works amazingly! Even the Amazon service was nice....it was not damaged when delivered..I has all new features...and is very satisfactory..just how android users need.. camera is nice too..n specially the cover it has got...is very grippy...the phn doesn't slip from hands😅
Low on specs,1.0,"What a horrible mobile it is, it does not have support for wifi 5 my 5 year old mobile has support to it, and wifi band signal catching capacity is worst, if you are going to use in your home wifi netwaork forget about using 5g bandSamsung f your self shame on you.you ahoud have mentioned in your discription"
Samsung Galaxy M12: The best!! Go for it!!,5.0,Just Go For It:Great Value!! Awesome Product!! Great Service!! Samsung is the real deal 👌👌👌Better than the Advertisement!!6GB Ram 6000 Battery! Good Screen!! Decent Processor!! Every thing you need to do Is but a Breeze for M12.Last but not the least!! KNOX Security!! You can Trust Samsung with your life.I am thankful and grateful to Samsung for a great companion!! 👍
Value for money,5.0,Perfect value phone. Has everything that one requires. For the price it is more than value It is a little heavy compares to others but not a deal breaker.. perfect for gifting to parents...
Superb phone and good design,5.0,The newly lahnched phone is packed with everything that can come blow 13k inr. The camera The battery and The design of The phone is perfect in every manner. I recommend this product if someone wants a good smartphone under 15k.
Overall performance is good,4.0,"I am using this phone from 5 days, on this basis I am just giving my feedback.1) Fingerprint reader is different as compare to other Android phones, and it's take some time to detect Fingerprint.2) Rear Camera quality is good but it's not like 48 mega pixels.3) Battery backup is good but its charge slowly.4) Overall performance is good with this price."
Not recommended at all,1.0,I thought of buying Samsung thinking of its brand value and brand name and quality. But it really sucks.. the phone hangs every now and then. Camera doesn't function properly. The handset is too heavy.
Junk Phone,1.0,"Their is no negative rating option, so i have to give 1 rating to this junk phone.  DON'T BUY this device, after 5 day only its screen become blank tried all possible trouble shooting available online, but this junk phone didn't recover. Finally i have to go to service centre and from their also pathetic response i have to visit 3 different service centre to get this repair. Didn't except such a pathetic product from Samsung."
Budget smartphone,3.0,"If you are looking for a phone with minimum features and just able to deliver day to day task like calling etc, then I would recommend this. BUT this phone lags behind in many features like always on display,screen color mode etc, so this phone is not for someone who is looking for good features in a phone. Front camera is horrible. Instead go for Realme 8i, its a beast with tons of features."
Worst device,1.0,"Initially when I purchased I had a problem with it's speaker after the instructions followed for fixing now the device is overheating while charging , also when I'm using for even small applications like Google meet its not even a heavy application like COD . I advise you to not buy this device it has so many issues like this, Worst experience ever and it's only been a month since I have purchased it from Amazon."
Value for price. Better finger print reader expected.,4.0,The phone built quality seems good. The weight is a little more than expected. Battery life and camara is good. Latest version of Android is also provided. Better finger print reader was expected. Bigger size scanner on back would be better.
Just average phone.,3.0,"Samsung is providing better phone now but this m12 is less than average. Average display, average battery and charging. U can buy it for your father or mother, means who don't use it more would love to buy it."
Don't Buy!! Humble request,1.0,"Complete waste of money. So many big issues in this phone.. camera quality, bulky phone, 5g wifi connectivity not there, front camera bad, network issue."
Problem in call feature,3.0,"Phone is otherwise good but the most important task of any phone, which is calling has some issues. Call feature sometimes hang. Camera sometimes become out of focus and so image gets blur."
Excellent Mobile & looks Slim and Stylish,5.0,I've been using this for some days now and I have to say it's been great. The phone is really sleek and screen resolution is very good. Camera is excellent in Good lighting... Under poor light or night time it may not do so well. Phone is really beautiful though.

Extremely slow response,1.0,The phone has really slow response. After clicking on something you have to wait forever. Sometimes when doing multiple functions the phone hangs. Didn't expect this from Samsung. I miss my Redmi
Good Purchase,4.0,"Can be deliver early but, knowingly delayed. Night time battery discharging more %. Battery-time usage time less discharge but, Night time idle time more discharging. Camera not tested yet will update later"
"Don't be fooled by the Brand name of ""Samsung"" attached to this item",1.0,There are better options available at this price which offer good performance and interface.Very slow and messy touch screen . Not happy with it after a months use.
Well done Samsung,4.0,"Complete package, truly it's a Monster Reloaded. Everything from Camera to Speed to Interface is perfect. Only negative thing is that it's bit thick & heavy. It's a Made in India Product."
Very Worst Product Very worst,1.0,"I bought Redmi Y2 on 2018 in amazon, its works well now also, but This phone Samsung M12 bought on 2021 not even properly works for 1 year.  Very Worst Product ever i used.  Waste of Money. Cheap Plastic, Cheap Screen, Cheap Camera. Overall Waste of Money.  Its not ever worth for 1 start but there is minus starts so i gave 1 star rated."

pathetic amazon service,1.0,screen broken. amazon claims that there is one time free screen replacement warrantee for Prime. i am not able to claim warrantee. product support section of amazon is not working.
Value for money,5.0,Camera is the best of all without a doubt. Device is very smooth and it can be used 2 days or more if you don't use heavily.I am a heavy user with lots of phone calls and heavy using of youtube. Phone is heavy because of it's massive 6000 mah battery. Every thing is fine if you don't play heavy games we can play games under 400mb smoothly.Smooth device writing this after 2 months of usage loving it. 🔥😍
Headset not in box.,3.0,"The description said in box headset, charger, and manual will come in box with this phone, but headset is not there."
Pretty Good.,4.0,"If you are interested in a budget camera phone, this one isn't for you.This phone is pretty smooth. Works for people who don't use phones much like me.Battery life is awesome and I'm enjoying it but cable is a bit short.Overall good phone, would recommend this one if u are really low on budget but if you can spend a bit more, just get the Samsung m30s or m31.This phone just needs improvement in camera and otherwise this is a decent budget phone."
Nice phone to use if your usage is very low,4.0,Nice product to use if your usage is minimal basically this phone is for people who is not interested more in gaming if so it will lag some
Budgeted phone with good quality features.,5.0,"This review is after using phone for 1 week.Likes-Under 10k budget  this phone is very good to use, it's having  almost features like a 14-15k phone,camera quality is also good.My usage of phone is more would say whole day so by the EOD I left with 20-30%batteryDislikes-what I was in need of I dint get that is Wifi-calling option in this phone.Main drawback is if battery reaches below 40- 50 it takes really long time to get fully charged up."
I got Display problem after 1.5 month.,1.0,Even YouTube videos are running screen getting turned off automatically and sound goes normal. This problem is happening unevenly. I have used very gently as it new device and I facing this problem. Please don't waste your money here .be careful with what you are getting

Good Phone.,5.0,"Light weight, lovely colour.UI is good.Camera settings had to be changed as the default picture quality was set to 5MP. After a software update, I could change it to the right MP."
Ok..ish budget samsung phone under 10k!,3.0,Ok..ish budget samsung phone under 10k... camera is average...design is ok..battery is satisfactory for now...not a big fan of Samsung user interface and  samsung preloaded apps coz they are uncessary and can't be removed
Ok In This Budget.,4.0,"Overall in this budget the phone is ok.Primary camera is good, but doesn't seems to be true 48 mp. If you're a selfie lover then dont buy this phone, because the front camera is worst.Decent battery life, can lasts upto 1 and a half day with average use.Processor saw some improvements, asphalt 9 and call of duty is running alright but not smooth. 90 mhz screen is a pure lie by the samsung, the TFT display is poorly managed on the hardware. Fast charging is there."
Camera quality is not very good,3.0,"Camera quality is not as expected,  we can consider a low budget phone. Finger print reader doesnt works some times. Battery backup is great, built quality is nice."
Bluetooth connectivity issue in Samsung M12 mobile and it also not supports 5G.,2.0,There is a Bluetooth connectivity issue in Samsung M12 mobile and it also not supports 5G.

Notice the best one👌👌👌,5.0,I am really impressed with the phone... As its the best budget buy...... I am enjoying the quality of clicks plus the great backup of battery..... Including other features as well.....loved it
"good one, not a great one",4.0,"got this ph @9999 in offer. the touch, sensor are really bad. especially face recognition, which never recognizes me.application opening, processor speed with min 5 applications and battery life are good"
Used just 15 days so can't give full feedback but will mention few key positive and negative,3.0,"Good about product- battery  is superb- camera is Ok Ok not so good as expected from 48MP camera- easy to operateNegatives- processing is concern , very slow response of touch , even my three years led phone give better touch response- hindi typing is tedious process which must be easy like other phones- charging time is 3 hours so not so quick"
Want a Replacement,1.0,Sometimes incoming and outgoing call voice not works..bad bad bad...this haopend within 15 days after purchase..I want to replace this mobile pls avail replacment...
Very Bad seller and Mobile,1.0,"Not up to the mark. there is no return policy.thickness is very much . Already someone used and Registered their account in Samsung , they sold to me this very bad . Amazon has to take action on this. Mobile also not working."
What is the performance of the phone,4.0,"Nice product! I like it so much, battery life is too good I do not drain more the 50% of battery after heavy usage. Camera quality is good, processor is so amazing for day to day usage, fingerprint works pretty well, charing speed is normal. Overall, nice product for day to day usage. And thanks flipkart for so delivery very! I ordered it on 18/03/2021 and get it one 20/03/2021! Thanks flipkart again for fast delivery and a value for money and budget phone in only 11,000 rupees"
Not for me!!,1.0,This is my secondary phone. My primary one is iPhone 7plus which is more than 5 years old now and still smooth as it was on the first day.I would not advise this Samsung mobile to anyone. Touch screen is worse. Started lagging in the first few days. Finger-print and face-detection sensors are just for show.
Value for money,4.0,It is a good mobile at price of 10k. It is not for heavy usage like gameing or rendering but can be used by elderly people or people with less work on it.
Not bad,4.0,Not bad for my needs as I'm not a PUBG fanboy... good for elderly people.. go for Galaxy F22(G80) or M21-2021(Exy9611) if you're looking for a better gaming XP.. Camera suffers in low light but pretty solid in daylight.. Software is well optimised unlike Mi and Realme.. Quite a bit overpriced..Not Bad but certainly not the Best.. Galaxy F22 has better XP.. M03s has better Value
"Vivo ,oppo is better than samsung",2.0,Only battery life is better rest all is worse. Fingerprint sometimes not work and camera operation is worst part.
3mahine se toh ekdm shi chal ra hai,5.0,Sab kuch bhandia hai bs ek chiz samsung ki joh shuru se khrb hai ki thoda sa 2 3 week me 1 bar hang ho jata hi 1 2 sec k lie. Baki agar mobile ki bat kre toh thoda bhari v hai or mota v hai ek bar offline chala k dhekh lo fir online khreed lo.
The worst model from samsung.,1.0,"The worst mobile I have bought from samsung. I have been a premium samsung customer in past where I haven't faced any issues. But for this model, by day 16 the display is not seen and I can't replace the mobile even in Amazon and also in samsung. The battery is getting heated up. I suggest not to buy this model because I have an issue in camera which I have replaced and faced the above issue with the second buy."
Voice issues in device,1.0,"within 5 months of purchasing there is voice issues in mobile. Not able to hear talk from other side suddenly and need to switch off and on mobile frequently, after switching on the mobile there wont be any voice issues for couple of hours but again the issue will arise after some time, after restarting the device, again for some this issue will get resolved. Currently restarting the device min for 10 times in a day."
"Better battery, poor camera..",3.0,First impressions:Pros : 2 days battery life if internet is used constantly.RAM is enough to handle the heavy apps smoothly.Runs on latest Android version and Samsung UI.Cons:So so camera quality as compared to similar price range products.

There pick up service are too much poor and behaviour or delivery person is rudly,1.0,Amazon pick up service is very poor and there delivery boy who pick up the product there behaviour was very rud and unsetify...since 15 days I try too returd this M12 galaxy phn but they not tack it back and they suffer me since 15 days ...So don't belive on Amazon don't purchase any item from them ..they are not capable too solve consumer problems and belives
"Not even 6 months , display lost , worst phone ever",1.0,"Brought this phone in Apr 2021 , kept it for charging when the battery was down and after after hours the display was gone . Don’t suggest anyone to buy this phone ."
Good Samsung phone but bulky.,2.0,Like the Samsung brand experience but it's motherboard failure within 2 months disappointed. Battery life is good lasting for 2 full days! More bulky n weight.

Great battery but heavy and lags a bit .,4.0,"Weight is heavy other than that it is worth the money , but since battery is big and works very long it is heavy . Little slow at opening the apps, sometimes apps lag, but i hope it will work for long time . You dont need to worry about charging the phone often, once fully charged even if used continuously it stands for one day."
"Good Storage and Camera, Disspoint WLAN No 5 GHZ and frequent Network drop",3.0,"I had purchased M31 and wanted to get a second phone, so got this.Latest OS , Good RAM and internal storage,disappointing  its released in Feb-2021, but didn't provide a 5 ghz WLAN connectivity (my mistake based on M31 thought this will also be available based on release date), also the Network signal gets lost very often.Though it can be expanded to 1TB, would recommend spend an additional INR 4-5K and get M31.Couldn't return."
I never recommended Samsung Galaxy M12,1.0,I never recommended Samsung Galaxy M12 because is function is not smooth and more critical problem is mobile hang even in opening of simple application.

Also unnecessary application is installed that would be never used by anyone.
A great phone at great price..,4.0,"Real battery monster, good RAM & processor performance. At this budget, getting these 2 key features is a great deal.

Heavy AF!,3.0,Not upto the mark I'd say. I regret not checking the weight before placing the order of this phone for my sister. She started using it anyway without complaining about the weight.

Value for money only if the fast changing was there,3.0,"100% battery charging takes 3hrs of time were slow changing but the battery life is wow it's super, camera quality is super it's just been 3days if any other issues I will update my review in future."

Heavy phone,4.0,Obviously battery is 6000 maH the phone is very heavy and feels like a brick in hand.The battery life is not that great but satisfied as a non gaming phone.Don't buy this if you are looking for a phone with good performance during playing games.

Greatest phone everrrr,5.0,"This is an amaazing phone. It has advanced features of expensive phones like face recognition, quad camera etc for a low price. Very much worth it. But one small thing might be that it's heavier than an average phone. Overall it's really worth your money."

POOR CAMERA QUALITY & LONG CHARGING TIME,4.0,Battery  Performance  Long Lasting  But It Takes More Than Two & Half Hour To Complete Charge  So There  Is Nothing Like Fast Charging  (think self 15w charger for 6000mah battery) Camera Quality Poor As They Call It 48 Megapixel Camera But Actually It Don't Take Proper Zooming Shots (more u can guess self) And Rest All Features Are Best As My Own Understanding For Such Budget .
Good,4.0,As we know Samsung is a leading worth brand. I bought this mobile 2 months before. Up to today it is working well. Cemera accessiblty should be improve. Un necessary apps and ads showing. But quality is good.

Samsung M12: An overall disappointment,2.0,This phone has disappointed me from various viewpoints. The phone hangs off and on. Processor is just ok. Camera is horrible. There is nothing like 48 MP. Internet is choked too often and you need to clear memory. The only thing this phone is good about is its immensely powerful battery. Long lasting and quick charging. Fingerprint reader is very inconveniently placed and of very low calibre.

Sorry can't recommend in d Amazon platform,1.0,"The touch is awfully unresponsive..Ys without any protective glass, which fails as a touch device in the first place..in these days of loaded cameras, this is kind of ok. so is the battery.

Value for money but can't do heavy gaming,4.0,For me it's processor all that matters n as I had a low budget I got it for me so if you want to buy this mobile it's a efficient mobile only normal apps we ca run snap insta nd all but bgmi like heavy game we can't play n it has only 2ghz wifi support not even 5ghz nd it's a good mobile I can say If you want to buy go for it
Dissapointed product,2.0,Very dissapointed product.Not value for Money.If it is for rs.8000 it is OK.Only positive feedback is Battery backup.Camera- Not good front and rear.Finger print- Not comfirtable.NO default call recording option.If you having tru call then we can recordLittle more weght compared to other smart phone. And having hang for some times.
Very nice flagship phone,5.0,"The phone is best buy, in terms of pricing and features. I guess this is the best option if someone is looking for a good Samsung phone at a proper budget"
Best phone in this price range,4.0,"Loved this phone, especially battery life is amazing,  I can easily go without charging for 2 days. I m not a heavy user though I play CoD once a day and response is good, doesn't lag at all.

It is ok,4.0,Not the best but Also not the worst. Frame rate drops sometimes. Battery is not very promising.Over all average product for its price range.Buy it only for someone who doesn't game or use their phone whole day.
Awesome Phone,5.0,"Received the phone on time as promised. The battery backup is just fabulous - 6000 mAh definitely the power backup requirement that every phone needs. Easy to use phone, but some apps are pre loaded which can be deleted if not using. But definitely way ahead than all the other chinese brands. With 6Gb RAM, using the phone is as smooth as silk. I would recommend this phone with the 6GB / 128GB config to others."
Nothing good in Samsung Mobile. Canera & Cgargibg speed is too bad,1.0,"Review Summary: I bought two Samsung phone and both have below cons. A21- Rs 18000, M12-10500Dislike: Charging Speed too low, Camera is very bad. Phone is quite slow as compared to other rivalary phone. Too heavy. In short Phone is very costly as compared to its features. Touch screen is also not so fast. Sometimes it doesnt work.Samsung seriously need to work on the above problems."

Not suggestabel,2.0,"More weight, and camera quality is too bad. Not even giving the quality of 2mp camera. Completely stoped using camera in this mobile. Name sake it's 48mp. Other brands of 5mp will give more picture clarity than this mobile"
Poor Camera Quality,2.0,I guess I have received defective product. Photo quality is worst. 2mega pixel photos or low quality even in bright sunlight.

Awesome phone,5.0,"Awesome phone. Amazing Battery backup, Charge it to 100% and even after usage and travelling it stays to 80% till evening.

"I found charging point is not working, highly disappointed.",1.0,"Charging point in mobile is not working and as this one is my second mobile I started it bit late and return period is over, this one is made in  India Samsung Mobile."
Poor front camera quality,3.0,It is a worthy mobile.Con's.Samsung provided normal travel adapter for charging. Which it take almost 2-3 hours to get full.Front camera is not that much good. I disappointed with this.Trasperant case is not provided. For other mobile every one will provide. Samsung is not providing this.
Perfect  phone for below 12K ₹,5.0,"This phone is a budget  phone  which  will help with long 1 and half day  battery life with always full brightness, location and data on .  Camera is  good  on pro mode  but cannot  be compared  with  high  pixel phones.  6 GB ram is enough  for play  games. This phone has enough  fps for games like  pubg, asphalt  games  no lag."
Poor Camera quality,3.0,I have bought this mobile for my daughter and she was very disappointed with the Camera quality. It was just a 5 megapixel camera. Poor video and photo quality. First time I disappointed with the brand like Samsung. Better to go for Redmi note 9 or 9pro.
Samsung M12 is a good handset but seems to be heavy. Finishing is awesome.,5.0,M12 build is good. Handset is little bit heavy. Camera quality is 50:50. Battery life is awesome. With Android 11 browsing is faster. Fingerprint on right side works well.
Excellent good brand phone in this range,3.0,"Excellent phone in this range, with good battery, only thing of concern is its finger print reader location, many times login error appears due to different finger or hand location getting accidently touched to finger print reader, which is a bit annoying."
WiFi connectivity issue,4.0,"Overall good, Finger print unlock is more smooth and is on the right side below volume button to easily unlock. Camer is OK .Battery life is also good. I had faced WiFi connectivity issue. Thats why returned the product"

Battery gets very hot while charging using mobile data and wifi.  Need to charge it when its off.,1.0,"the battery gets very hot , when you keep it on charge while mobile is working with wifi and data . If you keep it charged for long , it shall cause problem.

Does not support 5GHz Wifi,1.0,"The phone is good, but it does not support 5GHz Wifi. There is no workaround and all you have to do is work on slow speed WiFi (2.4GHz)Think before purchasing 👍"
Please look for alternatives,1.0,"The main problem is the beautiful processor called Exynos. Under normal use, sometimes you would have to press a button 3-4 times for it to recognize.How do the other features matter if just checking a message would want to make you throw the phone away in frustration."
A decent phone with 4GB RAM.,4.0,It looks like its a good purchase. both the sims are loaded. all are looking fine. Did not tax with many apps. Looks decent for around 10K purchase. More importantly its Samsung. Not any China origin/based company phones. So you dont pay directly for the bullets they pump back at us.
Mobile not good,1.0,Mobile lene k 15 din baad hi.. Uske loudspeaker m problem hone lgi... Aur 5-6 din baad hanging problem hone lgi....
Overpriced,2.0,"Touch sensor function horrible, pathetic and annoying. It lets you down repeatedly during day to day activity. Bad experience with my first Samsung smart phone."
It is almost all in one. I like it more than other mobile phones I had purchased herebefore.,4.0,"I like Note Application more. Calender application is yet need to be upgraded as Events are seen serially as in Intex Aqua Trend Mobile. Camara quality is good, battery life is also good. I havn't used fingerprint yet."
Missing Dual band Wifi,3.0,"Phone is just okay similar to m30, m31s. However this phone misses to have dual band wifi. Supports only 2.5 Ghz wifi band limiting the wifi speed. Unable to make of 5Ghz wifi for higher speed."
Poor Camera quality not many options.,1.0,"Camera quality is below par than the 12MP old phones. Poor Customer service. No call recórding option, No ultra power saving mode. Never buy Samsung phones it's last its quality. Attached photos for reference. Samsung blaming Amazon saying they provided the defect piece to me.

Not happy with software,3.0,"There is a software problem, whenever you make a call for the 1st time the speaker is not activated and so you can't hear anything the person on the other side is speaking. But if you disconnect it and call again it works fine. Initially i thought its network issue but later i realised it happens every time i try to make i call after a considerable time gap like an hour or so."
Good value for money,4.0,"Good value for money. Bought it for my parents. Screen is large, so easy for them to use. However Samsung should think of making it lighter. Good build quality, good camera."
Camera not given 100%,3.0,"Camera quality is not at par. Samsung also doing as china. Shown 48 megapixel camera, but in-fact it may lower than 5 megapixel only.Samsung have to do something"
Good Mobile,4.0,"Good mobile but not the best one. The adaptor has charging issues from the first day of usage, also battery drains fast with even normal usage. Software and UI are good, all the features are good. But I would recommended Samsung M21 instead of Samsung M12."

Brand value not maintaining,1.0,"Not recommended, network issue. Hanging issue continues with Samsung as like always.As a big brand Samsung is not performing like a brand.

Not happy,1.0,"This phone having lots of bugs, i bought it for my papa and he is saying it's too slow to respond the keypad and software is crashing overall disappointment"
Steal Deal!!!!,5.0,Samsung never dissapointed me. The mobile at the price of 10999/- is a steal deal. The 6000mAh battery is a power house with excellent backup. The 48 MP camera is capturing good pictures. Display is quite good. I am totally satisfied with the phone.
LOUSY PRODUCT,1.0,its giving a lot of trouble.  do not buy this product. within 6 months it has broken down.  it keeps turning off.

Samsung always nails it.,5.0,Bought this phone for my grandmother. Simple & refined UI easy to operate with nice features. Overall build quality is good with nice to have in pocket.
Only good battery.,2.0,Battery is goodCamera is not good. Zoom the images or a pic taken using zoom and all details are lost. Hoping Samsung release some update to improve it. It has pre-installed and unwanted apps so usable memory is less than expected. May be Samsung can keep these on cloud rather than phone and leave a choice to the user.
Greater battery life,2.0,If u need battery life more u can go otherwise u may purchase different product.Camera quality is not good.No security application.Charging takes 3 hrs to full
Utter Waste M13,1.0,Phone is very slow as if it has just 1GB RAM. There is considerable lag after each touch. Nowadays each Samsung phone is better known for their VERY POOR PERFORMANCE. Don't waste your money on this CRAP. Better go with Moto or other phones.
"Minor lag in UI ,Noticed.",4.0,"This device is awesome if u get it under 10,000.I got it @9,998.There is a miner lag in UI and it gets heat up (not quickly)if u use it for gaming.Camera is outstandingDisplay is goodSound is goodLooks is goodProcesser is avg(as we know😑)And last not the least - Battery is like a big MONSTER.Lasts upto 2.5 days ."
Overall good product but not the best one,3.0,Finger print reader is moderate. Battery life is good. Rear Camera doesn't look like 48mp
Only for very decent work..........not at all for high performing tasks.,2.0,Fingerprint senser is not so sensitive. One has to put his/her finger very tightly.Battery charges slow since it supports 15 watt charger. It drains faster if adaptive motion is set to 90 hz.Camera quality is decent but it should be improved. In 48 mp mode flash will not work.It's backlight remains always on due to which processor is heated.Speakers are very slow.
Only plus good battery,3.0,"I have samsung a50, comparing the camera quality this M12 is dull and poor inspite this being quad camera setup. Only this battery life is good. And provided the budget can't complain much. But still there are many good camera quality smart phones available in this range. Advice you all to check in person and then order the device"
